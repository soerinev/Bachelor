18209165," The Future of Europe Hinges on a Face-Off in France <h> Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron have become symbols of either the ratification or the rejection of the populist wave that led to Brexit and Trump . <p> For many French voters , the Presidential race has offered no good choices.CreditPhotograph by Oscar B. Castillo for The New Yorker <p> On the evening of April 20th , nearly a quarter of France 's television-watching public was tuned in to a special called  15 Minutes pour Convaincre .  Its format was simple : each of eleven Presidential candidates would appear and speak for fifteen minutes , making a final pitch to the electorate -- a full third of whom , according to analysts , remained undecided , just days before the first of two rounds of voting . The hosts asked each candidate to present an object that , if elected , he 'd keep in his office at the ? lys ? e . Jean-Luc M ? lenchon ( who had created his own far-left movement , La France Insoumise ) chose an alarm clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth .  Nathalie Arthaud ( Lutte Ouvri ? re ) brandished a photograph of Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising gloved fists at the 1968 Olympics . Marine Le Pen ( representing the extreme-right Front National ) came with a key , saying that she wanted to give French people their house back . Nicolas Dupont-Aignan ( Debout la France ) brought a wire sculpture that a handicapped child had given him , and then whipped out his cell phone and began reading a series of text messages from a  big media boss  who , he said , had tried to bully him into dropping out of the race . <p> It was around this time that viewers , fiddling with their own devices , began to receive notifications about some sort of shooting on the Champs- ? lys ? es . One of the hosts interrupted the broadcast to announce that a possible terrorist attack had taken place . Then he introduced Philippe Poutou ( Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste ) , a trade unionist who 'd made an impression at the previous debate by showing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without saying a word about the attack , Poutou launched into his show-and-tell session .  This is green for the richness of the soil of the Amazon forest ,  he said , unfurling a miniature flag -- an homage , he said , to French Guiana , where crowds had been in the streets for weeks protesting mistreatment by the mainland government . <p> When Emmanuel Macron ( the founder of the centrist movement En Marche ! ) came out , he said he 'd picked his childhood grammar book but had left it in the greenroom , given the gravity of the moment .  The first duty of the President is to protect ,  he asserted . Later , Fran ? ois Fillon ( the candidate of the center-right Les R ? publicains ) , declaring that he was n't  a fetishist ,  dodged the whole exercise , and , not to be outdone by Macron , announced that he was cancelling the next day 's campaign events . <p> By late April , French Presidential campaigns have usually settled into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Republicans , but this race was a free-for-all . According to polls , four candidates -- M ? lenchon , Macron , Fillon , and Le Pen -- all had a viable shot at progressing to the two-person runoff , to be held on May 7th . M ? lenchon wanted a nationalist economy but a globalist identity , Macron wanted a globalist economy and a globalist identity , Fillon wanted a globalist economy but a nationalist identity , and Le Pen wanted a nationalist economy and a nationalist identity . The world was looking to the French election as either a ratification or a rejection of the populist surge that had led to Brexit and Trump . The balance of power among America , Europe , and Russia was also at stake . With four candidates hovering somewhere in the vicinity of twenty per cent , the permutations of possible matchups and outcomes were almost too complicated to contemplate . <p> This was clearly a  change election  -- or , to hear it from French voters , a race in which they 'd been presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so enraged that they could hardly see straight , much less render their vote a coherent expression of their fears and aspirations . No matter how they leaned , their first words , when asked to comment on la pr ? sidentielle , were more often than not  J'en ai marre ,  or  I 'm fed up .  The political analyst Brice Teinturier believed that the disappointing administrations of the two previous Presidents had led to the rise of a powerful group of voters , whom he christened the PRAF Party . The acronym stood for  plus rien ? faire , plus rien ? foutre  -- nothing more to do , nothing more to give a damn about . One day , I got to talking with the proprietor of an antique shop , who said ,  You want to start another French Revolution of 1789 and cut off all their heads .  <p> In January , a story in Le Monde had likened the contest to something out of a Quentin Tarantino film ,  one of those B-movie pastiches where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ' smoked ' by a Magnum to the head .  At that point , Fillon ( a former Prime Minister ) had vanquished Nicolas Sarkozy ( a former President ) , winning the R ? publicains ' primary in a surprise landslide . Macron had committed a  patricide  of his former mentor , the sitting President Fran ? ois Hollande , by quitting as Minister of the Economy and setting up En Marche ! , at the age of thirty-eight . Hollande , with an approval rating of four per cent and an unemployment rate of ten , had declined to seek re ? lection , an unprecedented surrender . His Prime Minister , Manuel Valls , sought the Socialist nomination , but was unexpectedly trounced in the primary by Beno ? t Hamon , a former Minister of Education , whose platform included a universal basic income and a tax on robots . This was all before prosecutors put Fillon under formal investigation for misuse of public funds ( according to allegations , he paid his wife and children parliamentary salaries for work they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who ignored a summons to testify about a fake-jobs scandal of her own ) . Then M ? lenchon , an ex-Trotskyist who wanted to tax earnings of more than four hundred thousand euros at a hundred per cent , began soaring in the polls . <p>  15 Minutes pour Convaincre  did n't end until nearly eleven o'clock . In the following hours , the specifics of the attack emerged . Karim Cheurfi , a French citizen and ex-convict , had opened fire on a parked police cruiser , killing Xavier Jugel ? -- a proudly gay policeman who was a first responder at the Bataclan massacre -- and injuring three others . Police shot Cheurfi as he tried to escape on foot . According to prosecutors , a note praising ISIS was found near his body . Jugel ? was the two hundred and thirty-ninth person since the beginning of 2015 to lose his life in a terrorist attack on French soil . French people kept their composure ; they did n't need a tweet from Donald Trump (  Will have a big effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news had thrown the race , which commentators kept describing as  totalement in ? dit  ( completely unheard of ) , into even greater chaos . Three days later , Macron and Le Pen progressed to the second round , garnering 24.01 and 21.3 per cent , respectively , of the vote . <p> The last time a French Presidential election was anywhere near this wild was in 2002 . Jacques Chirac , the center-right President , was supposed to face Lionel Jospin , the center-left Prime Minister . ( The two men had been sharing power in a  cohabitation  government . ) The extreme-right candidate , Jean-Marie Le Pen -- Marine 's father , an eyepatch-wearing former paratrooper and gleeful racist , who famously called the Holocaust a  detail  of history -- had been polling a weak fourth . But in the first round of voting , he came in second , propelling him to a runoff against Chirac , who was embroiled in a corruption scandal .  Le choc Le Pen  galvanized both the political establishment and the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest banded together to repel Le Pen . More than a million citizens took to the streets , some bearing signs that read ,  Vote for the Crook , Not the Fascist .  Ultimately , Chirac received more than eighty-two per cent of the vote , the most decisive victory in French history . <p> The 2002 election was in ? dit because Jean-Marie Le Pen , considered so unthinkable that the French national soccer team issued a statement condemning his racism , made it to the second round of voting . This year 's election is in ? dit not only because Marine Le Pen , considered so thinkable that both Brigitte Bardot and the President of the United States have praised her , is within reach of the Presidency but also because Macron , who has never held elected office , has become the front-runner a year after putting together a party from scratch . As soon as the results of the first round were announced , a parade of establishment figures declared their support for Macron , in an attempt to form a  barricade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prime Minister addressed the nation on live television , urging citizens  to fight the Front National and doom its catastrophic projects .  <p> Marine , the youngest of three Le Pen daughters , was born in 1968 . After the family 's Paris apartment was bombed , in 1976 -- Marine woke up to a blown-away bedroom wall -- they moved to a Second Empire mansion in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud , which an elderly industrialist had bequeathed to Jean-Marie . ( The estate  smells of death ,  one of her sisters told a journalist , but Marine continued to live there until 2014 . ) According to Marine 's autobiography , both of her parents were spectacularly inattentive . When Marine was sixteen , her mother , Pierrette , left Jean-Marie for his biographer . Jean-Marie banished her from the family , saying ,  If you want money , go clean houses .  She posed for Playboy scrubbing the floor . <p> Without any particular encouragement , except the feeling that she 'd been blocked from society on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 2002 , she was coming into her own in the F.N. A criminal lawyer , she 'd joined the Party 's executive committee . After a string of defeats -- running for the national legislature , she blamed the Socialist Party for five hundred thousand HIV infections -- she 'd finally won a seat on a regional council . She 'd recently divorced her husband , an F.N. operative and the father of her three children . Soon , she married another Party activist , and again divorced . ( Her current companion , Louis Aliot , is the F.N. 's vice-president . ) Defending her father on television , she launched her reputation as a rivetingly aggressive interlocutor , banging the table and taking her arguments , delivered in a commanding smoker 's voice , past their logical ends .  She had an assertiveness , a glibness , and a prodigious bad faith that promised a fine career in the media ,  a journalist later said . <p> Meanwhile , Macron was training at the ? cole Nationale d'Administration , France 's ? lite civil-service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd arrived in Paris in 1997 . He 'd been sent there , alone , to finish high school after falling in love with Brigitte Trogneux , a member of a prominent family of local chocolatiers . She was married , the mother of three children , and his drama teacher . ( Macron and Trogneux wed in 2007 , when he was twenty-nine and she was fifty-four . ) As an undergraduate , Macron studied philosophy . Then , at Sciences Po , he earned a master 's in public affairs . He was a prodigy , serving as an assistant to the phenomenologist Paul Ric ? ur , and an enigma , taking the train to Amiens every Friday to see Trogneux . Aur ? lien Lechevallier , a friend and adviser , remembers him dressing in  an East Coast Ivy League jacket  when his peers were wearing T-shirts . Lechevallier told me ,  I think when we met he had no real experience of living lightly with friends -- just making jokes , having a couple of beers at the bar .  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ En Marche ! in April , 2016 .  This is n't a movement to have an umpteenth candidate in the Presidential election ,  he said . Very few people thought he 'd succeed .  I would be sorry if Emmanuel Macron wanted to escape , to undertake some sort of personal adventure ,  Fran ? ois Hollande confided to a journalist .  Not because it would be a betrayal but because it would be hopeless . It would be a waste .  He added ,  The system is voracious , it would crush him .  <p> Provence-Alpes-C ? te d'Azur ( PACA ) , a region that occupies the eastern half of France 's Mediterranean coastline , has one of the highest rates of immigration in the country . It is a Front National stronghold : twenty-eight per cent of its residents -- the second-highest rate in France -- voted for Marine Le Pen in the first round . Le Pen 's platform calls for , among other things , outlawing dual citizenship with most countries , banning foreign languages in schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that her election would mean the end of the E.U. ) Just before the first round of voting , she announced a plan to implement a moratorium on legal immigration ,  to stop this delirium .  So far , the F.N. has been unable to win more than a handful of seats in France 's legislature . But , in the 2014 municipal elections , the Party clinched eleven mayoralties , seven of them in PACA . An opposition party for almost half a century , the F.N. is trying to prove that it can govern in places like Le Luc en Provence ( pop . 10,621 ) . <p> In February , when I visited Le Luc , the mimosa trees were exploding with blooms . To a foreign eye , Le Luc looked like a picturesque village out of a Proven ? al fantasy , all golden light and chalky pastel fa ? ades . A tourist might have happily assumed that the preponderance of shuttered storefronts indicated the persistence of some charming southern siesta tradition , but , in fact , they had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty per cent , double the national average ; fifty-six per cent of its citizens do n't earn enough money to pay income taxes . I could n't find a boulangerie , the classic French barometer of a town 's healthy environment . A vandal had taken a hammer to one of the windows at the Caf ? de la Mairie . <p> Pascal Verrelle , Le Luc 's mayor , received me at the town hall . He is Le Luc 's third F.N. mayor since 2014 , the first having resigned for health reasons , and the second having resigned also supposedly for health reasons ( but not before sending a letter to the local paper saying that she was quitting because her team reproached her for  not being F.N. enough  ) . Apparently , there had been some drama over a European Union flag that hung outside the town hall . When Verrelle took over , it came down . Verrelle led me up to his office . A former prison official with a buzzcut , he was wearing a khaki jacket and a lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I wanted to know why , in Verrelle 's opinion , the people of the town had put the F.N. in power . He said that their vote had not necessarily been for the most attractive party but for the one with which they were least acquainted .  Little by little , they told themselves , ' We have to try something else , '  Verrelle said . He continued ,  There were people who thought that we were going to construct watchtowers , that we were going to put up walls to separate the neighborhoods , that we were going to walk around with police dogs , that we were going to kick the foreigners out . Then they realized that we 're no more racist than anyone else , just a little more nationalist .  <p> Verrelle 's budget was small and his agenda modest : he spoke of having decreased the town 's debt ( he 'd served a ros ? sangria rather than champagne at the annual New Year 's reception ) , solved its trash problem ( he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired four new police officers (  including two maghr ? bins  -- North Africans --  who are excellent  ) . But despite his claim of representing some harmless arithmetic mean of racism , he touched on many of the F.N. 's identitarian themes .  I have nothing against immigrants , the real immigrants ,  he said . But today , he told me , they were all  young men , between twenty-five and thirty , in perfect health , well dressed , with the latest phones . I do n't understand what they 're doing chez moi . And I 'm afraid that they 're coming to prepare something .  <p> We left the town hall and , after a stop at the stamp museum , dropped by a clothing boutique run by a woman named Fanny , who was from Benin . <p>  She 's the prettiest woman in Le Luc , after my wife ,  Verrelle said . <p>  The Mayor 's looking for a new place for me ,  Fanny said , explaining that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that she had been afraid of the F.N. , but said that Verrelle was  super .  <p> I asked if her admiration for him would translate into a vote for Le Pen . <p>  Frankly , no . She kind of freaks me out ,  she said .  But I never would have imagined that a Front National mayor would come into my shop .  <p> Verrelle seemed to be practicing a hyper-local version of d ? diabolisation , the strategy of  de-demonization  that Le Pen has pursued over the past few years in the hope of making the F.N. seem respectable . The Party has excommunicated a few of the most flagrantly intolerant members of its establishment , including , in 2014 , Jean-Marie Le Pen . It has courted groups that it has traditionally alienated , such as women , senior citizens , Jews , practicing Catholics , and gay people . Yet , every once in a while , Marine Le Pen lets a shocking comment fly . She insisted recently that France bore no blame for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly thirteen thousand Jews and sent them to concentration camps . The effect , if not de-demonizing , is destabilizing . Unsure what to make of the latest iteration of the F.N. , or simply disillusioned with its competitors , some people figure , Why not put it to the test ? <p> The day after my visit to Le Luc , Macron was hosting a rally in Toulon , a sunbaked port city less than an hour away . It was a dicey moment for his campaign . Earlier in the week , during a TV interview in Algeria , he had declared that colonialism was  a crime against humanity .  French people across the political spectrum had reacted to the remark with a level of offense that surprised me . Opinions tended to vary by age and race , the most indignant skewing whiter and older . The few dissenters I encountered said that they appreciated Macron 's willingness to take on a taboo subject .  France has never come to terms with its colonial history , and I share his sentiment that to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our past ,  Houmria Berrada , the thirty-three-year-old French-born daughter of Algerian butchers , told me . A partner in a consulting business and a Macron supporter , she praised  his desire to change the software of our society , to bring it into the twenty-first century , and to tap into the energy of the working-class neighborhoods .  <p> Toulon , like many southern cities , has a large population of pieds noirs , Europeans who lived in Algeria during French rule , many of whom returned to France after the country gained independence , in 1962 . They have traditionally formed one of the bases of support for the F.N. , much of whose early leadership came out of military circles . ( Jean-Marie Le Pen has long been dogged by allegations that he committed torture during the Algerian War . ) F.N. Party activists were determined not to let Macron 's appearance in the area pass without protest . The morning of the rally , I joined Aline Bertrand , an F.N. regional councillor , as she canvassed the city 's Saturday market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Party , the arch-articulate young woman who pits women 's rights against Muslim immigration . The exemplar of this trend is Marion Mar ? chal Le Pen , Marine 's twenty-seven-year-old niece and a member of Parliament from the neighboring Vaucluse , who has warned that the coastal cities of PACA are turning into  favelas .  Mar ? chal espouses an ultra-hard-line social conservatism , opposing abortion ( she claims that this is a feminist position ) and same-sex marriage , issues on which her aunt has been ambivalent . According to Bertrand , Toulon 's Muslim immigrants have driven secular , native-born women out of the center of the city .  Here you 'll have a problem if you leave a bar at midnight in shorts and a T-shirt ,  she said . <p> Bertrand was handing out leaflets that featured a head shot of Marine Le Pen , wearing a jacket -- in bleu marine , her signature color -- with a beaded collar . A late-middle-aged man and woman approached . They were worried about their pensions . <p>  Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government department that deals with immigration .  Someone who 's never paid into social security in France can get retirement .  <p>  People think Marine Le Pen is against immigrants ,  the woman , warming to the theme , said .  She 's not . It 's justice that we want .  <p>  It 's like when the refrigerator is full we give to our neighbors , but when the refrigerator is empty we give to our children . The refrigerator of France is empty ,  Bertrand said , and the couple trudged off , carrying bags filled with cauliflower and lettuce . <p> I wandered away and started talking to a woman wearing a quilted leather jacket and lots of mascara .  I adore Marine !  she said , identifying herself as Mich ? le . She was a French teacher and a pied noir . She had high hopes for the election , particularly after what had happened in America .  Bravo , bravo for Trump !  she said . She was unimpressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  She asked if I knew that he was  a Rothschild banker  ( Macron worked for the firm from 2008 to 2012 , earning around a million dollars a year ) , invoking a slur -- I heard it repeated over and over , and not just by F.N. supporters -- that seemed laser-targeted toward some primal place in the French imagination , where a fondness for conspiracy theory intersected with a suspicion of high finance .  Rothschild banker  suggested , without having to say it , that Jewish influence was at work , making it all the more irresistible for the Front National . Macron also spent four years as an inspector of finance -- a high-powered position in the French civil service -- but nobody was stuck on that . <p> The rally was scheduled for three o'clock at the Toulon Z ? nith , a concert hall . When I got there , around two-thirty , the front gates were locked and the police were n't letting anyone in . A couple of hundred protesters had surrounded the entrance , creating what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wished to attend would have to traverse . They were chanting ,  Macron , treason !  When a scuffle broke out , the police fired tear gas . Two protesters were arrested , a policeman was injured , and a journalist went to the hospital . <p> Inside , a Macron spokesman told me ,  We strongly believe that some people saw the mess , were hassled , and turned around .  The auditorium was conspicuously not full . Still , the atmosphere was upbeat , in keeping with Macron 's assertion that his campaign is the only  projet positif  -- the sole  for ,  rather than  against ,  on offer . Macron claims to be leading a  transpartisan  movement that is  neither of the left nor of the right .  He shares many of the traditional concerns of the left , but often prefers to meet them with capitalist solutions . He wants to cut corporate taxes , simplify labor laws , consolidate the retirement system , invest in education and vocational training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised Angela Merkel 's generous refugee policy , saying that it  saved the dignity of Europe .  Proud to be a fluent English speaker , he has even appealed to the technocratic , cosmopolitan sector of the American population that has despaired since Trump 's election . To American scientists , he has promised ,  From now on , from next May , you will have a new homeland -- France !  <p> There was popcorn for sale . Laurence Haim , a celebrated French reporter who quit journalism to join Macron 's campaign , told me that  change  and  hope  are En Marche ! ' s keywords . In its disciplined idealism , Macron 's campaign is self-consciously modelled on Obama 's 2008 operation , right down to the armies of fresh-faced volunteers in cool-looking T-shirts . ( They have even been going door-to-door , a new tactic in France . ) When I visited Macron 's headquarters , in Paris , I found a sign taped to the restroom wall that read ,  According to a very serious study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . One like takes you half a second . Ready for 80 likes ? !  <p> A Socialist member of Parliament who 'd defected to En Marche ! warmed up the crowd with a pilou pilou , a local rugby chant . Then the lights went down and a video , a sort of  We Did n't Start the Fire  in visual form , began playing on a big screen : contraceptive pill ; Simone Weil ; Berlin Wall ; gay brides ; Victor Hugo ; Gandhi ; Je suis Charlie ; libert ? , ? galit ? , fraternit ? . Macron walked in to  Closer ,  by the Norwegian electronic-music duo Lemaitre , and took the stage . <p>  You are brave because you 're here ,  he said .  While , at the entrance to this arena , there were those who did n't want to let you in .  The Front National wanted  to confine France to its fears ,  he said , nonetheless admonishing the crowd not to boo the opposition . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but implored those whom he had offended to  forgive me for having hurt you .  <p> Macron has conjured an extreme center that did n't exist before he identified it . He has a talent for balancing opposing ideals , sometimes to the extent of appearing disingenuous or oxymoronic . His economic program gives companies more leeway in firing workers , but it offers unemployed workers higher benefits . Meme-makers delight in his habit of saying  at the same time ,  which , in Toulon , he repeated twenty-two times in ninety minutes . Occasionally , his syntheses present new and even revelatory ways of seeing things .  Europe is also the place of our sovereignty ,  he told the crowd in a confident voice , managing , for a moment , to unite two concepts -- globalization and nationalism -- that had roiled politics worldwide for the better part of a year . <p> As Minister of the Economy , Macron sponsored an explosively unpopular labor reform , which the Hollande government had to push through using a technical maneuver . Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that Macron took it as a personal failure -- his biggest -- that he was n't able to corral the votes needed to pass the bill , and that his disillusionment at the gridlock  was the main reason he decided to launch his movement .  Macron has been accused of arrogance . He relishes confronting his detractors , once telling a man who criticized his expensive suit ,  The best way to get a suit is to work .  He gets flak for having come out of nowhere , for being  a hologram  or  a marketing concept ,  but his youth can be an asset , particularly when coupled with one of his strongest arguments -- that the world is undergoing an epochal , accelerated transformation . This theory neutralizes charges of overambition while positioning him as a man of his moment . It also justifies En Marche ! as part of a social evolution rather than a vanity project .  The world changes ,  Macron told the crowd , announcing the end of the old order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a finished taxonomy , as if political life were a frozen species , butterflies that had to be pinned to a wall .  <p> French voters say that economic issues ( employment , buying power , and retirement ) rank just above immigration as their most pressing concerns . At the beginning of April , I went to Hayange , a town in the Grand Est region , which has been known for iron manufacturing since the de Wendel family established a foundry there , in 1704 . Hayange , where unemployment is seventeen per cent , used to be a bastion of the left , but its political landscape is in flux . During the Presidential election of 2012 , Fran ? ois Hollande visited the ArcelorMittal steelworks , which towers over the town , and promised to keep it open . Twenty-nine per cent of the town 's residents voted for him in the first round ( their second choice , at twenty-seven per cent , was Marine Le Pen ) . Later that year , ArcelorMittal closed two blast furnaces , eliminating more than six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mayor . Engelmann , a thirty-seven-year-old vegetarian , started his career as a far-left activist but switched to the Front National in 2010 , to protest the candidacy , for regional office , of a woman who publicly wore a hijab . <p> Hayange , for the moment , still has a middle class . The marriage banns , posted on a bulletin board in the town hall , included those for an auto-body painter and a cashier , a zinc roofer and his stay-at-home fianc ? e , and an optician and a midwife . In a shoe store , two saleswomen told me that they remained undecided , but were leaning toward Le Pen .  I think everyone wants her to win , but they do n't want to vote for her ,  one woman said , depicting a Le Pen victory as a sort of forbidden fantasy of the collective unconscious . ( In the first round , thirty-three per cent of hayangeois ended up voting for Le Pen , with Macron drawing only nineteen per cent . ) A florist who was preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents were Italian immigrants and had been stalwarts of the left , but that he was considering voting for Le Pen . He dismissed Macron as  a smooth talker who proposes nothing .  His family , like many in Hayange , had jumped across the political spectrum in the space of a generation , skipping over the center entirely . <p> That evening , I travelled to Monswiller , a tiny village near the German border where Le Pen was speaking . Several dozen protesters were staked out across the street from the auditorium , whose windows were plastered with posters for accordion bands .  No , France Does n't Want to Take in Any More Racists ,  one of their posters read . They banged on pots and pans . <p> The hall was packed . Near where I was standing , a woman in Capri pants and a young man with a scorpion tattoo that went from his ankle to his knee were hanging on to a rail , hoping to get a better look .  Marine ! Marine !  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  My dear friends , I ca n't disguise my immense pleasure at being here , in this dear land of Alsace !  From there , she launched into an unremittingly dark oration , delineating the betrayals of the political classes (  Do n't forget that Fran ? ois Fillon was the first Prime Minister of the Fifth Republic to celebrate the opening of a mosque with a little girl of only six years old , veiled , by his side !  ) , the culture of permissiveness , the unfair tax system , the dearth of public services , the abandonment of single mothers . Her gruff , sarcastic delivery held the audience spellbound . She had clearly studied the smallest particulars of their predicament . <p>  Look at these large , merged regions ,  she said , veering into a denunciation of a plan by which the French government , in 2016 , had consolidated the country 's administrative regions .  I was a victim in the North ,  she said of the area she represents .  You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' imposed on you . Which does not represent anything , which has no history , no soul , no meaning , no coherence .  Her voice booming , she built up to the line that would command the biggest applause of the evening :  I am leading the revolution of proximity . . . . I will give you back Alsace !  <p>  On est chez nous !  the crowd chanted .  It 's our house !  <p> Not only was Le Pen talking about the  forgotten people of France ,  as she calls them ; she was meeting them on their turf . Her rejection of globalism went smaller than nationalism . She was subdividing the country into its narrowest possible parts and trying to conquer them one by one . In the event that Macron 's vision of France stretched to the outer ring of one of those diagrams of concentric circles that kids draw to represent their position in the universe , Le Pen 's was confined to its tight nucleus . Her inspiration is to link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  We are the owners of our country ,  she said in Monswiller .  We must have the keys to open the house of France , to open it halfway , to close the door .  <p> This time around , a Le Pen ascension comes not as a shock but as a troubling inevitability . Political leaders are not unanimous in the belief that , in the name of solidarity , they must endorse Macron . M ? lenchon , the far-left candidate , received twenty per cent of the vote in the first round ; his supporters , combined with Le Pen 's , constitute a forty-per-cent share of the electorate . Both reject Macron 's business-friendly economics and his affinity for Europe . In 2002 , M ? lenchon , then a Socialist minister , condemned Jean-Marie Le Pen , saying ,  You must not hesitate . Put on gloves if you want , or hold your nose , or whatever you want , but vote . Put Le Pen down as far as possible !  This time , he was coyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to an online poll to determine whether his followers supported voting Macron , voting blanc ( submitting a blank ballot ) , or abstaining . Fillon , the center-right candidate , threw his support behind Macron , but more than half of his voters are saying that they wo n't follow his advice . <p> Still , the math heavily favors Macron , whom polls , which were accurate in the first round , have put ahead by twenty points . By Nate Silver 's estimate , Le Pen  could beat her polls by as much as Trump and Brexit combined , and still lose to Macron .

To promote the sale , Profiles in History is exhibiting the manuscript in New York later this month , at the Questroyal Fine Art gallery , and was floating a claim from an A.A. historian , Dr. Ernest Kurtz :  Not only is this manuscript the most important nonfiction manuscript in all history -- I consider it right up there with the Magna Carta , because of the personal freedom it has provided so many millions of alcoholics .  <p> This seemed like bar talk , until one thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of copies , in dozens of languages , and has altered an untold number of lives , mostly , one assumes , for the better .

@@18209779 <p> little-known drug company announced modestly encouraging results for its experimental Alzheimer 's drug on Monday , a rare but still preliminary glimmer of hope in a field that has been battered by failure after failure . <p> A mid-stage study by a tiny company would n't usually attract much attention , but the results unveiled by Neurotrope BioScience have been eagerly anticipated because its drug -- derived from a bushy , hermaphroditic sea creature -- takes a novel approach . <p> Big pharma companies have poured billions into drugs that target the toxic molecules amyloid and tau , long seen as the causes of Alzheimer 's . Neurotrope instead took aim at the immediate cause of cognitive decline : destruction of brain synapses and neurons , the physical basis of memory and thought . By preserving neurons and creating new synapses , the team hoped not just to ward off memory loss but perhaps even to help a damaged brain recover , Dr. Daniel Alkon , the company 's president , said in an interview while the trial was underway . <p> advertisement <p> The Phase 2 clinical trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main goal of such a study is to test drug safety , this one also gathered data on how well patients did on a standard test of cognition , called the Severe Impairment Battery , which is used in dementia patients with such serious cognitive deficits they often struggle to answer questions such as ,  What is your name ?  and  What is the thing you drink coffee from ?  <p> Neurotrope enrolled 147 patients with an average age of 72 and moderately severe to severe Alzheimer 's . Some dropped out , so in the end , 33 got a high dose of the drug ( known as Bryostatin-1 ) , given intravenously every two weeks ; 38 got a low dose , also every two weeks ; and 42 got a placebo . <p> The patients who received all six low doses did the best ; their average improvement after the 12 weeks was 1.5 points on the 100-point cognitive test . Patients receiving a placebo ( most were also on standard Alzheimer 's drugs ) lost 1.1 points . <p> Investors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by just over 50 percent , to around $9 a share . <p> A 2.6-point edge over placebo may fall slightly short of what the Food and Drug Administration would require for approval of a new Alzheimer 's drug , said Dr. Sam Gandy , a neurologist and Alzheimer 's researcher at Mount Sinai School of Medicine who is not affiliated with Neurotrope . He said the FDA typically wants to see a net benefit of at least 3 or 4 points . A longer trial might show if Bryostatin-1 can deliver that ; if it indeed preserves and creates synapses , continued use might bring greater benefits , Alkon said . <p> Although it might seem odd that the lower dose produced greater benefit than the higher dose , that is consistent with what Alkon and his colleagues saw in mouse studies : Because of the way bryostatin acts to boost synapses , less is more , as higher quantities overwhelm neuronal circuits . <p> One possible red flag : The apparent gains in the low-dose group did not meet the threshold for statistical significance . That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were due to chance , rather than to the drug . <p> Neurotrope 's results have not been published in a scientific journal or presented at a medical meeting , so outside experts have not been able to evaluate that and other important details . <p> Another concern about the new study is its modest length . In three months , many people with Alzheimer 's deteriorate precipitously , so the fact that the group receiving Bryostatin-1 showed improvement could indeed be due to the drug . On the other hand , some patients might have maintained their status quo during that period even without it . <p> Also , 12 weeks  might not be long enough to see chronic side effects  that could emerge with long-term use of the drug , said Dr. Howard Fillit , executive director of the Alzheimer 's Drug Discovery Foundation . ( If it works , patients would likely have to take Bryostatin-1 for the rest of their lives . ) The main adverse event was diarrhea . <p> The study was unusual for including patients with advanced disease . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages of Alzheimer 's , before their brains have lost many synapses . It is also unusual for focusing not on amyloid levels but on loss of synapses . But synapse loss is tied much more closely to the severity of dementia than amyloid plaques and tau tangles are , said Dean Hartley , director of science initiatives at the Alzheimer 's Association . <p> Neurotrope 's approach uses bryostatin , derived from a moss-like creature named Bugula neritina . In lab animals and cells in dishes , Neurotrope found that its drug increased synapse-boosting molecules called protein kinase C epsilon . That has two effects : it protects neurons from being destroyed by amyloid molecules , and it helps preserve and create synapses . <p> Bryostatin-1 reversed brain damage in the mice and improved learning and memory . Intriguingly , that happened even when levels of amyloid remained high , suggesting that the compound preserved and created enough synapses in the hippocampus ( the brain region that forms new memories ) to restore cognitive function and enable synapses to hold their own against the amyloid assault . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two mechanisms of action ,  Hartley said .  It boosts enzymes that degrade amyloid and also increases synaptogenesis ,  the formation of synapses and therefore memories . The latter  adds to our portfolio of potential ways to treat Alzheimer 's .  <h> Sign up to The Readout : A guide to what 's new in biotech <p> Please enter a valid email address . <p> Scientists not involved in the study were cautiously optimistic about the results . <p> It was  not big enough or long enough to show with certainty whether or not this is an effective treatment ,  said Maria Carrillo , chief science officer of the Alzheimer 's Association . But  there was a trend towards improvement in memory , thinking and behavior ... in a population -- people with moderate to severe Alzheimer 's -- that has received little attention recently in drug development .  <p> Though the results are likely to stir excitement , many drugs that seem to be effective in small numbers of patients fail in large clinical trials . Neurotrope CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  but it is not clear if the company , which began trading on the Nasdaq this year , has the financial resources to mount one . <p> There are four FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer 's , which affects 5.5 million people in the US : donepezil ( sold as Aricept ) , galantamine ( Razadyne ) , rivastigmine ( Exelon ) , and memantine ( Namenda ) . But none is a cure , and none affects the destruction of neurons and synapses , which causes the disease 's memory loss and cognitive catastrophe . <p>  We do n't have anything that slows down or prevents the disease ,  Hartley said .

@@18209789 <h> 3 of the Worst Credit Score Myths <h> Do n't fall for these major misconceptions . <p> Your credit score can impact your ability to get approved for a mortgage , auto loan , or credit card , and the better your score , the more favorable a rate you 're likely to snag . Unfortunately , a large number of consumers are ill-informed when it comes to credit scores , and many wind up making critical errors as a result . Here are a few credit score myths that can really hurt you if you 're not careful . <h> 1 . The older you are , the more your credit score will go up <p> There are several factors that come together to determine your credit score , such as avoiding late payments and not using too much of your available credit at any given point in time . Your payment history is another factor that can influence your credit score for better or worse , which is why younger borrowers often have trouble getting credit . It stands to reason that a 22-year-old who 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a credit history as a 40-year-old who 's been doing so for almost two decades . <p> IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . <p> But while having an established credit history can help your credit score climb , this only works if your spending and payment habits stay consistent or improve over time . If , as you get older , you stop making your minimum credit card payments and start maxing out your various cards ' limits , you 're more likely than not to see your score take a major dip . <p> In fact , according to ValuePenguin , 30- to 39-year-olds have the highest percentage of low credit scores among all other age groups . Because 30-somethings are likely to carry student debt , wedding debt , and mortgage debt all at the same time , this particular finding certainly makes sense . But it also proves the point that being older in no way guarantees a better credit score . <h> 2 . It 's best to close out credit cards you do n't use regularly <p> Some people are quick to assume that having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in some cases , closing out an old credit card can actually work against you . <p> Remember that credit history we just talked about ? Holding onto the same card for , say , 10 years can cause your credit score to go up , but if you close that card , it could have the opposite effect . Not only that , but if you decide to close out a card with a higher limit , it could impact your credit utilization ratio , which is the percentage of available credit you 're actually using . <p> A credit utilization ratio of 30% or less can improve your credit score , while exceeding that 30% limit can hurt it . If you close a card with a higher limit , it could cause your credit utilization ratio to climb , even if you do n't spend a single dime extra . Unless you have a compelling reason to close an old card , such as the addition of a hefty annual fee , you 're better off keeping it tucked away in your wallet. <h> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea <p> You may have been led to believe that reviewing your credit report can hurt your score , but this could n't be further from the truth . Whenever you access your credit report , it 's considered a soft inquiry , which wo n't damage your score . Hard inquiries , on the other hand , which are those initiated by lenders , can lower your score , so it 's best not to apply for too many new accounts at the same time . But ignoring your credit report for fear that it 'll lower your score can actually impact you negatively in other ways . <p> In a recently released WalletHub study , 37% of Americans acknowledged that they have n't checked their credit reports in at least a year . What 's even worse is that 16% admit they 've never checked their credit reports at all . <p> If you do n't know where your credit stands , you ca n't take steps to improve it .

@@18209792 <p> Update : I realise some people prefer to listen instead of reading , so I have made a small podcast discussing , and referring to , the ideas and themes below . <p> Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) informs me that the advice to  sell in May , and go away  comes from the tradition of British merchant bankers - I presume in the 19th century - to leave London for the country side in May and come back on St Leger 's Day in September . I am partial to a good anecdote , but does it work ? In order to check , I ran a little study using the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1991 . The first chart below shows the returns you would have foregone by selling in May and waiting 35 weeks and 17 weeks , respectively , before buying back . I have included both mean and median returns , because the outliers can skew the former when your sample size is not large . The second chart shows the results of a strategy which shorts the S&amp;P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holds until year-end . <p> Selling in May and waiting until the end of the year to buy back clearly is a bad strategy . On average you would have watched the market run away with 5.3% , with an even higher median of 7.7% . If on the other hand you bought back after 17 weeks , the results are pretty much a wash ; you would n't have lost much ground . In order to evaluate whether this is a smart strategy , though , we need to consider volatility and drawdowns in the period where we were n't in the market . If , for example , the market tended to produce higher volatility and larger drawdowns over the summer , it would probably be a good strategy to hold a little bit of extra cash over that period . In addition , we should also check whether the performance after May is conditional on the performance in the first part of the year . Needless to say , I have n't had time to check all these factors . <p> The strategy depicted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question . And suddenly the results are slightly better . On average , shorting in May and getting long in the first week of October have produced a return of 3.5% , although the median is a more modest 0.9% . In addition , the standard deviation of 13.5% suggests that the Sharpe ratio of this strategy is not that good . On average , you might do o.k. with this strategy , but in the years where it goes wrong you get rodgered . <p> So , what 's the conclusion ? <p> Based on the analysis above , I would argue that it probably is n't worth it to bet the farm on the idea of selling in May . Sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . In case you think my analysis is bollox , though , I am happy to announce that Bloomberg 's trusty macro geek Cameron Crise also had a look at the  sell in May go away  meme . His methodology , I am happy to admit , is geekier and more intricate than mine . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , to some extent at least . Mr. Crise cautions that investors probably should step back in the short run , but also that they should step back in before the year is over . With some ruthless chopping of the note , the following summarises the message from Cameron 's analysis . <p> The results suggest caution for U.S. equity investors next month , with a forecast return of -1.3% . Since 1991 , there have been seven prior negative forecasts for May . The average return of those months has been -1.29% with a median of -0.91% . Four of the seven delivered negative returns . ( ... ) What about for the entirety of the May-October period ? The model is more sanguine , forecasting a return of 3.96% .  <p> ( ... ) <p> Whether investors choose to sell in May is , of course , their own choice . Based on this analysis , however , those who do may not wish to stay away the whole summer .  <p> So there you have it . Could this be a year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner ? <p> To reflate or not to reflate ? <p> I sympathise with portfolio and asset managers who currently feel frustrated . For many , every fibre in their bodies are telling them that they should reduce exposure to risk assets , but they also realise that this impulse has been a costly one in this bull market . Last week 's grand tax reform plan from Mr. Trump and his team crystallised this conundrum . If passed as presented it could provide a meaningful short-term boost to the economy and the financial market reflation narrative , but chances are high that it will be a dud . Earlier this year , I mused about possible economic scenarios during Mr. Trump 's presidency . They 're still relevant I think . <p> 1 ) Raging USD bull , higher global growth . In this scenario , Mr. Trump 's policy mix emphasises domestic fiscal stimulus , but a relatively benign clampdown on free trade if any at all . The Fed raises rates , but the U.S. economy continues to power ahead by sucking in savings from abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we all live happily ever after , at least for a while . <p> 2 ) Stronger USD offsets aggressive border adjustment tax . In this scenario , the border tax adjustment happens , but a stronger dollar offsets the impact on the U.S. trade deficit . The key changes in this scenario would be within the U.S. economy and the economies of its closest trading partners . <p> 3 ) Weaker USD with an aggressive border adjustment tax . In this scenario , Mr. Trump goes full retard on the border adjustment tax/free trade clampdown . The USD dollar depreciates because markets perceive it to be adverse to U.S. economic growth . Domestic inflation rises sharply , the U.S. economy slows and the trade deficit narrows . The rest of the world is pulled down with the U.S. economy and a global recession ensues . <p> We can talk about stock market valuations , credit spreads , and where we are in the business cycle to the cows come home . But markets often trade on what is in front of them and speculation over economic policies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy decisions - remain a key pivot for risk assets . In that context , the tax plan presented by Mr. Trump is  bullish ,  at least in spirit . In essence , it pushes us closer to option number 1 above . In classic Trump fashion the tax plan appears to include all the popular proposals , mainly in the form of significant tax cuts . But the border adjustment tax-supposed to be a key component to finance tax cuts as part of a larger domestic tax reform in the U.S.-has been left out . After all , the BAT is complicated and unpopular among many U.S. industries with powerful lobbies in Washington . Instead , the U.S. administration had deferred to one of the oldest tricks in the macroeconomic policy book ; they 're arguing that the tax cuts will pay for themselves via higher growth . This type of naive Laffer curve economics is unlikely to go down well in Congress , and we have to assume that it wo n't pass in the form that it was presented last week . <p> Markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to deliver that elusive +3% GDP growth , and the balance of the tax proposal provides support for the bulls . If Mr. Trump wants growth via tax cuts , but ca n't figure out how to finance that via a  revenue neutral  tax reform , he only has to look abroad . The Eurozone , Japan and emerging markets have plenty of excess savings ready to keep U.S. yield relatively low as the economy lets rip . Of course , that would mean a significantly wider U.S. current account deficit which brings us full circle on three scenarios above . <p> Surprised that surprises are rolling over ? <p> More generally in markets , one of the more interesting developments last week was that the U.S. macroeconomic surprise index finally gave up the ghost . Survey data have been soaring recently , but hard data have trailed . The advance Q1 GDP print confirmed the bad news , showing that the economy slowed significantly at the start of the year . This headline is worrying , but it is fairly easy for the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP growth has plunged in Q1 only to rebound strongly later in the year since the financial crisis . My boss , and U.S. economics geek , Ian Shepherdson reckons this persistent seasonal  misjudgement  is worth a full 1 percentage points of GDP . In addition , the Q1 number was plagued by a number of specific headwinds ; consumers ' spending was hit by a delay in tax refunds and warm weather , which depressed spending on utilities . Headline leading indicators are turning up , indicating that headline GDP growth will rebound . That said , the GDP headline does n't play well with the reflation-narrative , and equity bulls buying the idea of a break-out in U.S. GDP better hope the data picks up soon . The GDP data also will worry those who believe the Fed will hike several times this year , but not much Assuming the labour market data remains firm , the Fed is likely to stay on course , not least based on signs that fiscal policy is about to become much looser . <p> In the Eurozone and emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean-revert and I think investors have to assume that this trend is about to repeat itself over the next few months . The second chart below supports this argument by showing that momentum of the MSCI World has run ahead of the rise in my diffusion index of leading indicators . All this should mean weaker risk assets across the board , but this is far from certain . Markets love to rally on good news in the economy , and bad news only means an even slower path towards Fed normalisation , not to mention a lower probability of the ECB and the BOJ pulling back from QE/ZIRP . The latter , of course , eventually provides support for credit spreads and equities , preventing markets from falling too fast too far . <p> Investors also have to respect the idea of divergence between headline country/region indices and sectors . European equities , for example , have been in a strong and stable uptrend since the beginning of the year . And they are showing few signs of rolling over . I have warned that equity markets in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue with flows . The chart below shows that European equity inflows - measured with Vanguard 's ETFs - have just recently turned positive on a three-month basis following a long period of outflows . This would suggest that the rally in Europe will continue . The bullish trend was boosted last week following Mr. Macron 's victory in the first round of the French presidential elections . Whatever reservations you might have about absolute European equity valuations , it 's clear that the combination of relative attractiveness compared with the U.S. and the hope of a European reflation story currently are strong catalysts . This is especially the case because it could lift EZ financials , and if they have to  catch up  in full from their post-crisis underperformance the benchmark index will fly . <p> Amidst all the confusion , the key trend for me remains that the U.S. curve is flattening . I have persistently been making this point in the last few weeks , because it provides an important cautionary tale not to chase the reflation narrative too hard . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fed raises rates and the U.S. curve steepens , I will be forced to change my views on the reflation narrative . So far , though , that is not happening . The chart below shows the U.S. 2s5s , which has rolled over recently and my base case remains that if the Fed has to punch it , this spread will flatten significantly given where we are in the business cycle . <p> Portfolio notes <p> I have made a few minor adjustments in the portfolio recently and will update the tables soon . I have sold the position in easyJet ( OTCQX:ESYJY ) for a nice profit and added to a few of the other core positions . Earnings have been a mixed bag . Punters pushed up Syntel into the announcement and dumped it following weak guidance . It does appear that most of the bad news is priced in here , but price action remains volatile and directionless . I am carrying a loss here and probably should have sold last month to get the tax relief , but I did n't , so I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OTCPK:VEGPF ) , but my experience suggests these events usually are buying opportunities so I have added a bit . I have also added slightly to the soft commodity ETF to keep its weight in the portfolio constant . In the EM department , markets appear excited about the LatAm retailer Falabella , but not so much Cencosud , which suggests that I am on the wrong horse here . Elsewhere , though , I am noting a lot of bullish talk about Colombia among EM specialists . If followed up with action , it would benefit the position in CIB , Bancolombia , which is the biggest constituency in the main ETF GXG . The main good news in the last month came from the announcement that the small U.K. manufacturer of water desalination and membrane technology has entered the Chinese market . Modern Water secured the sale of technology to Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center Co , and also , as far as I can see , managed to lock in a post-sale services agreement . That news pushed up the stock by almost 50% , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  I have also jumped into the shark-infested waters of U.S. retail via a small punt on Urban Outfitters ( NASDAQ:URBN ) . It has no debt and if it continues to do more or less what it has been doing in the past decade , it is cheap . If the Amazon singularity happens , though , who knows what will happen 1 . Finally , I will also be adding slightly to my short in Spooz ( OTC:SPZI ) that I have been carrying for a month . After all , I am a sucker for a good clich ? . <p> -- <p> 1 - And yes , I know about the  pizza ,  and I actually think it is a pretty good idea to diversify this way . But let 's just be clear that this will not be a salvation in the short run .

Security Council members at the White House . He said she was doing a  fantastic job .  ( AFP/Getty Images ) <p> Almost from the moment U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley took the stage at a recent women 's conference in liberal Manhattan , jeers and boos erupted . <p> Haley flashed the crowd a smile , sitting with her hands folded in her lap . She had come straight from the U.N. , where she had spoken emotionally about the poison gas attack in Syria that killed scores of civilians , the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America leading ,  she said ,  is what we are trying to do .  <p> MSNBC anchor Greta Van Susteren pressed Haley on the multiple investigations into whether President Trump 's current or former aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign . <p> As Haley tried to answer , a heckler interrupted ,  What about refugees ? ' ' <p> It was the kind of crossfire that Haley , 45 , has faced repeatedly since she resigned in January as a widely respected governor of South Carolina to join Trump 's team . Since then , she has become a high-profile voice on U.S. foreign policy , at times eclipsing Trump 's taciturn secretary of State , Rex Tillerson . <p> Haley 's nomination had been a surprise and not only because she had no diplomatic experience : She had endorsed Trump 's rivals during the GOP primaries last year , and he tweeted in response that she had  embarrassed  her state . <p> Haley already had been on the short list of rising GOP stars with a possible national future . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep her in the public eye , for better or worse , in the Trump administration . <p> Unlike some of her predecessors at the U.N. , Haley often displays a down-home charm that reveals her Southern upbringing , peppering her comments with  gonnas  and  wannas .  <p>  And what we 're gon na say is it 's just not gon na work ,  she told CBS News when asked about North Korea 's threats about using military force . <p> As a diplomat , however , Haley has been as contrarian as the president she represents . <p> In her debut speech at the U.N. , she warned allies and rivals that they would  see a change in the way we do business .  <p>  For those who do n't have our back ,  she added ,  we 're taking names .  <p> But she also has voiced more concern for human rights abuses than the White House , penning a column that said ignoring the issue leads to  a vicious cycle of violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least politely correct , the president . <p> A day after Trump seemed to jettison decades of U.S. policy and dismiss the possibility of a future Palestinian state , for example , Haley said at the U.N . that the administration  absolutely  supported a two-state solution with an independent Palestinian nation . <p> Her relations with Trump are difficult to read . <p> On April 24 , three weeks after the Manhattan event , Haley sat at the president 's side at an ornate table in the White House with ambassadors representing the 14 other nations in the U.N . Security Council . <p> Trump initially scolded the ambassadors for diplomatic failures in North Korea and Syria , and branded the U.N . an  underperformer .  He then turned toward Haley , who sat beside him . <p>  Does everybody like Nikki ?  he asked his guests .

The U.N . ambassador must explain U.S. policy to the world , but also keep an eye on reactions -- and politics -- in Washington . <p> On Friday , Haley definitely took the back seat when Tillerson made his debut speech to foreign ministers at the U.N .

As the child of legal immigrants , she called for greater enforcement of immigration laws , a position that put her in sync with Trump . <p> Haley 's response to the 2015 church massacre of black worshipers by a self-declared white supremacist put her in the national spotlight . As the state mourned , she deftly arranged the gradual removal of Confederate flags from state property , a still-sensitive issue for the state that fired the first shots of the Civil War . <p>  She is a very gifted politician ,  said Jaime Harrison , chairman of the state Democratic Party , who noted that Haley had refused to commit to removing the flags when demands came up during her 2014 reelection race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the World conference in Manhattan , where Trump clearly was not popular .

@@18209821 <h> Grayson Allen lives with consequences of his actions -- Jacobs <p> There 's no question Grayson Allen transgressed by tripping opponents in three separate instances , most recently last December against Elon . Mike Krzyzewski benched the junior for one game , a loss at Virginia Tech . He stripped Allen of the team captaincy he shared with Amile Jefferson and Matt Jones , a notable rebuke within a program built on veterans imparting communal values . The coach doubtless also privately emphasized the simple lesson he publicly professed in preseason regarding player behavior :  You 're not just an individual , you 're part of a group .  <p> Throughout the season , opposing fans booed , razzed and belittled Allen , who played with injuries to a foot , ankle and finger . More measured criticisms were freely offered about his unsafe and unsportsmanlike shenanigans . Allen 's name and visage gained an unsavory connotation , to the point a Florida company sold apparel mocking his propensity for putting his worst foot forward . On the court Allen 's every action was scrutinized for chippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual fever pitch . The guard 's playing time , starts , shot production , shooting accuracy and scoring -- virtually every stat except his turnovers and fouls -- fell from the previous year . <p> Still , it 's a bit of a stretch to think Allen deserves solitary confinement , the punishment he 's more or less subject to just now . <p> Allen 's singular isolation is a matter of oddest circumstance . He is the only certain holdover among the top eight scorers from the ' 17 Blue Devils squad . It 's difficult to believe that outcome , however temporary , is one he envisioned when he announced he would return for the 2017-18 season . <p> Seniors Jones and Jefferson will leave with degrees . All-ACC sophomore Luke Kennard and freshmen Harry Giles and Jayson Tatum are among 10 ACC players who declared their NBA intentions ; by absurd NCAA rule , when they sign with agents , as planned , their remaining NCAA eligibility will be forfeited . Sophomore Chase Jeter announced he 's transferring . Freshman Frank Johnson , like nine other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pro stock , leaving the door open to return later this spring . <p> That leaves Allen , who simply by standing still moved to the fore of a group of backups and incoming freshmen .  The last few weeks have provided the opportunity for a lot of reflection and prayer ,  the Floridian said in a mid-April statement released as Duke 's roster dominoes began to fall .  I 'm a firm believer that when something feels right , you go with it . The chance to play with next year 's team just felt right . I 'm completely focused on helping Coach K and our staff lead this team to a special season . I love being a Duke student , and continuing to be part of the university culture is something I do n't take for granted .  <h> Children pulled from overturned car in dramatic water rescue <h> Share Video <p> Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski talks with reporters following the Duke-Elon game in which Grayson Allen was called for tripping an Elon player . <p> Chuck **28;1181;TOOLONG <p> Given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leadership role could be overwhelming , marking a cautionary end to a promising career . Or it could be stabilizing , keeping Allen firmly grounded . What 's clear is that any personal challenge Allen faces will be less about what he does than about how he does it . <p> Allen 's status has changed quickly before . He was little-seen for much of his freshman year , only to emerge at a crucial moment as Duke subdued Wisconsin in the 2015 NCAA title game . He blossomed as a sophomore , leading the Devils in scoring , 3-pointers , assists and steals en route to All-ACC recognition . That rise so impressed observers , Allen was tabbed the league 's 2017 preseason Player of the Year . Then came his fall . <p> Now opportunity yawns at Duke , allowing Allen to return to the prominence that earned him Player of the Year consideration in the first place . Certainly he 's capable of elevating his performance to that level again . <p> There 's no possibility POY recognition will be offered at the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 preseason picks for the ACC 's best player , including one tie , came from Duke or North Carolina . ( UNC 's Joel Berry II is likely to make it 15 of 20 come autumn . ) <p> Allen might have a better chance of being chosen Player of the Year if , at season 's start , he 's not projected to be the league 's top performer . Since 2000 , just four of 18 preseason selections for ACC Player of the Year went on to win the award : Duke 's Shane Battier in 2001 , when he shared final honors with UNC 's Joseph Forte ; Duke 's J.J. Redick in 2006 ; UNC 's Tyler Hansbrough in 2008 ; and Virginia 's Malcolm Brogdon in 2016 . Prognosticators had Brogdon tied with Carolina 's Marcus Paige as the leading candidates in preseason . <p> Depending on how you look at it , this lack of acuity in forecasting demonstrates how uninformed media members are ; how readily sports voters go with known quantities ; how hard it is to make predictions ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four . <h> Children pulled from overturned car in dramatic water rescue <h> Share Video <p> Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski defends his handling of Grayson Allen following the game with Elon where Allen tripped an Elon player . Krzyzewski was talking to reporters after the game . <p> Chuck **28;1211;TOOLONG <p> Another reason Allen is unlikely to regain the honors foreseen for him prior to last season : Only one preseason Player of the Year candidate since 2000 won the award a season after he was expected to get it , and failed . Hansbrough was forecast to command the honor in 2007 only to see it go to Boston College 's Jared Dudley . Hansbrough was picked again prior to the 2008 season and did live up to advance billing . Projected a third time to win the award , he was eclipsed in 2009 by teammate Ty Lawson . <p> Two others , UNC 's Marcus Paige and Duke 's Kyle Singler , were predicted twice each to win ACC POY honors , and struck out both times . Paige fell short in 2015 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the award . Paige was surpassed again in 2016 when Brodgon won . Singler was expected to be the Player of the Year in 2010 . But the recognition went to Maryland 's flamboyant Greivis Vasquez , and in 2011 went to Nolan Smith , Singler 's teammate . <p> Since the century turned , only Hansbrough , Singler and Paige were predicted to become ACC Player of the Year multiple times . Combined , they were one for seven at making good on those forecasts . <p> Paige in 2016 and Allen last year are the only preseason POY picks since 2000 who did n't even finish the season as All-ACC selections . Three other preseason ACC Player of the Year choices did no better than make third team , the catch-all grouping for those who ought to get some recognition , but not too much -- Duke 's Chris Duhon in 2003 ; UNC 's Raymond Felton in 2004 ; and the Wolfpack 's C.J. Leslie in 2013 . <p> Allen , like Leslie , went from praised to pariah . He did not , however , quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succumb to the temptation to leave early while others around him  walked ,  as Krzyzewski put it . Instead the soft-spoken , three-time All-ACC Academic men 's basketball team member is poised to graduate , fulfilling what he 's described as a multigenerational family value . <p> Perhaps in truth Allen stayed merely because he was boxed in by his own actions on the court . The result , however , is that he has an opportunity for genuine basketball redemption , standing as the focal point in Durham with a team , a season and a legacy at his feet .

The 42-member FFA chapter was one of six from around the country that participated in a 45-minute town hall-style question and answer session with the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Students gathered in Hudson 's ag classroom dressed in their navy blue FFA jackets for the event through You Tube Live . <p> Purdue expressed optimism about the future of agriculture , tackled questions on trade disputes and talked about conservation efforts by farmers . With one questioner asking about a product that came before the USDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an answer . <p>  These are questions I 'm going to have to go and study on ,  said Purdue .

The Senate confirmed his appointment to the position April 24 . <p>  To me , it 's very humbling because we have very many , many strong FFA programs in the state of Iowa ,  said Dennis Deppe , Hudson 's FFA adviser and agriculture teacher . <p> When Hudson was first called on to ask a question , senior Maria Geisler , president of the FFA chapter , stood up . She pointed out that , for Iowa and surrounding states , the Mississippi River is an important part of the infrastructure to transport farm products around the U.S. and across the world . <p>  What would you do as the secretary of agriculture to improve the infrastructure in the United States ?  she asked . <p>  The president has proposed a very costly , very significant infrastructure program ,  responded Perdue .

President Trump on Sunday , March 26 , attacked conservative lawmakers for the failure of the Republican bill to replace Barack Obama 's health care law as his aides pledged to court moderate Democrats on upcoming initiatives from health care to tax cuts . ( AP Photo/Evan Vucci , File ) ( Credit : AP ) <p> Half the media plays it straight , according Trump a gravitas unsupported by facts or details . Others , from TV comedians to seasoned political columnists , can not . Whatever being presidential or serious governing is , they know that 's not Trump . <p> One hundred days in , what are we to make of this confusing mess ? So many conceits and balls are in the air . We know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super rich a trillion-dollar tax cut . Building the wall with Mexico . Reviving king coal . <p> America has become a new dystopia .

The latest spin from Establishment Republicans -- who abhor Trump -- is he is a bumbling but harmless fool . They believe they have his number -- he 's easily provoked , pushed , manipulated . In the end , all bark and no bite . <p>  Do n't get me wrong , I wish we had a president who had actual convictions and knowledge ,  wrote this GOP faction 's high priest , New York Times commentator David Brooks on Friday .  But it 's hard to maintain outrage at a man who is a political pond skater -- one of those little creatures that flit across the surface , sort of fascinating to watch , but have little effect as they go .  <p> Brooks ' portrayal of the lightweight-in-chief is the most optimistic assessment we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also as empty-headed as the 45th president . While Trump confesses the job is harder than he thought -- last week 's counterpoint to a multi-trillion tax cut for the already rich and signing decrees opening national monuments and continental shelves to industry -- one can only ask who 's in charge ? Who 's driving the colossal ship of state ? The federal government is super tanker that moves slowly but it still moves . <p> The answer seems to be whoever is best positioned to turn public power to their private advantage . It is a bit early to name those winners , as the current federal budget mostly predated Trump ( even if the Congress just had to seek new borrowing authority to get to the end of its 2017 fiscal year on September 30 ) . Whatever might be in the next budget is as blurry as Trump 's ever-changing mind ( Pull Obamacare subsidies , no do n't . Cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement , no do n't . Trash NATO , no wait ) . <p> The GOPs civil war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with eliminating nearly a trillion in health funding tied to Obamacare , add another layer of unpredictability to the fog hovering over the federal government . What 's unclear is who is running this circus . It may be no one . <p> Trump 's ascent appears to be morphing into an open invitation for Washington 's right-wing lifers to get back in the game and take another whack at the same lousy ideas they have been pedaling since Ronald Reagan 's presidency . That was Brook 's takeaway , which comforted him .  There 's nothing unusual ,  he said .  It looks like any Republican administration that is staffed by the same people whose prejudices were formed in 1984 and who have n't had a new thought since .  <p> Funny he mentions 1984 . What 's happening now has more in common with George Orwell 's novel of authoritarian excess and state overreach than the jolly days of Reagan . Twenty-first century reality has pressing issues , but they have no place in Trump 's world -- or on the desk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleash the dogs of carbon-burning capitalism or federal police bent on terrorizing immigrants . Creating a new energy economy , healing racial and class divisions , upholding dignity regardless of sexuality , respecting women and reproductive rights -- these concerns and their values have no place in the new dystopia . <p> The mainstream media is trained to respect elected officials and report on their actions in a dispassionate way , to let the public draw their conclusions and do something about it in the next election . But what 's going on is not normal . Few will say that . New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is an exception , noting that Trump 's tax plan -- a list of talking points -- was not a legislative blueprint .  Let 's not act as if that thing released on Wednesday , whatever it was , was something like say , the 2001 Bush tax cut ,  he wrote Friday .  Let 's not pretend we 're having a real discussion .  <p> What 's happening in political circles is not a discussion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's latest Obamacare repeal . The latest amendment from Speaker Paul Ryan allows states to pull the rug out from under the very sick .  We project that if states return to pre-ACA high risk pools in 2019 , high-risk pool premiums for people with pre-existing conditions could be as high as $25,700 annually ,  the AARP blog , Thinking Policy , said Thursday . That 's $25,700 before deductibles . <p> It goes further downhill . Republicans , from Trump to Ryan , are operating in deliberate bubbles . Ryan is n't talking to Senate Republicans . Nor apparently is he talking to health industry leaders . As Sister Carol Keehan , Catholic Health Association president , told the Los Angeles Times ,  To think you are going to revamp the entire American healthcare system without involving any of the people who actually deliver healthcare is insanity .  That assessment was n't unique .  They 're not interested in how health policy actually works ,  another executive told the LAT . Another said ,  It is totally divorced from reality .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this has become a real life dystopia . Part of this domestic fog is the stunning notion held by many of Trump 's working class supporters that he 's got their back . Really ? <p> In Pueblo , Colorado , a once-Democratic bastion , Trump supporters told the L.A. Times that he was being picked on by know-it-alls : the press , academics , coastal liberals and even Republicans in Congress . He must be doing something right if they 're all upset , they continued . The critics are not giving him a chance , they said , adding that they were optimistic that his tax cuts and promises to end government regulations will improve their livelihoods and revive their city 's shuttered factories . <p> The only thing that 's clear 100 days into Trump 's presidency is the country has entered a downward spiral where it 's unclear what factions or forces on the right will emerge with either political power , personal fortunes , or both .

@@18225092 <p> Any current or former Girl Scout can recall the first words of the group 's promise :  On my honor , I will try to serve God and my country .  <p> God , faith and spirituality have been ingrained in the backbone and history of the secular organization , whose badge-wearing , cookie-selling members are still going strong across the country . <p> For the better part of the past decade , however , the Catholic Church has eyed the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. suspiciously , claiming the organization is too close to groups such as Planned Parenthood that are in conflict with the faith 's views on abortion and the family . The Girl Scouts organization has denied the allegations , but the controversies -- largely rooted in misinformation -- have prompted dioceses to cut ties with the Scouts . <p> In the latest instance , the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas is ending its relationship with the Girl Scouts and transitioning its support to a Christian-based scouting group , saying the Girl Scouts ' programs and materials are  reflective of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the organization is  no longer a compatible partner in helping us form young women with the virtues and values of the Gospel .  <p> Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F.

As an alternative , the statement said , they should begin forming troops through American Heritage Girls , which describes itself as a  Christ-centered leadership and character development ministry  and promotes itself as a faith-based alternative to the secular Girl Scouts . <p> Some priests are allowing existing Girl Scout troops to continue meeting on church premises until their members graduate . Others have told their troop leaders they will have to start meeting elsewhere . Naumann also called for an end to Girl Scout cookie sales in the archdiocese , the Kansas City Star reported . <p>  No Girl Scout cookie sales should occur in Catholic Schools or on parish property after the 2016-2017 school year ,  he said in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Girl Scout troops across the archdiocese , which oversees dozens of Catholic churches and schools in 21 counties in northeast Kansas , was welcomed by some families who feel the American Heritage Girls ' faith-based approach aligns best with Catholicism . But it also prompted anger and frustration among many families who have seen generations of their children benefit from the program 's leadership-building , service-oriented mission . <p>  I just wish we could have coexisted ,  said Maria Walters , a former Girl Scout leader in the archdiocese and mother of two Girl Scouts , said in an interview with The Washington Post .  To take down a little girls organization when kids need to feel connected , need to feel important , is really sad to me .  <p> Since 2007 , the archdiocese leadership has been addressing concerns from some Girl Scout members and their mothers , who claimed that Girl Scout materials contradicted their Catholic beliefs , Naumann said . In the years that followed articles circulated on the Internet and criticism mounted over the group 's membership in the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which comprises 145 member organizations and is  closely tied to and celebrated by International Planned Parenthood ,  Naumann said . <p> Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. , Naumann wrote in his statement , contributes more than a million dollars a year to the membership organization , which advocates for women 's health legislation that specifically includes artificial contraception and abortion as a right of all women . <p> Girl Scout materials also frequently present Margret Sanger , founder of Planned Parenthood , and feminist pioneers Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem as role models , Naumann said , adding that these women  do not support a Catholic worldview .  <p> However , the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has repeatedly said it does not take a position or develop materials on issues regarding human sexuality , birth control and abortion , and that it does not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood . It compares its membership in WAGGGS to the United States ' relationship with the United Nations , saying it does not necessarily agree with every position the membership group takes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends to WAGGGS come solely from investment income . <p>  It 's hard for me to understand why we have to be responsible for something that 's happening in another country or across the world ,  Walters said .  To be looking at it so globally , it 's hard for me to wrap my head about it .  <p> Walters used to coordinate her parish 's Girl Scout troops , which usually amounted to about 100 girls , and have existed at the parish for at least 25 years . Troop leaders are no longer allowed to recruit in the church 's newsletter or post fliers on church grounds , though the parish 's priest is allowing current groups to continue meeting . <p>  Many leaders were very concerned and quite frankly angry about it ,  Walters said . She is particularly unsettled by the fact that the archdiocese has so far not taken such actions against the Boy Scouts of America . <p> She says her church 's Girl Scouts have led numerous food drives through the church , worked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered around the parish . It has also hosted a popular father-daughter dance . <p> Walters said the Girl Scouts ' network , which has 1.9 million girl members and 800,000 adult members nationwide , also provides valuable scholarships and opportunities for girls later in life . When her daughter , who is heading to college next year , mentioned her nine years of participation in the Girl Scouts to admissions counselors ,  that is something they recognize ,  Walters said . <p>  They recognize the leadership , the service , Walters said .  I 'm not sure what the reaction would be if I said American Heritage .  <p> Kansas City joins a growing list of archdioceses across the country that have taken measures against the Girl Scouts in their communities . The Archdiocese of St. Louis in February of last year published an advisory addressed to priests , followers and scout leaders , urging them to scale back ties with the Girl Scouts and to think twice about membership and even about buying their cookies . <p> In January 2012 , St. Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ousted 12 troops with 115 girls . Lawmakers in Indiana and Alaska have publicly berated the Girl Scouts . <p> Some parents began reporting that when their daughters went out to sell Girl Scout cookies , they had doors slammed in their faces by people refusing to make purchases because they think the profits go to support abortion and birth control . <p> About three years ago , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops began studying the issue . It said it held a lengthy dialogue with the Girl Scouts and developed a resource guide for Catholics , writing that the question of whether to host Girl Scouts must be answered at the local level . Diocesan bishops have the final authority over what is appropriate for Catholic scouting in their dioceses , it said . <p> American Heritage Girls has 1,005 troops and more than 47,000 members , claiming troops in every state in the country and some foreign countries .

The agreement provides an additional $15 billion in military spending , but that is only half what Trump had sought . <p> The White House budget director , Mick Mulvaney , argued Monday afternoon that Republicans scored some important wins in the budget deal . <p>  I saw how the Democrats thought they did a great job and how they think we did n't ,  he said .

But spending measures are one area where they can still exert considerable influence even while in the minority . <p> Democrats emerged from the spending talks with a respectable list of victories , including providing funds for Puerto Rico 's Medicaid program as well as for costs incurred by local law enforcement -- like the New York Police Department -- to protect Trump and his family . But even more significantly , the Democrats were able to push back on Trump . <p> Loser : Border wall builders <p> Few campaign promises have been as central and as polarizing as Trump 's oft-repeated vow to build a wall along the border with Mexico , which he insisted Mexico would pay for . <p> Trump had wanted money in the spending deal to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demand -- a crucial concession that helped smooth the path for congressional negotiators completing the spending deal . ( The agreement does include more funding for border security . ) <p> Trump insists he will build his wall , meaning that lawmakers are likely to face pressure to come up with funding . <p> Winner : Coal miners <p> A standoff over health care for retired coal miners raised the prospect of a government shutdown in December . Ultimately , Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , and other Democrats backed down , and the lights stayed on . <p> But Manchin and others vowed to continue their fight . The agreement reached by lawmakers includes a permanent extension of health benefits for retired miners who faced losing their health coverage , a victory for Manchin ; Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , the Senate majority leader ; and other lawmakers from coal states . <p> Winner : Planned Parenthood <p> Despite the desire of congressional Republicans to cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood , the spending package spares the organization .

Today , there is a new , far more grim one : witnessing a suicide . <p> Any suicide is tragic , but a suicide live-streamed on social media , to a potentially infinite audience , can be devastating . In addition to traumatizing witnesses , experts agree that it may also encourage others who are struggling to attempt it too . <p> Concerningly , the live-streamed suicides have been occurring with increasing frequency . Sadly , this parallels the growing number of suicides nationwide . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , suicide has escalated to the highest levels in almost 30 years . <p> Since live-streaming first debuted , there have been seven known cases of suicide , according to the executive director of Save.org .

Bandai Namco seems to have been taking notes , however , as the new trailer for vampire action-RPG Code Vein shows . The clip showcases Code Vein 's towering bosses and huge weapons , as well as a measured , tactical combat system that seems to rely more on dodges and timing than long strings of button combos . <p> While both games are set in gloomy worlds , Code Vein seems to borrow more from anime than the medieval-ish Dark Souls .

In a letter to readers , the publisher said he could no longer guarantee the safety of his staff . <p>  There are many places across the country where naming people convicted of drug trafficking or reporting on organized crime is off-limits , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reported ,  said Carlos Lauria , program director at the Committee to Protect Journalists . <p> In a country where journalists are being silenced , Zeta stands out for its bravery , said Alejandro Hope , a security expert in Mexico City . <p>  They have made it their mission to make narco violence and corruption visible ,  Hope said .  They have gone through hell and back , and somehow have survived .  <p> Along with exposing corruption , Zeta has chronicled a recent dramatic increase in violence in Mexico , which this year is on track to log more homicides than any year previously recorded . <p> The bloodshed has been particularly bad in Tijuana and the state of Baja California , where , according to federal statistics , 181 people were killed in March , twice as many as in March of last year . <p> While many Mexicans have grown weary of coverage of the 10-year drug war , Lara said he believes change will only occur if journalists continue to shine a light on the problem . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackle over the police scanner he keeps attached to his hip . <p> A man had been killed in Camino Verde , a poor hillside neighborhood crisscrossed with dirt roads and dense with concrete-block shacks . Martinez , a freelancer who frequently contributes to Zeta , sped to the scene in his battered white minivan , his bulletproof vest rattling in the truck . <p> Martinez starting taking photos as soon as he spotted the body of a man facedown on the ground , blood seeping from a gaping gunshot wound in the back of his head . <p> Next to the body was a handwritten sign :  The new ones do n't pardon .  It was was signed  Tijuana New Generation Cartel .  <p> In recent months , Martinez and his colleagues at Zeta have been documenting the rise of Tijuana 's newest criminal group -- an alliance formed between members of the Arellano Felix organization , which once held sway in Baja California , and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel , which is quickly becoming one of Mexico 's most powerful drug gangs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos of several alleged drug lords under the headline  The Jalisco Cartel 's Most Wanted ,  contradicting police claims that the Jalisco cartel did n't operate in Tijuana . That triggered yet another threat against the paper , this one from a Jalisco member known as  Goofy  who said he was going to shoot up Zeta 's headquarters . Once again , the state police were sent to stand guard outside the office . <p> To protect reporters , hard-hitting stories are often published under the byline  Zeta investigations ,  rather than the writer 's name . The windows in the newspaper 's headquarters , in an elegant home in one of Tijuana 's nicest residential neighborhoods , are made of bulletproof glass . <p> When the newspaper receives a threat , it immediately publishes the details , the idea being that the more people who are aware a crime may be committed , the less likely it is to happen . Then they alert the Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders and Journalists , a government program established in 2012 that provides emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic button that summons authorities . <p> There are 174 journalists protected under the program , the majority of whom have been threatened by government authorities . <p> But funding for the program is due to run out in a few months , and Mexico 's federal legislators have not earmarked more money to continue it . Human rights advocates complain that public officials do n't want to strengthen protections for journalists because a free and transparent press often is n't in their best interest . <p>  There is no political will to tackle this problem because what journalists investigate and report on is uncomfortable for many public functionaries ,  said Luis Knapp , an attorney at Article 19 . Fewer than 1% of crimes against journalists are ever solved , Knapp said . And a federal office formed to prosecute crimes against free speech has convicted suspects in just two cases over the last six years . <p> It is outrage over that impunity that fuels Adela Navarro , Zeta 's general director , who on a recent afternoon smoked a cigarette while waiting for her reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Each week , Zeta publishes a full-page editorial featuring a photo of Hector  El Gato  Felix , a Zeta editor known for his biting criticism of members of Mexico 's elites , including Jorge Hank Rhon , the owner of a Tijuana racetrack . <p> In 1988 , a man pulled up next to Felix while he was driving and opened fire , killing him . Two of Rhon 's bodyguards were convicted of the attack , but Rhon was never prosecuted . <p> The editorial addresses Rhon , as well as the current and former governors of Baja California :  Will your government capture the one who ordered this crime ?  it asks . <p> In 1997 , Zeta 's legendary founder , Jesus Blancornelas , was badly wounded and his bodyguard killed in a botched assassination attempt . Afterward , Blancornelas had a brick wall built in front of his home , and employed 14 bodyguards . <p> Eight years later , Francisco Ortiz Franco , who frequently wrote about drug trafficking for Zeta , was shot and killed while driving his children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justice . <p>  This means that one can silence , kill or extort a journalist and never see justice ,  said Navarro , who won the Committee to Protect Journalists ' International Press Freedom Award in 2007 , like Blancornelas before her . <p> Navarro is sometimes frustrated that Zeta 's stories do n't have a bigger impact . Corrupt public officials hold on to power . Drug cartels continue their bloody wars . <p> But she knows her work is doing something . When Zeta publishes the names and faces of cartel members , many flee Tijuana . <p> Navarro says she runs her newsroom with a mantra coined by Blancornelas , who died in 2006 of complications from stomach cancer . <p>  Be far from the government ,  he used to say ,  and close to the people .

( Los Angeles Times ) <p> Charlotte Allen <p> I 've lost count of the articles I 've read about Hulu 's adaptation of Margaret Atwood 's 1985 novel  The Handmaid 's Tale  that used the word  timely .  Timely , that is , in the sense of the presidency of Donald Trump . Here 's just a short list of print and online outlets where the T-word appears in connection with the re-creation of Atwood 's fictional America turned into a grim theocracy called Gilead that treats women like breeding cattle : the Hollywood Reporter , the Washington Post , the Guardian , Mother Jones , Harper 's Bazaar , the Daily Beast , Bustle , NPR , and CNN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles Times ' Patt Morrison :  We 're no longer making fiction -- we 're making a documentary .  <p> The idea , in these mostly liberal media outlets , seems to be that under President Trump , America has become -- or will become terrifyingly soon -- a militant Bible-based patriarchy ( hello Texas , hello Mike Pence ) in which women have no rights , especially no reproductive rights , and are divided into rigidly stratified social classes whose very names give their status away : privileged , churchy Wives at the top , Econowives in the lower social orders , and cook-and-bottle-washer Marthas who do the housework for the Wives and their powerful husbands , the Commanders . <p> At the very bottom are Handmaids , political pariahs ( wrong ideas , such as feminism ) who become the literal property of the top-dog men and are forced to bear their children . ( The Wives suffer from environmental pollution-related fertility problems . ) As the New Republic 's Sarah Jones , one of the  timely  crowd , explains ,  Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Handmaids , Econowives , and Wives ; we call them ' the help , ' ' surrogates , ' the working class , and the one percent .  <p> There is definitely a class of female pariahs on whom the elites heap condescension and contempt ... They 're called Deplorables . <p> At first I scoffed . There could n't be any more unlikely a theocrat than Trump , what with his misquotes from the Bible and speculation that he has n't been in a church more than twice since the inauguration . But then I realized that the liberal paranoiacs were right . Except not in the way they think . Instead of seeing Atwood 's fictional Gilead as a near-future militant fundamentalist Christian elite dystopia , we should see it as the mostly secularist elite dystopia we live in right now . <p> Take those elite-class Wives . Liberals typically assume the 1% consists of striped-pants tycoons off the Monopoly board who reliably vote Republican and want to cram retrograde religious ideas down people 's throats . In fact , as social scientists ( Charles Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Barone , writing recently for the Capital Research Center ) have observed , it 's the Democratic Party that 's the party of the 1% : the tech and finance billionaires , the media and entertainment moguls who cluster in expensive ZIP Codes around metropolitan Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York and Washington . <p> Those folks are n't known for their church-going , and they vote in favor of liberal social and economic causes from abortion and immigration rights to sustainable energy to higher taxes . They contribute heavily to political campaign , and with their upper-middle-class epigones they run the culture , deciding who gets banned on Twitter , which kinds of  diversity  are allowed on campuses , and what television programs we 'll be allowed to see . Today 's overclass Wives typically hold Ivy League degrees ,  lean in  to high-status careers , and stand with Planned Parenthood . <p> We also have a rigidly defined caste of Marthas ( and  Marthos ,  their male counterparts ) , because the Wives and their high-earning husbands need them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mow their lawns and trim their trees , all for bargain-basement wages . And so we have the irony of Malibu declaring itself a sanctuary city out of  solidarity  with its servant class , many of whom are in the country illegally , who ca n't afford to live anywhere near their wealthy and high-minded masters and mistresses . <p> Finally , the Handmaids . As in the fictional Gilead , real-life elite-class Wives have something of a fertility problem , although it 's related not to environmental degradation but delayed marriages and childbearing attempts of women who pursue high-power careers . Thanks to 30 years of advances in egg-transfer technology since Atwood published her novel , today 's gestational surrogates do n't have to get into embarrassing  threesome  sexual positions with the Commanders and their Wives in order to do their jobs . And they tend to be drawn not from the ranks of political dissidents , but from the financially strapped Econowife class ( military bases are common surrogate-recruiting centers ) who are willing to put up with a year 's worth of uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they receive . <p> Still , as in Gilead , there is definitely a class of female pariahs on whom the elites heap condescension , contempt and , when they can , punishment for holding views at variance with what the elites deem correct . They 're not called Handmaids , of course . They 're called Deplorables . Try telling the other people in your book club that you sent a check to the Donald 's campaign . Or , if you need a misogyny fix , search for the phrase  women who voted for Trump  on Twitter . Read up on what they 're saying about Kellyanne Conway at Jezebel . Or Ann Coulter just about anywhere . Those ugly white bonnets the Handmaids of Gilead are required to wear in the Hulu miniseries look downright benign by comparison . <p> Yes ,  The Handmaid 's Tale  is a documentary , all right . It just does n't happen to be the documentary that the liberals think it is . <p> Washington-based Charlotte Allen writes about social and cultural issues .

@@18226778 <p> ATLANTA -- There is plenty of blame to go around . The Mets need to finally address the way they deal with injuries and Noah Syndergaard has a responsibility to keep himself healthy , even if that means unnecessary tests , for his teammates , too . <p> There will be plenty of time to re-evaluate for both team and pitcher . Syndergaard was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a partially torn right lat muscle Monday , though even Sandy Alderson admitted there is little chance the righthander will be back soon .  I do n't think this period is going to be measured in days , think it 's going to be measured in weeks ,  the Mets GM said .  It 's going to be a considerable amount of time .  <p> According to Dr. Leesa Galatz , chair of the orthopedics department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , the usual recovery time for these injuries is  three to four months .  <p>  There is a period of rest , followed by progressive strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday afternoon .

The Mets lefty felt the issue during his start July 5 at Dodger Stadium and he did not pitch again until Sept. 6 . <p> So there will be plenty to rehash how this injury was handled or mishandled , but that wo n't change the fact the Mets now have to try to keep their hopes for the 2017 season alive with a decimated roster and rotation . <p> Monday night , Robert Gsellman continued to struggle , giving up five runs on six hits , in the Mets ' 7-5 win over the Braves at the new SunTrust Park .

I think we have to be realistic about what may be out there . As I said before there are some pitchers may be available who have not been pitching , would require a certain amount of time to ramp up and may not be available to us until about the time Matz and ( Seth ) Lugo are possibly back , but there may be some other possibilities . <p> Remember Zack Wheeler is on an innings limit that wo n't get him through the entire season and the bullpen has already proven to be inconsistent .

18237262," After she delivered her infant son in 2006 , Darline Turner relished those early hours in her Austin hospital room , changing diapers and playing with her son 's fingers and toes . <p> Everything was going smoothly until her nurse walked in , carrying a binder on subsidized social services like Medicaid and the state 's Women , Infant and Children program . Turner , a black woman who at the time was a physician assistant and doula , married and insured , listened to the nurse explain those services for 10 minutes before asking if all new moms got this information -- or just her . <p>  Her face went purple ,  Turner said .  Her assumption was I was a single mother who was going to need social services .  <p> Turner points to that incident as just one reason that Texas ' Task Force on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity needs to study how race , bias , prejudice and socio-economics affect access and care for pregnant black women . Some of that research would happen under Rep. Shawn Thierry 's House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Public Health Committee on Tuesday evening . <p> The nurse  did n't even read my chart ,  said Turner , who had a history of pregnancy complications , including two miscarriages and delivering her two children by C-section . <p>  Those are the things that we have to address ,  she added .  Because if a person , whether they 're conscious of it or not , has that implicit bias , then that 's coming into their treatment plan .  <p> While the maternal health of black mothers has been studied nationally for years , researchers and advocates have been baffled by recent reports showing black women in Texas are twice as likely to die after a pregnancy-related hospital stay than any other group of women . <p> Though black women accounted for only 11 percent of all Texas births in 2012 , they made up 29 percent of maternal deaths , according to a July 2016 report from the state 's Task Force on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity . White women accounted for 35 percent of births and 38 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing 48 percent of births but only 31 percent of maternal deaths . <p> The task force , created by the Legislature in 2013 , found that between 2011 and 2012 , 189 Texas mothers died less than a year after their pregnancy ended -- mostly from heart disease , drug overdoses and high blood pressure . And the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology reported in August 2016 that Texas ' maternal mortality rates had nearly doubled between 2010 and 2014 . <p> Despite the dire data , getting more legislators to focus on deaths among mothers -- particularly black women -- has been a challenge for advocates this session <p>  Who is going to listen to us talk about black women ?  That 's the question Marsha Jones , executive director for The Afiya Center , a Dallas-based group that focuses on reproductive health access for black women , said she and her staff asked themselves before the 2017 legislative session began . <p> Jones said the alarming rate of black mothers dying does n't  sit as heavily  as it should with non-blacks and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connects to the larger issue of black women being left out of conversations around reproductive justice . <p>  If people were more aware of this , the legislators would have to do something , and even our white allies would have to move their gauge a little bit more ,  Jones said .  They ca n't be concerned about access to abortion while not making sure black women are able to have their babies without dying .  <p> Under Thierry 's bill , the state 's Task Force on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity would study health-related factors for black mothers , including heart disease , eclampsia , high blood pressure , obesity and stress . The task force would also look at how socioeconomic status effects black mothers .

He said researchers need to talk to the black community and reach out to local groups to better understand the social issues affecting maternal public health . <p>  Addressing health is local ,  Jones said .  You may have a national solution , but until you adopt and modify it for the local area , it 's probably not going to work .  <p> Sen. Borris Miles , D-Houston , said the black women dying during and after childbirth  speak for themselves .

@@18243033 <h> What Will Democrats Demand Of Their 2020 Nominee ? <h> And will he be white and male ? <p> In this week 's politics chat , we take stock of how the Democratic Party has changed since President Trump won the White House . The transcript below has been lightly edited . <p> micah ( Micah Cohen , politics editor ) : What do Democrats want ? There 's been a ton of attention on the Trump administration revolving around his first 100 days , but we 've also learned a bit about what the Democratic Party will look like in the Trump era . Ron Brownstein at The Atlantic did a nice job of summarizing the issue : <p> Though Trump 's agenda has unified Democrats in near-term opposition , clear fault lines have quickly emerged about the party 's long-term strategy to regain power . On one side are those -- largely affiliated with Senator Bernie Sanders -- arguing for a biting message of economic populism , which is intended largely to recapture working-class white voters that stampeded to Trump in 2016 . On the other are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic message , aimed primarily at reassuring white-collar suburbanites drawn to the party mostly around cultural issues . <p> So , which wing is ascendant ? And how has that changed in the last few years and since Trump was elected ? <p> micah : Yeah , that 's better . Are there new litmus tests ? Or , what are the litmus tests ? <p> perry ( Perry Bacon Jr. , senior writer ) : I read a piece asking if the Democratic candidate in 2020 needed to be in favor of single payer . That may be a good clarifying question . <p> micah : What do people think ? <p> perry : Bernie Sanders is for that , of course . I saw Cory Booker asked about that recently and he gave a somewhat meandering answer . ( His office told Vox that  Medicare for all is one of those ideas that must be considered .  <p> natesilver ( Nate Silver , editor in chief ) : If I had to guess , I 'd think the 2020 nominee might support some type of supercharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare for anyone who wants it . <p> harry ( Harry Enten , senior political writer ) : He has as much of a shot as Donald Trump had of winning the Republican nomination at this point . ? ? <p> natesilver : Yeah , there are some candidates I have trouble seeing a constituency for . Booker . Andrew Cuomo . But ya never know . <p> clare.malone : Booker is a no . <p> harry : There will likely be room to run to the left on health care in 2020 , but it 's not clear how far to the left . <p> perry : Just help me understand , on the Booker thing . <p> Who is more Barack Obama-like than Booker ? Why is he such a bad candidate ? <p> clare.malone : Booker got tons of campaign cash from Wall Street . That 's a whole line of attack ads right there . <p> micah : What Clare said . Obama was more of an  outsider  and was n't connected to Wall Street at the hip . <p> clare.malone : Booker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but I think he comes across as less authentic than Obama . <p> micah : What are some other good clarifying litmus tests ? <p> natesilver : A $15 minimum wage ? <p> perry : I think if a Mark Warner-style candidate gets in , maybe he opposes that . But yes , a $15 minimum wage feels like a litmus test that the winner will have to pass . <p> natesilver : I 'm interested in the minimum wage , in part , because by the time we get to 2020 , we 'll actually have quite a bit of data on how well the much higher minimum wages that some states and cities have implemented are working . <p>  Hillary believes the minimum wage should be a living wage , and she will work to get to a $15 minimum wage over time , with appropriate variations for regions with a higher cost of living .  <p> perry : The platform had $15 . So it may be hard to back away from that . Unless the data , as Nate said , showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic ... in 2016 , it was pretty clear that Democrats were not going to retake the House . So , to some extent , Clinton 's opinion on a $15 minimum wage was purely theoretical . By 2020 , they might have a chance at the House -- and the Senate -- which could change the incentives a bit when the policies you advocate for could actually become law . <p> harry : I do n't think platforms are that important , but it 's probably an issue you do n't want to be further right on than the rest of the field . The minimum wage is generally very popular , no matter the state . <p> natesilver : Yeah . The minimum wage is one of the most popular parts of the leftist economic platform . So it 's a pretty safe thing for centrist Democrats to throw out there as a bone to the left . <p> perry : There will be Black Lives Matter and immigration litmus tests . I do n't quite know the questions yet . <p> clare.malone : See , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do see that as a premier issue , but the people who voted for Trump often see it as an  anti-police  issue . <p> harry : If you want to win delegates in the South , you have to be seen as pro racial justice . I guess the question is what the focus will be , as Clare said . <p> perry : So BLM . I think this is where candidates matter . Booker , Kamala Harris -- if they run for president -- I assume ca n't be 100 percent pro BLM . I think a black candidate has to be somewhat more careful on those issues , although I could be wrong . I think all the other candidates will be pushed to be pretty 100 percent in line with BLM-style positions : greater scrutiny of cops , sharp language around racial inequality , speaking bluntly about police incidents where people of color are injured or killed . <p> It 's likely that some candidate who is not white will run . And their positioning on racial issues is likely different than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting for sure . <p> natesilver : Someone ought to mention here that Sanders had a real tough time picking up black voters . I ca n't speak to all the issues there , but there does seem to be some tension between the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and the African-American base . <p> clare.malone : I think that 's why Keith Ellison is out there so much , Nate . <p> perry : Booker , Harris , I just think that dynamic is part of the issue . The last two Democratic nominees won in part by overwhelmingly winning the black vote . <p> harry : One reason Sanders had trouble picking up black voters is because he ran down the Democratic Party brand . We 're talking so much about outsiders , but African-American Democrats are n't liberal as much as they are Democratic . <p> natesilver : Buy , sell or hold : There 's a 40 percent chance that the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2020 will be a heterosexual white man . <p> micah : Sell . <p> clare.malone : Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> micah : I guess I 'm selling the white , male , straight Democratic candidates currently in the 2020 pool , but buying the structural forces that will push in that direction ? <p> perry : Hold . I think there will be demand for a white heterosexual man . But the people who currently look like the strongest potential candidates are n't white , heterosexual men . ( Think Elizabeth Warren . ) <p> natesilver : Worth thinking about : It may be more politically palatable for a heterosexual white man to hold  radical  policy positions than someone who is n't those things . <p> perry : Yes , yes , what Nate said . Booker and Harris ca n't run around talking about socialism . Neither could Obama . <p> micah : Perry , stop being nice . Nate was just repeating what you had already said . <p> clare.malone : Guys ( heh ) , never underestimate the institutional preference for a straight , white man . <p> That 's all I 'm saying in general here . <p> micah : That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : There was a piece last week about how Theo Epstein was the second coming , for God 's sake . <p> He saved baseball , he could save America ! <p> micah : Haha . <p> perry : lol . <p> micah : Back to BLM ... <p> I have no idea if this was true , but I always got the feeling that the Sanders campaign had polling showing that his supporters , who were overwhelmingly white , would be turned off by a more direct stance on racial justice . He certainly behaved that way . <p> And that could be a problem for a populist Democratic candidate in 2020 . Racial vs. economic justice is often falsely portrayed as an either/or , but maybe there is some tension there ? <p> perry : Hmm , Sanders had white supporters . But he had older , rural people and young , urban people . I think the latter are fine with racial stuff , though maybe the former are n't . <p> natesilver : Micah , are you asking what percent of the Democratic base is racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 and found that about 20 percent of white Democrats exhibited significant degrees of anti-black racism . <p> That number may have fallen a tick because some of those voters have left the Democratic Party since then . <p> perry : But Sanders lost . If I 'm trying to win the Democratic primary , I would first try to figure out if I could win 1 . the upper-income white liberals who want to be perceived as progressive on racial issues , 2. blacks , 3 . Latinos . <p> clare.malone : I think you 're just trying to win college-educated whites . I agree with the other two . <p> natesilver : With Democrats using a proportional allocation method for delegates -- and with fewer superdelegates in 2020 than in 2016 -- you could wind up with a pretty high risk of a BrOkErEd CoNvEnTiOn if you have tons of candidates running . <p> micah : Oh god . <p> natesilver : ? ? <p> natesilver : NATE SILVER PREDICTS 2020 BROKERED CONVENTION <p> harry : I believe the correct term is  contested convention .  Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests . Obviously the Democratic nominee in 2020 will be pro-choice , but let 's tackle the  Could they campaign for a pro-life Democrat ?  question . <p> perry : Maybe I 'm overly fixated on identity , but I think Elizabeth Warren can campaign for a pro-life candidate . I think Biden , a Catholic , can . I would not recommend that anyone else do that . <p> Sanders did it , and that is in part why I doubt he will be the Democratic presidential nominee , even if he runs in 2020 . <p> clare.malone : Hmmm . I du n no ! I think that 's the interesting open question . ( Open in Clare Malone 's world , at least . ) <p> harry : Why would any Democratic candidate do that ? What 's the upside to saying they would campaign with a pro-life Democrat ? <p> micah : The House , Harry ? <p> perry : Also , to show you 're a big-tent party , which I think Biden believes . <p> clare.malone : <p> harry : I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah , the point is that the more prerequisites the party puts in place for the Democratic nominee , the smaller the tent . <p> micah : Oh , but Harry makes a fair point . <p> harry : I totally get why Democrats should be willing to campaign for pro-life candidates . But , per a February Quinnipiac poll , just 10 percent of Democrats said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases . Hence , the momentum within the party is clearly not on the anti-abortion side . <p> natesilver : Yeah , opinions on abortion have become a lot more partisan over the long run . Back in the 1970s -- right after Roe v. Wade -- it really was n't a partisan issue at all ( there was almost no split between Democratic and GOP opinion on it ) . <p> clare.malone : But I do n't think it makes you a bad pol to take a chance on the other side . It does mean you 're a risk-taker , because institutions ( like the Democratic Party ) often take a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things is that Democrats feel like they 've  won  the culture wars , and so there 's no longer a trade-off between taking left-wing positions on cultural issues and electability . And the other is that there 's been something of a revival of left-wing economic positions since the financial crisis . Plus , you 've had more partisan sorting take place overall . <p> clare.malone : Do Democrats feel like they 've won ? I would say a lot of women are pointing out that you 've got an uphill battle with choice stuff still . See : the last abortion clinic in Kentucky perhaps closing as just one example . <p> micah : That war has definitely not been won . <p> harry : Democrats have won the culture war when it comes to same-sex marriage . <p> Abortion is a whole other question . <p> natesilver : I think gay marriage and gay rights loom pretty large in the Democratic mindset , yeah . <p> perry : One more big litmus test we did n't hit : Can you be a former Democratic president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . <p> clare.malone : OMG , why did Obama take that fee ? <p> micah : Or , to make it more general : Is n't a certain distance from Wall Street and banks a new litmus test ? <p> clare.malone : That is a new NO-NO for the populist Democratic Party . Like , actually , why did he ? <p> micah : Obama ? <p> clare.malone : The Obamas ' book advance is reportedly something like $65 million . <p> micah : ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> natesilver : ? ? ? ? <p> micah : He 's not running for anything ? <p> clare.malone : Yeah , but $400K is a relative drop in the bucket with that book deal . <p> harry : To be fair , I 'd stop drinking diet soda for a year for $65 million . Maybe for a month for $400K . <p> natesilver : Maybe he 's like ,  Fuck these fuckers , I was president for eight years and made incredible sacrifices for the job and now I 'm a private citizen .  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active ex-president , once an acceptable amount of time has passed ( who the hell knows what that amount of time is ) . <p> micah : But if you 're advising Joe Biden and he comes to you and says  Hey , Wells Fargo is offering me $75,000 to come speak at some corporate retreat ,  you freak out , yes ? <p> perry : So I think there are more litmus tests , to answer Clare 's question . I think you have to be 1 . more populist , like being for some kind of super-public option on health care , 2. pretty strongly pro-choice in almost every way , 3. pretty supportive of BLM views . But . But . I thought you would need to be pro-immigration to win the GOP nomination in 2016 and certainly the presidency . So readers , if you got this far , ignore everything I 've said . <p> harry : We have n't said it because perhaps it 's obvious : I think you 're going to need to be very anti-Trump . <p> natesilver : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up  chants begin at one of their rallies ? <p> clare.malone : Do what people used to do and address it head on as not something that 's acceptable or normal to do in a liberal democracy -- call for the jailing of your opponent . <p> natesilver : But what if Democrats want more of a brawler ? <p> clare.malone : Nate , you can be a brawler and not call for the jailing of your opponent . <p> Also , you do n't get locked up if you 're impeached . Let 's be precise . <p> harry : One thing we 'll have to see is how popular Trump is come 2019 . <p> natesilver : I 'm just trying to roll things forward here . It seems to all of us like there may be a lot of litmus tests that the serious 2020 candidates need to pass . And there are probably also going to be a lot of candidates . <p> So if that 's the case , temperament and personality might matter a lot . As well as  identity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be like 2008 when Clinton , John Edwards and Obama did n't really have major policy differences but nonetheless had pretty clear and distinct constituencies . <p> Nate Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight. @natesilver538 <p> Harry Enten is a senior political writer and analyst for FiveThirtyEight. @forecasterenten <p> Clare Malone is a senior political writer for FiveThirtyEight. @ClareMalone

MIKE RUTLEDGE/STAFF <p> HAMILTON <p> The South Hamilton Crossing project , which city leaders hope will improve traffic flow between Ohio 4 , the Miami University Hamilton campus and Hamilton 's west side , is ahead of schedule . <p> It 's so ahead of schedule at this point , it is possible the roadway could be open by the end of this year , rather than the official target date of December 2018 . On the other hand , local officials probably will wait until the project is completely finished next spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project were to open this year , with just the base layer of asphalt , it probably would have to be shut down again in early 2018 to lay down the top layer of asphalt and make other finishing touches , said David Spinney , executive director of the Butler County Transportation Improvement District , which is managing the long-sought highway project . <p>  To be perfectly honest , the original construction schedule gave the contractor a lot of latitude , because we did n't know exactly when we were going to get started in the middle of the construction season ,  Spinney said .  So the actual contract completion date is December of 2018 .  <p>  Just to give you an idea where we are , that called for the actual steel fabrication to be done next spring ,  Spinney said .  It 's being done now .... We 're looking to have the majority of work done by the end of the year ( 2017 ) , if the weather cooperates .  <p> Even if the weather is good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done next year , such as the final course of asphalt and some concrete work . But the majority of the work we hope to have completed by the beginning of winter .  <p>  That 's a decision we 'll have to make ,  Spinney said .  We 're hoping to have most of the asphalt work done this year , and then the final top course next year . So I 'm reluctant to say we will or we wo n't have it open for traffic . Because one of the issues is if we open it up to traffic , we 'll have to close it again to do the work . So I 'll have to sit down and talk with the contractor , see where we are in November , and talk with the city , to see how we want to approach it .  <p> Hamilton Public Works Director Rich Engle , for his part , does n't consider it a good idea to open the new roadway , only to close it again . <p>  If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I would open it to begin with ,  said Engle , who noted many months are left before the work is finished :  Who knows what 's going to happen over the next nine months ?  <p>  We were hopeful that it would open earlier than December of 2018 , that 's for sure ,  Engle said . If only a base of asphalt has been laid down ,  I do n't think I 'd put traffic on it , at that point . I 'd wait until it 's all finished .  <p> The project 's construction will total about $18 million , but property purchases , roadway design and other costs put total price tag for South Hamilton Crossing in the upper-$20 millions , Spinney said . <p>  The contractor 's doing well , even though we 've had all this rain ,  Spinney said .  The significant amount of embankment work is proceeding quite well , and the utility work is moving along quite well , so we 're happy with that .  <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewers , storm-water , gas and electric -- involves city-of-Hamilton operations , although Cincinnati Bell fiber optics also are involved . <p>  The sooner the better , obviously ,  Engle said . <p>  It provides a second grade separation ( underpass or overpass ) over the CSX ( railroad ) tracks , which will make a significant difference ,  Spinney said .  Right now , people tend to head up to High Street because they know they can get through ( without being delayed by a train ) , but High Street becomes really congested , and this will provide a second access .  <p> Spinney added :  It also will extend Grand Boulevard all the way to University ( Boulevard ) , so it really opens that whole are up near University for more development , provides a better access to ( Vora Technology Park at 101 Knightsbridge Drive ) , as well as the ( Miami ) university campus .  <p> There 's some debate over how much the new highway will have on High Street traffic , Engle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's varying opinions on how much , but especially now , with the at-grade crossing closed at South Hamilton Crossing .  <p> Engle noted traffic to and from the city 's West Side will be able to use the Columbia Bridge , which connects Pershing Avenue with B Street and New London Road , and use South Hamilton Crossing to reach Ohio 4 and the Ohio 4 Bypass , avoiding High Street .

@@18247447 <h> The Future of Jobs and Jobs Training <p> As robots , automation and artificial intelligence perform more tasks and there is massive disruption of jobs , experts say a wider array of education and skills-building programs will be created to meet new demands . There are two uncertainties : Will well-prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools ? And will market capitalism survive ? <p> People will create the jobs of the future , not simply train for them , and technology is already central . It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead . Jonathan Grudin <p> Multiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices -- many of them smart , autonomous systems -- continue their march into workplaces . A recent study by labor economists found that  one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent .  When Pew Research Center and Elon University 's Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verdict was evenly split : 48% of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created , while 52% said more jobs would be created than lost . Since that expert canvassing , the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at **28;1012;TOOLONG . <p> Several policy and market-based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists . A key idea emerging from many conversations , including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 , is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future . Among the six overall findings in a new 184-page report from the National Academies of Sciences , the experts recommended :  The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market . At the same time , recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education .  <p> Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight : A 2016 Pew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  found that 87% of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace . This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above-average level of preparation ( including education , experience and job training ) ; average or above-average interpersonal , management and communication skills ; and higher levels of analytical skills , such as critical thinking and computer skills . <p> A central question about the future , then , is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future . Pew Research Center and Elon 's Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large-scale canvassing of technologists , scholars , practitioners , strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 , asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training . <p> Some 1,408 responded to the following question , sharing their expectations about what is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future ? <p> The nonscientific canvassing found that 70% of these particular respondents said  yes  -- such programs would emerge and be successful . A majority among the 30% who said  no  generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs . ( See  About this canvassing of experts  for further details about the limits of this sample . ) <p> Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider : <p> What are the most important skills needed to succeed in the workforce of the future ? <p> Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems -- especially those that are self-directed -- and other nontraditional settings ? <p> Which skills will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accepting of applicants who rely on new types of credentialing systems , or will they be viewed as less qualified than those who have attended traditional four-year and graduate programs ? <p> Several common expectations were evident in these respondents ' answers , no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills- and capabilities-training efforts . ( It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors , attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills . Although these aspects of psychology can not be classified as  skills  and perhaps can not be directly taught in any sort of training environment , we include these answers under the general heading of skills , capabilities and attributes . ) <p> A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem : Most of these experts expect the education marketplace -- especially online learning platforms -- to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs . Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers . Many foresee a significant number of self-teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings , some elements are offered online , some are created by for-profit firms , some are free , some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities , and a lot of real-time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own . <p> A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners . Accordingly , some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way . <p> A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machines seem unable to replicate : Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate , noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI . These respondents suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exploit creativity , collaborative activity , abstract and systems thinking , complex communication , and the ability to thrive in diverse environments . <p> One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk , a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas :  The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network , manage public relations , display intercultural sensitivity , marketing , and generally what author Dan Goleman would call ' social ' and ' emotional ' intelligence . This also includes creativity , and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box .  <p> Another example is the response of Fredric Litto , a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance-learning expert from the University of S ? o Paulo :  We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance , and moving in favor of such ' graduates ' who , in the workplace , demonstrate greater proactiveness , initiative , discipline , collaborativeness -- because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership , design thinking ,  human meta communication ,  deliberation , conflict resolution , and the capacity to motivate , mobilize and innovate . Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term -- to work with data and algorithms , to implement 3-D modeling and work with 3-D printers , or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality . Jonathan Grudin , principal researcher at Microsoft , commented ,  People will create the jobs of the future , not simply train for them , and technology is already central . It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead .  <p> Seriously ? You 're asking about the workforce of the future ? As if there 's going to be one ? Anonymous scientific editor <p> About a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 . Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts . For instance , Jason Hong , an associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale : political will and a proven technology platform . Even assuming that the political will ( and budget ) existed , there 's no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people . MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction . They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses . So in short , we can train small numbers of individuals ( tens of thousands ) per year using today 's community colleges and university systems , but probably not more .  <p> Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind . An anonymousscientific editor commented ,  Seriously ? You 're asking about the workforce of the future ? As if there 's going to be one ? ... ' Employers ' either run sweatshops abroad or hire people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hate , while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero-hour contracts . And the relatively ' job-secure ' qualified people who work in the ' professions ' are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff . The details of how they earn their credentials are n't going to be an issue .  <p> Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions , though they were allowed to respond anonymously . Their well-considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends . These findings do not represent all possible points of view , but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations . Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29-page section below and then expanded upon in more-detailed sections . Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length . <p> The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses , including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . <h> Theme 1 : The training ecosystem will evolve , with a mix of innovation in all education formats <p> These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn . They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines can not match and at helping humans partner with technology . They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real-time learning to workers , often in formats that are self-taught . <p> Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes . <h> More learning systems will migrate online . Some will be self-directed and some offered or required by employers ; others will be hybrid online/real-world classes . Workers will be expected to learn continuously <p> Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI/robotics revolution are going to spur the public , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adapted to deliver more flexible , open , adaptable , resilient , certifiable and useful lifelong learning . <p> Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future , and this generation will be no different.Justin Reich <p> Jim Hendler , a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , predicted ,  The nature of education will change to a mix of models . College education ( which will still favor multi-year , residential education ) will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners , followed by more online content , in situ training , and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world . As automation puts increasing numbers of low- and middle-skill workers out of work , these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector .  <p> Michael Wollowski , an associate professor of computer science at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology , commented ,  We will definitely see a vast increase in educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called on-demand or on-the-job kind of training programs . ( We kind of have to , as with continued automation , we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce . ) I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly ; it increases the overall education of their workforce , which benefits their bottom line . Nevertheless , I am a big believer in the college experience , which I see as a way to learn what you are all about , as a person and in your field of study . The confidence in your own self and your abilities can not be learned in a short course . It takes life experience , or four years at a tough college . At a good college , you are challenged to be your best -- this is very resource-intensive and can not be scaled at this time .  <p> Justin Reich , executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) Teaching Systems Lab , observed ,  Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no different . Our established systems of job training , primarily community colleges and state universities , will continue to play a crucial role , though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges .  <p> David Karger , a professor of computer science at MIT , wrote ,  Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks , but the future is very promising . ... No matter how good our online teaching systems become , the current four-year college model will remain dominant for quite some time . ... Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities , which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value . One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of ( less well paid ) teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online .  <p> A few respondents said already established institutions can not be as fully successful as new initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Today 's educational and training institutions are a shambles . They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world , and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale , they mostly fail . The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible . Within the decade , the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines , and we will see all sorts of new initiatives , mostly outside these schooling , academic and training institutions , which are mostly beyond repair . People will shift to them because they work , because they are far less expensive and because they are always available .  <p> Barry Chudakov , founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp. , says education has been liberated because , thanks to digital innovation , everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives . He wrote ,  The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls -- and so the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go up again . In the ( hopefully near ) future , we will not segregate schooling from work and real-world thinking and development . They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning , realization , exposure , hands-on experience and integration into students ' own lives . And , again , the experience of being a student , now confined to grade school , secondary school and university , will expand to include workers , those looking for work , and those who want or need to retrain -- as well as what we now think of as conventional education . One way we will break down these walls -- we are already doing so -- will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as ' places ' where learning happens . Via simulation , gaming , digital presentations -- combined with hands-on , real-world experience -- learning and re-education will move out of books and into the world . The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world -- again , breaking down the walls of the classroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade , writing ,  These programs have a cost , and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs .  More such arguments are included in later sections of this report . <h> Online courses will get a big boost from advances in augmented reality ( AR ) , virtual reality ( VR ) and artificial intelligence ( AI ) <p> Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options , saying online course options are cost-effective , evolving for the better , and game-changing because they are globally accessible . Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality ( AR ) , virtual reality ( VR ) and AI . While some say 2026 will still be  early days  for this tech , many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade . <p> Already , today there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not being implemented to their full potential . Edward Friedman <p> Edward Friedman , professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology , wrote ,  Already , today there are quite effective online training and education systems , but they are not being implemented to their full potential . These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade . Also , populations will be more tech-savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease . In addition , the development of virtual reality , AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems . There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost-effective manner .  <p> The president of a technology LLC wrote ,  Training , teaching are all going online , partly because of high costs of campus education .  <p> Richard Adler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  AI , voice-response , telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields .  <p> Ray Schroeder , associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois , Springfield , commented ,  It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers ( not just jobs ) over their lifetime . These career changes will require retooling , training and education . The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning ; they will learn online . I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as ' Jill Watson ' at Georgia Tech , the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students . I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real-time , three-dimensional augmented reality . These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes .  <p> Fredric Litto , an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance-learning expert from the University of S ? o Paulo , replied ,  There is no field of work that can not be learned , totally or in great part , in well-organized and administered online programs , either in traditional ' course ' formats , or in self-directed , independent learning opportunities , supplemented , when appropriate , by face-to-face , hands-on , practice situations .  <p> Tawny Schlieski , research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board , explained ,  New technologies of human/computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education . ... Augmented and virtual reality tools ... make learning more experiential , they engage students with physical movement , and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets . As these tools evolve over the next decade , the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development , which will roll into ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher learning .  <h> Universities still have special roles to play in preparing people for life , but some are likely to diversify and differentiate <p> Many respondents said real-world , campus-based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade . They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities ' capabilities for fully immersive , person-to-person learning , as well as mentoring and socializing functions , before 2026 . They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education , but they expect that job-specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches . Some say major universities ' core online course content , developed with all of the new-tech bells and whistles , will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales , where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in-person mentoring activities . <p> The most important skills to have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion , empathy , vulnerability and social-emotional intelligence.Frank Elavsky <p> Uta Russmann , **30;1042;TOOLONG professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna , Austria , said ,  In the future , more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills can not be trained in ' mass ' online programs . Traditional four-year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future , as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field , and here people learn how to approach new things , ask questions and find answers , deal with new situations , etc. -- all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life . Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job .  <p> Frank Elavsky , data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC , responded ,  The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts . ...

Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung ( self-cultivation ) and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people . But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as ... complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well .  <p> Dana Klisanin , psychologist/futurist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students ' access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed . ... Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions , and online institutions will increasingly offer meet-ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges .  <p> Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large-scale settings by 2026 ? Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes , anticipating that improvements in such education would continue . However , many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach , learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today . <h> Tough-to-teach intangible skills , capabilities and attributes such as emotional intelligence , curiosity , creativity , adaptability , resilience and critical thinking will be most highly valued <p> Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills , capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers ' lives in the next decade . <p> The skills needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity , creativity , taking initiative , multi-disciplinary thinking and empathy .

Tiffany Shlain <p> While coding and other  hard skills  were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting ,  soft ,   human  skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics . <p> Devin Fidler , research director at the Institute for the Future , predicted ,  As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities , uniquely human skills will become more valuable . There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value .  <p> Susan Price , a digital architect at Continuum Analytics , commented ,  Increasingly , machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans , such as computation , data analysis and logic .

I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale .  <p> Ben Shneiderman , professor of computer science at the University of Maryland , observed ,  Students can be trained to be more innovative , creative and active initiators of novel ideas . Skills of writing , speaking and making videos are important , but fundamental skills of critical thinking , community building , teamwork , deliberation/dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful . A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical .  <p> Louisa Heinrich , founder at Superhuman Limited , commented ,  Lateral and system-thinking skills are increasingly critical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be re-prioritised at all levels of education .  <p> An anonymous technologist commented ,  Programming and problem solving , learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important , and more and more workers will be replaced by software/hardware-based ' workers . ' Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce , and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class .  <p> Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U.S. to train more people in technical skills . An anonymous respondent commented ,  Teach a billion people to program and you 'll end up with 900,000,000 unemployed programmers .  <p> An anonymous program director for a major U.S. technology funding organization predicted ,  We will see training for the jobs of the past , and for service jobs . The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills -- most things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will also be able to train computers to do better .  <p> Among the many other skills mentioned were : process-oriented and system-oriented thinking ; journalistic skills , including research , evaluation of multiple sources , writing and speaking ; understanding algorithms , computational thinking , networking and programming ; grasping law and policy ; an evidence-based way of looking at the world ; time management ; conflict resolution ; decision-making ; locating information in the flood of data ; storytelling using data ; and influencing and consensus building . A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face-to-face interaction , including one who said they  seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop .  <p> Because so many intricacies of the workplace -- the human , soft and hard -- are learned on the job , respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st-century workplace . <p> D. Yvette Wohn , assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important .  <p> Ian O'Byrne , an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston , replied ,  In the future we 'll see more opportunities for online , personalized learning . This will include open , online learning experiences ( e.g. , MOOCs ) where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests . I also believe that we 'll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one-to-one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback . We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past . Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources . Through evolving technologies ( e.g. , blockchain ) , this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways .  <p> An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship . We 've seen again and again that the broader the audience focus , the less the course seems to deliver . As for what the skills of the future are , they 'll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty . You may get a degree in computer software development , but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for , say , the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you . The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things .  <p> As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems , many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers ' participation in training programs and the mastery of skills . Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app-based learning systems . <h> While the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers may accept alternate credentialing systems , as learning options and their measures evolve <p> Charlie Firestone , communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute , replied ,  There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies , e.g. , badging and similar techniques . Employers will accept these more as they prove probative . And online learning will be more prevalent , even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning . New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities . Despite all of these measures , the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program , at least in the short run .  <p> Sam Punnett , research officer at TableRock Media , wrote ,  I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems . Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines ( currently data science appears ' all the rage ' ) and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills . Traditional credentials will continue to hold value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidates perceived ability in ' learning how to learn . ' The four-year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience . ... Certificates are being viewed more favourably , and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working-world requirements .  <p> William J. Ward , a university communications professor , @DR4WARD , commented ,  Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce . Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills . People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four-year and graduate programs .  <h> The proof of competency may be in the real-world work portfolios <p> Many workplaces place a higher value on real-world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification , yet their hiring systems -- including AI bots programmed to scan resum ? s -- still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out widget makers who can make widgets all the same . They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions.Jeff Jarvis <p> A software engineering and system administration professional commented ,  The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned -- in some fields it 's considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little , and that a portfolio , references , and hands-on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate 's ability . The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required , as a way of screening candidates . Both of those cost a lot of money , and neither mean a lot for a candidate 's competence . I hope this will change ( both job listings and quality of degrees/certifications ) , but do n't see it happening soon .  <p> Meryl Krieger , career specialist at Indiana University , Bloomington 's Jacobs School , replied ,  Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum ? s -- resum ? s simply are too two-dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in essence , job reels -- that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker 's skills . I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria ; these will also incorporate an individual 's ability to communicate and work with teams ( huge in employer requests for new employees ) , which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats . Thus , the educational and training programs of the future will become ( in their best incarnations ) sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands-on training programs . The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements .  <p> Jeff Jarvis , a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism , wrote ,  Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same . They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions . They are built on an outmoded attention economy : Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should shift to competency-based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes , and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge .  <p> While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st-century jobs , a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons . Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system . The next themes and subthemes examine these responses . <h> Theme 4 : Training and learning systems will not meet 21st-century needs by 2026 <p> A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade . The 30% who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt , to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary . Interestingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities ; these respondents especially agree that it is important , and they say that our human institutions -- government , business , education -- are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down . Many of them say that current K-12 or K-16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets . <p> Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading : <p> It may not be possible to train workers for future skills , for many reasons , including that there will not be any jobs to train them for or that jobs change too quickly . <p> There is no  political will ,  nor is there evidence leaders will provide funding , for mass-scale improvement in training . Several observed that if education advances can not be monetized with the appropriate profit margin , they are not moved forward . <p> Many workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-directed sacrifices they must to adjust their skills . <p> The  soft  skills , capabilities and attitudes respondents assume will be necessary in future workers are difficult to teach en masse or at all , and they question how any teaching scheme can instill such sophisticated traits in large numbers of workers . <p> Some among the 70% of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above -- mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best . Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents . <h> Within the next decade , education systems will not be up to the task of adapting to train or retrain people for the skills likely to be most prized in the future <p> Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are ( i.e. , what do you want to be when you grow up ) rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world.Pamela Rutledge <p> Andrew Walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation , there will be no quantum leap in our ability to ' up-skill ' people . Learning takes time and practice , which means it requires money , lots of money , to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort .  <p> B. Remy Cross , assistant professor of sociology , Webster University , commented ,  Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system , it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand . As manufacturing and many labor-intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized , we will see a bulge in service jobs . These require good people skills , something that is often hard to train online .  <p> John Bell , software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College , replied ,  Even today , access to information is not the limiting factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities , a large-scale educational experience ( either MOOC or on-demand broadcasts ) will not be able to duplicate that .  <p> Stowe Boyd , managing director of Another Voice and a well-known thinker on work futures , discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems :  While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs ,  he observed ,  it 's unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future . Many of the ' skills ' that will be needed are more like personality characteristics , like curiosity , or social skills that require enculturation to take hold . Individual training -- like programming or learning how to cook -- may not be what will be needed . And employers may play less of a role , especially as AI- and bot-augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many , rather than ' a job . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' forty acres and a bot ' as a political campaign slogan of 2024 .  <p> Luis Miron , a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans , wrote ,  Bluntly speaking , I have little confidence in the educational sector , K-16 , having the capacity and vision to offer high-quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society . The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies -- culturally , religiously and politically .  <p> Pamela Rutledge , director of the Media Psychology Research Center , wrote ,  The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing . Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are ( i.e. , what do you want to be when you grow up ) rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world . We have traditional institutions invested in learning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-directed learners . This bias impacts the entire process , from educators to employers . It is changing , but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt . New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias . ... Successful education models will begin developing ' mixed methods ' to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice-relevant standards .  <p> Justin Reich , executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab , observed ,  There will continue to be for-profit actors in the sector , and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students , many others will be exploitative , with a greater focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities .  <h> Show me the money : Many doubts hinge upon lack of political will and necessary funding <p> John Paine , a business analyst , commented ,  The competing desires 1 ) to make educational activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context .  <p> danah boyd , founder of Data &amp; Society , commented ,  I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps . I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio-economic factors that are underpinning skill training . For example , companies wo n't pay for reskilling -- and we do n't have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling . Furthermore , we have serious geographic mismatches , underlying discriminatory attitudes , and limited opportunities for lower- to mid-level career advancement . What 's at stake are not simply skills gaps -- it 's about how we want to architect labor , benefits and social safety nets . And right now , we talk about needing to increase skills , but that 's not what employers care about . It just sounds nice . When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake is not skills training .  <h> Some people are incapable of or uninterested in self-directed learning <p> Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents ' eyes are the ability to adapt , or  pivot ,  and the motivation to up-skill as needed . Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self-motivated to keep learning . <p> My biggest concern with self-directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation . And I am not confident that individuals will find their way ... David Berstein <p> David Bernstein , a former research director , wrote ,  The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn . ... My biggest concern with self-directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation . And I am not confident that individuals will find their way , just as those who enter college today do n't know what they want to be when they grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still need some basic skills ( interpersonal communications , basic arithmetic , along with some general culture awareness ) so they can have that flexibility . ... Any 3-year-old can use their parent 's smartphone or tablet without reading the manual . What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 .  <p> Calton Pu , professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology , wrote ,  The most important skill is a meta-skill : the ability to adapt to changes . This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection . As the rate of technological innovation intensifies , the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets . The people who can adapt the best ( and fastest ) will win . This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors : precision agriculture , manufacturing 4.0 , precision medicine , just to name a few . Therefore , the challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adapt and learn new skills . Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen .  <p> Cory Salveson , learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US , responded ,  The nature of work today , and in future , is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well-paying jobs , they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives .  <p> Some of these experts say those who are n't motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind . <p> Scott Amyx , CEO of Amyx+ , said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve , but ,  The education system is at an inflection point . Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled , to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K-12 education . ... It 's those less-educated and less-skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement . Online mediums and self-directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor at Muhlenberg College , replied ,  Self-directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning . It is true that most online courses require self-direction . Indeed , when I advise students , I do n't recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self-direction . But in-person courses may also be self-directed . This works well for some students but not others . Students who are self-directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents . They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn . And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege . So , not only does the self-direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale , the fact that a high degree of self-direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large-scale programs .  <p> Among the 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets , killing more jobs than it creates . They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people 's sense of identity , the socio-economic divisions that already distress them , their ability to pay for basic needs , their ability to use the growing amount of  leisure time  constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems . It should also be noted that many among the 70% who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns . <h> There will be many millions more people and millions fewer jobs in the future <p> The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training -- it is one of diminishing jobs . How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant ? Jennifer Zickerman <p> Cory Doctorow , activist-in-residence at MIT Media Lab and co-owner of Boing Boing ( boingboing.net ) , responded ,  It 's an article of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run ) ; but this is a ' theory-free ' observation based on previous automation booms . The current automation is based on ' general purpose ' technologies -- machine learning , Turing complete computers , a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications -- and there 's good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive , and create fewer new jobs , than those that came before .  <p> Glenn Ricart , Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite , said ,  Up to the present time , automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion -- things that can and should improve the quality of people 's work lives . But in the next decade or two , there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education , health care , transportation , agriculture and public safety . What are the ' new jobs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts , why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future ?  <p> Richard Stallman , Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation , commented ,  I think this question has no answer . I think there wo n't be jobs for most people a few decades from now , and that 's what really matters . As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries , I think they will be difficult to teach . You could get better at them by practice , but you could n't study them much .  <p> Jennifer Zickerman , an entrepreneur , commented ,  The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training -- it is one of diminishing jobs . How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant ?  <h> Capitalism itself is in real trouble <p> The question is n't how to train people for nonexistent jobs , it 's how to share the wealth in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borenstein <p> Nathaniel Borenstein , chief scientist at Mimecast , replied ,  I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs . The ' jobs of the future ' are likely to be performed by robots . The question is n't how to train people for nonexistent jobs , it 's how to share the wealth in a world where we do n't need most people to work .  <p> Paul Davis , a director based in Australia , predicted ,  Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale , I question their overall effectiveness . Algorithms , automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda . Labor becomes , in many ways , surplus to economic requirements . This ... shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts ; labor 's bargaining position will be dramatically weakened . The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a ' Post Economic Growth ' model to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a systems architect , replied ,  The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology . By the time the training programs are widely available , the required skills will no longer be required . The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career-based approach . There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning .  <p> Tom Sommerville , agile coach , wrote ,  Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation . We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense . The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra-rich individuals is unsustainable . All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  <p> Some of these experts projected further out into the future , imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities . <p> Timothy C. Mack , managing principal at AAI Foresight , said ,  In the area of skill-building , the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social , creative and emotive skill sets .  <h> Responses from additional key experts regarding the future of jobs and jobs training <p> This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing . Following this wide-ranging set of comments on the topic , a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 . <h> ' There will be a parallel call for benefits , professional development and compensation that smooths out rough patches ' in an ' on-demand labor life ' <p> Baratunde Thurston , a director 's fellow at MIT Media Lab , Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion , replied ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations . Why go $100,000 in debt for a four-year university , when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end ? From the employer perspective , this type of learning will only grow . We are creating a system of on-demand labor akin to ' cloud-based labor ' where companies ' provision ' labor resources at will and release them at will , not by the year or month but by the job , labor unit , or small time unit , including minutes . The automation of human labor will grow significantly . And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers . This of course is a terrible , soulless , insecure life for the workers , but since when did that really change anything ? There will also be a parallel call for benefits , professional development , and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on-demand labor life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human-scale responses of accountability and responsibility . To quote Donald Trump , ' Sad ! '  <h> We will see much more personalized , adaptive forms of education <p> Doc Searls , journalist , speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University 's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society , wrote ,  I do n't expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require ' new educational and training programs . ' Instead , I expect we 'll see much more adaptive forms of education , especially of the self-made kind . Look at Linux and open-source development . The world runs on both now , and they employ millions of human beings . Many , or most , of the new open-source programmers building and running our world today are self-taught , or teach each other , to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling . Look at Khan Academy and the home-schooling movement , both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's proven capability . This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions . ( By the way , I do n't like the term ' job . ' It demeans work , and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart . ) The great educator John Taylor Gatto , who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements , says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse . We are by nature learning animals . We are each also very different : both from each other and from who we were yesterday . As a society we need to take advantage of that , and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity , a fundamental balancing feature of all nature , human and otherwise .  <h> ' We will likely see a radical economic disruption in education , using new tools and means ' <p> Jeff Jarvis , professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism , wrote ,  At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago , I heard this economic goal presented : We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education , allowing change to occur outside the tax-based ( and thus safe ) confines of public education . I do n't think we 'll ever reach zero ; MOOCs are not the solution ! But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education -- using new tools and means to learn and certify learning -- and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills .  <h> The current education system is perpetuating the shortage of talent <p> Cory Doctorow , activist-in-residence at MIT Media Lab and co-owner of Boing Boing ( boingboing.net ) , responded ,  There is , for the immediate and medium term , a huge shortage of IT talent , of course -- especially security researchers and professionals . In part , this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to becoming security researchers . If a kid today hacks her school 's censoring firewall to look at a blocked site , she is expelled ( and possibly arrested ) , not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class . We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding ' algorithms ' ( which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models ) . An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy -- which can readily be taught using current affairs , for example , analyzing the poll numbers from elections , the claims made by climate change scientists , or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case -- would impart skills that transferred well into IT , programming and , especially , security .  <h> The most important skill at the moment of the ' Cambrian Explosion of robotics ' is adaptability <p> Amy Webb , futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute , commented ,  Gill Pratt , a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500,000 years ago , Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion -- a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today . We are clearly in the dawn of a new age , one that is marked not just by advanced machines but , rather , machines that are starting to learn how to think . Soon , those machines that can think will augment humankind , helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential . Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation . That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional ( bank tellers , drivers , mortgage brokers ) . However , there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines : doctors , journalists , teachers . The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability . This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems , our interfaces , our code . Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens , who can find information quickly , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone . If there are unanticipated external events -- environmental disasters , new pandemics and the like -- that could devastate a country 's economy and significantly impact its workforce , which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities .  <h> A lot of knowledge can be imparted by machines and does n't require ' human interaction ' <p> Mike Roberts , Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , responded ,  MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy , so ' yes , ' there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what does n't work . These developments are contributing to a crisis of self-confidence in higher ed , where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts , including the basic definition of ' education . ' Human brains are complex , and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues . Generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills -- induction , deduction , probability , etc. -- to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior . The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction . We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage -- half or more -- can be gained through self-study using computer-assisted techniques . The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self-interest , ignorance , flawed economics , etc . If one believes in ' the singularity , ' it does n't matter , because human-machine symbiosis will bury the problem !  <h> ' What should people know to be informed participants in a democracy ? ' <p>  A lot has been written about the need for STEM science , technology , engineering and mathematics education . Here I want to focus on other areas.1 ) Teaching and Healing : As computers , robots and other machines take over many jobs , we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly , coach . The issue is not just training but cultural re-evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills . While technology can assist with this work , we must n't lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves.2 ) Craft and Repair : For the benefit of both the individual and the environment , we need to strongly support learning design , craft , building , repair . Few of us make anything we use -- from the building we live in to the objects we own -- and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible , to be easily bought , discarded , and bought again , in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness . Education here should be integrated into everyday life , not just for when one is ' in school . ' E.g. , much rental housing is in bad repair , with tenants waiting weeks , months , years for even simple fixes -- a running toilet , broken lights , a hole in a wall . Very easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making it economically rewarding , in the case of a common good ) -- is a simple , basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable . Some of this can be taught online -- a key component is also online coordination.3 ) An Informed Citizen : What should people know , what skills should they have , to be informed participants in a democracy ? Certainly science and technology are important , but we need to refocus liberal education , not ignore it . History , in all its complexity . Critical thinking -- how to debate , how to recognize persuasive techniques , how to understand multiple perspectives , how to mediate between different viewpoints . Key skill : how to research , how to evaluate what you see and read .  <h> ' Learning in private is selfish . Public learning is becoming the norm . ' <p> David Weinberger , a senior researcher at Harvard University 's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society , said ,  Judging from what we 're seeing happening now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innovative platforms will be peer-to-peer . Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish . Public learning is becoming the norm .  <h> Most of the focus will be on childhood education for the world <p> Brad Templeton , chair for computing at Singularity University , wrote ,  We will see the start of these technologies , but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years . Instead , most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world . The most important skill , flexibility , wo n't be taught easily this way , but must become a focus of K-12 education .  <h> Look at what MOOCs have done already <p> John Markoff , former senior writer at The New York Times , said ,  We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs , and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge . Udacity is a good example of the trajectory . Sebastian Thrun was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company to pursue the idea , he pivoted , focusing specifically on skill-oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market .  <h> The internet fosters innovation <p> Vint Cerf , vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member , noted ,  The internet can support remote training and learning . These need not be MOOCs . Even mobiles can be sources of education . I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge .  <h> The main teaching goal : ' We will make you better than a robot . We let you cooperate with robots . ' <p> Marcel Bullinga , trend watcher and keynote speaker @futurecheck , replied ,  The future is cheap , and so is the future of education . I saw an ad already for $1,000 bachelor's-level training -- with an app , of course . Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog/human-first to digital/mobile/AI-first . New online credential systems will first complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future ? Those are the skills a robot can not master ( yet ) . Leadership , design , human meta communication , critical thinking , motivating , cooperating , innovating . In my black-and-white moments I say : Skip all knowledge training in high schools . Main teaching goal : ' We enable you to survive in an ever-changing world with ever-changing skills and not-yet-existing jobs of the future . We make you better than a robot . We let you cooperate with robots . We build your self-trust . We turn you into a decent , polite , social person . And most importantly , we do not mix education with religion -- never . '  <p> Anil Dash , entrepreneur , technologist , and advocate @AnilDash , predicted ,  These credentials will start to become widespread , but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs .  <h> The most essential deep learning will not come from online systems <p> Henning Schulzrinne , Internet Hall of Fame member and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had the problem that short-duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills ( ' learn how to operate the new industry-specific tool X in a week ' ) to the existing repertoire . The subject-matter-specific part of a B.S. degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years , often more , and these are high-intensity , full-time years , often without other responsibilities such as family , mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy . A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice , including group work , internships and other high-intensity , high-interaction apprentice-like programs . It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their ' adult ' responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents . There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers , e.g. , the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . The MOOC-style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this ' delta ' learning for practicing professionals , not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate .  <h> We may soon be at the point where ' adaptive algorithms learn jobs faster than humans ' <p> Jamais Cascio , distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future , responded ,  We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs , but for the most part they 're likely to fall victim to two related problems . 1 ) The difficulty of projecting what will be the ' jobs of the future ' in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster . Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation ( see , for example , filmmaking ) ; new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees . 2 ) We 're in an era of general-purpose computing , which means that our systems are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Automation and semi-automation ( e.g. , self-checkout stands ) do n't need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers . As learning systems improve , we will soon ( if we 're not already ) be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans .  <h> ' Very unlikely ' that a new training regime will be successful <p> Kate Crawford , a well-known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies , wrote ,  We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market . But to make it ' successful , ' in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs , is very unlikely .  <h> New information flows will require new ways to think about education and learning <p> Paul Jones , clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina , replied ,  We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past . Training is useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . As for sipping : you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears . Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us . So far , training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda.com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills . No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow . Wikipedia has n't destroyed bar trivia , but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise . Who played guitar lead on  All or Nothing  ? No need for debate . A little information sip will let us know . We 're fine and informed -- but not educated or learned . But what is left out ? Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas , deeper investigation into known areas , and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge . This is our challenge : how to create wisdom from knowledge , not just jobs from training and information .  <h> ' We need to think about co-evolving work and workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented ,  This is a nuanced question . We trained generations of people to be ' phone operators ' by making it easy to operate the phone ( aka , dialing ) . Today programming is increasingly become a trade . The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C-level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software . And that 's even more true for policymakers . We need to think about co-evolving work and workers . And , as always , critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge .  <h> Beware the model of for-profit learning <p> Frank Pasquale , author of  The Black Box Society : The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information  and professor of law at the University of Maryland , said :  The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism . Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn . Skills training all too often does not . Of course , it can complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations . But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement , not less . We need to invest in higher education , shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges , lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite , leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs . Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges -- but can not replace them . Online-only programs emphasize the upside of high-tech approaches , but rarely grapple with the downside . Big-data surveillance will track the work students do , ostensibly in order to customize learning . Get stuck on a lesson ? Just keep interfacing with a keyboard , camera and perhaps haptic sensors . Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit . Want to prove you are n't faking exams ? Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke -- perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions , too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities into giving away lectures for free . The colleges think they 're establishing good karma with the public , but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame : students deciding to watch free courses , then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out ' badges ' to signify competence in a skill set . The certifiers most likely wo n't be burdened with any of the teaching , research , community service , counseling ( career or otherwise ) , recreation , social events , extracurriculars or other long-standing features of residential university communities . They will just verify that student X can do task Y. It could be a very profitable business . If students pay less for actual instruction by experts , they have more money to spend on badges . This is the for-profit model -- shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing . <p>  Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty , ' ed tech ' firms could muster a just-in-time workforce to develop new educational technologies . Investors could continue ' unbundling ' the university into least-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That vision may draw capital , but it probably wo n't be attractive to many students . There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under-regulated firms . For instance , black-boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that ca n't be accessed by the students it is assessing .  <h> School systems should leverage the same tools society and industry are using to transform their practice <p> Tom Ryan , CEO of eLearn Institute Inc. , responded ,  The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview , but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and moves you to the next level . How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills . As mastery learning evolves , so will our performance-based assessment systems , providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available . Our traditional educational systems are burdened by ' legacy ' bureaucratic practices that do n't contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers . Current job responsibilities do n't allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position . K-12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance , complete grade assessments , fill out grade checks , practice fire drills -- all degrading quality teaching time . If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit , but there is so much more these systems can offer . Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful . Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place . Large school systems ca n't scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice .  <h> The people creating new jobs do n't have time to think about what kind of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp. , replied :  One serious drawback to fast-tracking needed educational and training programs : the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need -- and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture . These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures , filing patents , testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes -- not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries -- that they simply do n't have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating . ... <p>  In the near future , we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution . Educational institutions will not disappear , but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today 's models . ... Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real-world environments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive to an active , dynamic experience . Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts : 1 ) Newer tools are changing our sense of identity . 2 ) We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple , simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment . 3 ) Again , since what we think is what we think through , we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation ( and sense ) of self . ... <p>  The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand , manage and manipulate data . Everyone in a technology-based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants . Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified , and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors , many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much more important , skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem , condition , or opportunity the data is outlining . Said simply , the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts , data , experience and strategic direction that products and services require . Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data-driven world . Data mining and management can be taught effectively . Thinking , problem-solving , reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale .  <p> Elisabeth Gee , professor at Arizona State University and author of  What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy ,  commented ,  First , many jobs of the future wo n't require workers with a lot of training . ... Second , degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment . If the government does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment . Lastly , we do n't need large-scale training of workers -- we need real education ( not job-focused ) and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning .  <h> The greatest thinker of the 21st century will understand more about how she thinks , learns <p> Patrick Tucker , technology editor at Defense One and author of  The Naked Future ,  observed :  Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously , or telemetrically . ... What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability , retention of information , even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day , other calendar items , nutrition , amount of time on Pokemon Go , influence learning . It offers a more true moving score . ... <p>  Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know them today . But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all . Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history . But they will do so only by transitioning away from today 's classroom model toward something else , like data-driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem-solving workshops at the college level . ... <p>  We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms , but if we are to be honest with ourselves , we know that we ca n't prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers . The greatest thinker of the 21st century , whoever he or she is , will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation , and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse . Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain 's electrical activity , detectable via electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory , and , thus , how well a subject will perform on memory tests . Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard . That opportunity does n't come easily in a crowded classroom -- especially not for women or minority students , many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance , they 'll confirm some unflattering , broadly held perception about their social group .  <h> ' We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purposes of education , not ' skills ' <p> David Golumbia , associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University , commented ,  As an educator , I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces . This whole argument is a sham meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect : most ' high-skilled ' jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent . We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education , not on ' skills . '  <h> Few skills require personal instruction from an expert ; all may be automated <p> Stephen Downes , researcher at the National Research Council of Canada , commented ,  We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers , because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves . <p>  Within 10 years , we should be beginning to see that the idea of ' providing ' training education or training is misguided , because it 's overly expensive and less effective than self-managed learning . I find it interesting , even , that the question itself presumes that skills must be ' taught . ' ' Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems ? ' It 's not that the skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills are learned . A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned -- especially multidisciplinary skills , such as critical thinking or social interaction -- without specifically teaching those skills . <p>  There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn -- frankly , I ca n't think of any -- which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all , or nearly all , educational programs may be automated . Of course , they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner , and in many cases , social interaction with other learners , but the labor-intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required . <p>  I see no major objections to this argument : 1 ) It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student , and therefore anticipate what they need . However , in 10 years it will be arguable ( and probably demonstrable ) that your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , even an instructor who worked with you your entire life . Sure , there are disasters like the Facebook news stream , but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them . And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks . 2 ) It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student 's level of achievement . Most actual assessment ( not to be confused with multiple-choice tests ) in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition . The submitted behavior ( an essay , performance in surgery , piloting an aircraft in a simulation ) is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved ( this would possibly be a necessary , but never a sufficient , condition ) . The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met . The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large . With modern communications technology , this proxy is no longer required . <p>  Through the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various activities , they interact with dozens of other people , either in person or through online interaction . Each person responds to them in some way , not by testing them , but by ( for example ) engaging them in conversation , asking questions , following advice , etc . These responses , over time , form a comprehensive ( and constantly changing ) assessment of the person .  <h> What about the future of jobs training for ' artilects ' ? <p> An anonymous postdoctoral fellowat Rice University 's Humanities Research Center observed ,  So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education . I 'd like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence . How will autonomous factories in Chicago , U.S. , share what they 've learned with factories in Pingdingshan , China ? What credentialing system will self-driving cars require ? How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household , business , government institution , or political organization ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs , and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine ?  <p> About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues , attitudes and trends shaping America and the world .

@@18248234 <p> FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday offered his most forceful defense yet of his highly controversial decision to disclose the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation 11 days before last fall 's presidential election . <p> Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Comey said he faced an agonizing choice at the time about whether to sit on the potentially momentous development or share it with Congress . He chose to tell Congress -- a move that many Democrats and political analysts believe delivered the White House to Donald Trump . <p> Story Continued Below <p>  This was terrible . It made me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election , but honestly , it would n't change the decision ,  Comey said . <p>  We honestly made a decision between those two , those two choices , that even in hindsight -- and this has been one of the world 's most painful experiences -- I would make the same decision . I would not conceal that , on Oct. 28 , from the Congress . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come .  <p> Comey 's testimony was the most expansive and detailed insight the FBI chief has offered into his thinking during the days before the election , but it seemed to do little to quiet Democratic senators ' concerns that he applied a double standard that resulted in Clinton being kneecapped in advance of the vote even though the FBI was also -- without public notice -- conducting a politically explosive investigation into the Trump campaign 's possible collusion with Russia . <p> However , the sense of rectitude Comey displayed may give Democrats some solace that the ongoing Trump-Russia probe will be pursued wherever it may lead . <p> Toward the end of Wednesday 's four-hour hearing , Comey briefly suggested that some of the disagreement critics have expressed with his election-eve decision about the email probe might be insincere . <p>  I do n't think many reasonable people would do it differently no matter what they say today ,  the FBI chief said . <p> Comey insisted that the emails discovered on a laptop belonging to ex-Rep . Anthony Weiner weeks before the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The FBI chief said that many of them initially appeared to be from a time in 2009 when thousands of Clinton 's messages were missing . He also said he believed that messages from those months at the outset of Clinton 's tenure as secretary of state could be particularly important because they might indicate why the private email account was set up . <p> Comey said he 'd normally keep such an investigative move secret but ultimately concluded he had a duty to keep Congress informed , as he said he would in earlier testimony . <p>  ' Speak ' would be really bad . There 's an election in 11 days . Lordy , that would be really bad ,  he recalled thinking .  Concealing , in my view , would be catastrophic , not just to the FBI but well beyond , and , honestly , as between really bad and catastrophic , I said to my team , we 've got to walk into the world of really bad .  <p> Comey acknowledged  a great debate  among his advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said one junior attorney on his team did ask at the time if they should consider whether the disclosure to the Hill would tip the election to Trump . <p> Comey said his instincts as an ex-prosecutor were not to do anything that might affect an election , but he concluded that worrying about electing Trump would be wrong to even consider .  Not for a second ,  he said he replied to the junior FBI attorney asking whether that should be factored in .  Down that path lies the death of the FBI .  <p> As it turned out , the newly discovered emails were not momentous . There were about 40,000 in all -- 3,000 of which were related to official State Department work . Just 12 were deemed classified , although Comey acknowledged they should not have been accessible to Weiner , who lacked a security clearance.The FBI chief also disclosed that his investigators turned out to be wrong about something else : how long it would take to pore through the messages . He said they initially told him there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer program the FBI compiled ultimately culled out duplicate messages and had the task completed in just a week . <p>  We 'd seen them all before ,  Comey said of the messages . <p> The timing issue is pivotal because had Comey known that the work could be done in advance of the election , he might have waited to notify Congress once the content of the messages was clear . Instead , he sounded what many Democrats regard as a false alarm that deflated Clinton 's campaign . The Senate hearing came just a day after Clinton said during a public interview that she believed the FBI 's action affected the outcome of the election -- although she framed it as the combined effect of those disclosures and the hacking and public release of her campaign chairman John Podesta 's email account , allegedly by individuals working for Russian interests . <p>  I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey 's letter on October 28th and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .  And the evidence for that intervening event is , I think , compelling , persuasive .  <p> Trump on Tuesday night responded on Twitter by accusing the FBI chief of having gone easy on Clinton over the classified emails found in her private account . <p>  FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds !  Trump wrote . <p> When asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) to comment on the president 's claim Clinton had gotten a  free pass ,  Comey said that was n't his view . <p> At another point in the hearing , Comey said his decision to announce the initial outcome of the Clinton email probe last summer was cemented by Attorney General Loretta Lynch 's so-called tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton on June 27 at the Phoenix airport . <p>  I 'm not picking on the attorney general , Loretta Lynch ... but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The department can not by itself credibly end this , '  Comey said . <p> The FBI director said that development , along with other information he said he could not discuss publicly , led him to decide to disclose the outcome of the Clinton probe without advance permission from Justice Department officials . He said he did call Lynch the day of his announcement to tell her of his general plan but not what he would say . <p>  That was a hard call for me to make , to call the attorney general that morning and say , ' I 'm about to do a press conference and not going to tell you what I 'm going to say . ' I said , ' I hope someday you understand why I 'm doing this , '  Comey said .  I knew this would be disastrous for me personally , but I thought it was the best way to protect the institutions we care about .  <p> During the hearing , the FBI chief found himself slammed by both political camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 presidential election and Republicans questioning the FBI 's reliance on a shadowy dossier of salacious allegations against Trump . <p> At the outset of the hearing , Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) suggested that there 's little substance to the story that has dominated Washington in recent months -- allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government . <p>  Where is all this speculation about collusion coming from ?  Grassley asked , as he raised reports that the FBI actually paid the author of the dossier , which included allegedly compromising intelligence against Trump . <p>  Where did the money come from , and what motivated the people writing the dossier ?  he said .  Unfortunately , the FBI has provided me materially inconsistent information about these issues ,  the chairman complained .  Once you buy into the claim of collusion , then suddenly every interaction with a Russian can be twisted to seem like confirmation of a conspiracy theory .  <p> The top Democrat on the panel , Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official disclosures about Clinton during the campaign but left the investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign largely in the shadows . <p>  I join those who believe that the actions taken by the FBI did in fact have an impact on the election ,  Feinstein said .  I can not help but note that the FBI was noticeably silent about the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the election . ... I ca n't imagine how an unprecedented big and bold hacking interference in our election by the Russian government did not also present exceptional circumstances .  <p> Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) also said Comey 's Oct. 28 letter to Congress about the Clinton probe had clearly roiled the campaign . <p>  There 's no question that that had great effect . Historians can debate what kind of effect it was ,  Leahy said . <p> Comey said the probes were treated similarly in that both inquiries were not publicly confirmed until several months after they were underway . <p>  I think I 've treated both investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del. ) rejected Comey 's claim that he had only two options last October . <p>  I do think there was a third door available to you , and that was to confirm the existence of an ongoing investigation about the Trump campaign ,  Coons declared .  Had there been public notice that there was renewed investigation into both campaigns , I think the impact would have been different .  <p> Comey said he did favor calling the public 's attention in general terms to the Russian efforts and actually proposed writing an op-ed on the issue last August . The Obama White House turned that down , opting to make findings of a broad intelligence assessment public some two months later . <p>  I thought it was very important myself to call out Russia ,  the FBI director said .  That 's a separate question from whether -- do you confirm the existence of the classified investigation that had just started . ... We do n't know what we have , what is there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Comey 's decisionmaking at the height of the presidential campaign . <p>  I think you were given an impossible choice to make and you did the best you could ,  Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said . <p>  It looks like you were trying to provide as much transparency and as much real-time information as you had ,  Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina added . <p> However , some GOP senators pressed Comey on why no charges were filed against Clinton aide Huma Abedin , even though emails deemed to be classified were found on the laptop of her estranged husband , Weiner . <p>  We did n't have any indication that she had a sense that what she was doing was in violation of the law -- to provide any sort of criminal intent ,  Comey said . He said Abedin apparently sent the messages to Weiner so he could print them for her . <p>  My understanding is his role was to print them out as a matter of convenience ,  the FBI director said . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Comey also said that he 's determined to get to the bottom of who may have leaked sensitive information about the Clinton email probe or the Trump-Russia inquiry , including whether former FBI officials or prosecutors were given inside details about the investigations . <h> Become a Washington insider <p> Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news , every morning -- in your inbox <p> Email <p> By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO .

Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C . ) , Comey confirmed he discussed the issue with Yates , who is set to testify about the issue next week before a Senate subcommittee chaired by Graham . <p> Yates is expected to tell senators she delivered a strong and unusual warning to the White House in January that Flynn had lied about his contacts with Russia and was vulnerable to being compromised .

Everything was trumped , literally and figuratively , by that .  <p> Drew Hammill , Pelosi 's deputy chief of staff , later clarified the lawmaker 's comments , saying in a statement that Democrats are aware of ideological differences within the party but they together believe  legislating those beliefs onto others is a complete non-starter .  <p> Pelosi said Democrats are unified by  our values about working families .  <p>  Some people are more or less enthusiastic about this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@18264665 <p> With House Republicans prepared to take a vote Thursday on yet another version of a plan to overhaul the 2010 Affordable Care Act , attention has been especially focused on whether Obamacare 's popular prohibition against denying coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions will remain in place . Republicans , from President Trump to lawmakers pushing for the bill , insist that it remains intact , just in different form . Democrats and opponents of the bill say the guarantee is gone or greatly weakened . <p> Here 's a tweet by House Speaker Paul Ryan referring to an amendment added to the bill to attract votes : <p> The reality is far more nuanced and complicated , as is often the case in Washington policy debates . Despite Ryan 's tweet that people with pre-existing conditions are protected , there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law . The impact of recent tweaks to the proposed legislation is especially unclear because lawmakers are rushing ahead without an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . So here 's a guide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies could consider a person 's health status when determining premiums , sometimes making coverage unaffordable or even unavailable if a person was already sick with a problem that required expensive treatment . The ACA prohibited that , in part by requiring everyone to purchase insurance . <p> But that  individual mandate  was unpopular and Republicans would eliminate that requirement in their proposed American Health Care Act . As a replacement , the AHCA initially included a continuous coverage provision that boosted insurance rates by 30 percent for one year if he or she has a lapse in coverage . <p> As part of an effort to attract more votes , Republicans have added an amendment , crafted by Rep. Tom McArthur , R-N.J. , that instead allows states to seek individual waivers from the law . One possible waiver would replace the continuous coverage provision so that insurance companies for one year could consider a person 's health status when writing policies in the individual and small group plan markets . Another possible waiver would allow the state to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of benefits , again limited to the individual and small-group markets . <p> The theory is that removing sicker people from the markets and allowing policies with skimpier options would result in lower overall premiums . <h> Who would be affected ? <p> If the law passed , a person generally would not be affected unless they lived in a state that sought a waiver . Moreover , they would need to have a lapse in health coverage for longer than 63 days and they would need to have a pre-existing condition . Finally , they would have to purchase insurance in the individual market , i.e. , the health exchanges in Obamacare that currently serve about 18 million Americans . <p> Someone who got their insurance from an employer - and that 's most Americans ( 155 million ) - presumably would not be affected , though the CBO did project that under the initial version of the AHCA 7 million fewer people would be covered by employers than under current law by 2026 . <p> Then , for a period of one year , a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be based on their individual condition . But states that seek a waiver are required to operate a risk mitigation program or participate in what is called an invisible risk sharing program . Alaska currently has such a program that helps cover the bills for one of 33 conditions ( such as HIV/AIDS or metastatic cancer ) . The individual with the condition still submits bills to the insurance company , which then turns around and bills the state . But then the insurance company does not consider the cost of this care as part of its calculation for premiums to other individuals in the state . <p> All told , the AHCA would allot $138 billion over 10 years for a variety of funds that would seek to keep premiums lower or to assist with cost-sharing . Just this week , $8 billion over five years was added to the pot to woo wavering lawmakers , with the idea that the additional funds could be used for so-called high-risk pools . Many states had such pools to help people with pre-existing conditions before the ACA . But the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up such a pool . <h> What could go wrong then ? <p> There are many uncertainties about this path . The health insurance market has a lot of churn , so many people may experience a gap in coverage of just a few months . One estimate , by the Commonwealth Fund , indicated that 30 million adults would have had such a gap in 2016 , potentially exposing them to a surcharge or being placed in a high-risk pool . On top of that , the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 percent of the people in the individual market have existing conditions that would have been uninsured before the ACA . <p> The AHCA eliminates cost sharing and offers a stingier tax credit to defray premium costs , likely resulting in higher overall health costs that may make insurance unaffordable for many people . ( The CBO projected that 24 million more people would be without health insurance than under current law by 2026 . ) <p> Then , if people get sick , they may suddenly find themselves for a year being priced on their illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on the approach taken by a state , some people might find it difficult to keep up their coverage for a full year before they qualify for prices at the community rate . <p> A big question is whether the funding to cover these folks is adequate . High-risk pools were big money losers and underfunded in the pre-Obamacare days , even though many had restrictions , high premiums and waiting lists . A $5 billion federal pool , established by the ACA as a bridge to the creation of the exchanges in 2013 , covered about 100,000 people but was suspended when it ran out of money . <p> The Center for American Progress , a left-leaning group that opposes the AHCA , produced an analysis that indicated that even with the additional $8 billion , the maximum enrollment the AHCA 's funds would cover is about 700,000 people . If just 5 percent of the people currently in the individual market ended up in high-risk pools - and all states sought a waiver - that would overwhelm the proposed funding . <p> When states had high-risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the non-group health insurance participants . But given the limitations of those funds , that percentage may not be a good guide for what would happen under the AHCA . <p> Whenever health-care laws are changed , there are unknown and unintended consequences . The current system does not take into account a person 's health status when assessing premiums . But , as a Brookings Institution analysis suggested , under the AHCA 's provisions , healthy people might have an incentive to join plans based on health status . That would leave sicker people in the community rated plans , which in turn would face higher premiums . Over time , that could make the community rating meaningless . Another possible outcome : If the pool of money is used to pay insurance companies for the difference in costs for patients with pre-existing conditions , there may be little incentive for companies to keep their prices low ; the difference would be made up by U.S. taxpayers . <h> The bottom line <p> When it comes to health care , readers should be wary about claims that important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  protected  - or that the changes will result in massive dislocation and turmoil . There are always winners and losers in a bill of this size . In this case , if the bill ever became law , much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states - and then how those decisions are implemented .

Wenner finds Rolling Stone being showcased in a once-unthinkable forum : a museum . <p>  At least it 's a museum I own ,  Wenner said with a laugh during a recent telephone interview as he anticipated an anniversary exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland , an institution that Wenner helped found in the 1980s . The three-floor  Rolling Stone/50 years  exhibit opens Friday and runs through late November . <p> There might not have been a Rock Hall or museum without Rolling Stone , which as much as anybody moved rock and the lifestyle around it from the fringes to the mainstream .

Thompson . Among those getting early starts at Rolling Stone were Leibovitz , Thompson , the music critics Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs , screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and filmmaker Cameron Crowe . <p> The common thread among the best Rolling Stone contributors has been  extraordinary talent ,  Wenner says , along with a  sense of purpose  and a distinctive way of  seeing our times .  <p> The exhibit and accompanying coffee-table book capture some of the highlights : Thompson 's scathing coverage of the 1972 presidential campaign , the serialization of Tom Wolfe 's  The Bonfire of the Vanities  and Michael Hastings ' scandalously candid 2010 profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , leading to his departure as commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .

Youth tycoons are common now , but 50 years ago it was rare for someone Wenner 's age to be running any business , at least one that hoped to make money . His hope then was to bring attention to the music he loved and how it was changing the culture , changes he believed were ignored or belittled by the mainstream media . <p>  The Beatles and Stones and Dylan are all working at the same time and all ( are ) bouncing off each other ,  he says , calling it an  extraordinary alignment of the stars .  <p> Rolling Stone was n't the first serious rock music publication : Crawdaddy , led by Swarthmore College student Paul Williams , began in 1966 .

No more hiding legislative language from the minority party , opponents and the public . Legislation should be understood by all interested parties before it is voted on . <p> Republicans may argue that most of their bill has technically been available for review for a long time now , except for the late changes . But it 's clear this bill does n't meet that latter part of their promise -- that language should  be understood by all interested parties  before it is voted on .

The Wall Street Journal reported early Thursday that it could get rid of out-of-pocket maximums not for Obamacare recipients but for employer plans -- the kind the vast majority of Americans have . The New York Times is now reporting that the bill could cut funding for special education programs . Those are two potentially huge impacts that received basically no attention until the vote was announced . <p> Skeptical Republicans who have come around to this bill are basically investing their trust -- and potentially their political futures -- in Ryan and congressional leaders without a thorough vetting of what they are voting on . And it 's a bill that will affect tens of millions of Americans under Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion . It 's a bill that the CBO has said would reduce the number of insured Americans by 24 million come 2026 . And the recent changes to Obamacare 's preexisting coverage mandate , which allow states to apply for waivers and insurers to charge those with preexisting conditions more , risk pricing these people out of the market . <p> The late solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with $8 billion , hoping to reduce the burden on those with preexisting conditions . But experts are highly skeptical that 's enough money . And Rep.

After all , the Senate still has to vote on it and is guaranteed to make changes before the House and Senate come together to reconcile the two versions . The final bill will clearly be different than it is now , if there is a final bill . Basically , Republicans are passing this bill so that they can check the box and get to the next step , knowing this wo n't be the final product . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially given the GOP 's righteous indignation over how Democrats proceeded on their own overhaul of the nation 's health care system .

But instead of being spooked out of the trade , Cormie pushed ahead and turned the market meltdown into a life-lesson for investing : Look for the buying opportunities and never give up on your strategy . <p> A little more than a decade later , he used that philosophy to steer through the dot-com bubble as global equity chief at J.P . Morgan Investment Management in London .

Here 's the edited interview : <p> How should investors behave with this heightened level of political uncertainty ? <p> My experience tells me very strongly that in times of uncertainty , and when you are unsure what the future looks like , it 's critical that you focus on what you believe in as an investor and what your investment philosophy is . <p> And while you do that , think about the two/three things that give you a competitive edge compared with everybody else in the market . <p> Do n't get caught up in the emotion . If you abandon what you believe in and what you are good at to follow emotions along with everyone else , you are more likely to be a loser than a winner . <p>  Do n't get caught in the noise and try to be something that you are not .  <p> Do you find investors with less experience are more likely to get caught up in the emotion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day .

Do n't get caught in the noise and try to be something that you are not . <p> You 've experienced several market crashes . What have you learned from that ? <p> I was pretty junior , but I was managing money in October 1987 in the Black Monday crash .

That was causing us some pain and underperformance , and there were times when clients were getting quite frustrated . <p> But we stayed true to our philosophy and our process , and when the market changed , it changed violently and quickly , and the people who had chased performance got very badly burned . We made back everything that we 'd lost and more , in terms of performance , by sticking to our disciplines . <p> U.S. stock markets are trading around record highs .

If it was easy , we 'd all be making a lot of money . <p> Do you have any experiences that stand out to you as particularly good or bad ? <p> When I started covering emerging markets in the 1990s , I went with an analyst to visit a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the company , and he told us what bright prospects they had for the future , and it was a very optimistic meeting .

18266436," President Trump has vowed to repeal the Johnson Amendment , because he says it infringes on the freedom of speech of religious groups . Here is what you need to know about this amendment . ( Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post ) <p> During the election , Donald Trump made a promise that few people anticipated : He would do away with the Johnson Amendment , which in 1954 effectively barred pastors from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit . <p> In recent years , religious liberty issues have gotten caught up in debates over contraception and LGBT rights . But Trump 's promise was a throwback to the 1950s , an era when many pastors felt they were freer to say what they believed . He repeated the promise to religious leaders during his campaign , and on Thursday -- the National Day of Prayer -- they saw him begin to deliver . <p> The president first announced his plans for an executive order on religious liberty to about 45 pastors in the White House on Wednesday night , according to Robert Jeffress , pastor of First Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Trump 's evangelical advisory council during his campaign , were joined in the Blue Room by several members of the administration , including Vice President Mike Pence ; Trump 's daughter Ivanka and her husband , Jared Kushner ; chief strategist Steve Bannon ; and chief of staff Reince Priebus . Jeffress said administration officials were still working on the details , but Trump promised to effectively halt the Johnson Amendment . ( It would take an act of Congress to change the law . ) On Thursday , the president held a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Rose Garden . <p> President Trump is expected to sign an executive order May 4 allowing American churches and other tax-exempt groups to exercise greater political activity . Trump has railed against what 's known as the Johnson Amendment , a 1954 law circumscribing political activity for groups seeking tax exemption . ( Reuters ) <p> Jeffress told the group that the amendment was a hindrance , saying that left-leaning groups have used it to  harass  pastors like him for speaking out on political issues .  It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to speak openly ,  Jeffress said . <p> The announcement was an  unexpected delight and pleasant surprise  to people in the room , said Ralph Reed , chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition . During the dinner , those gathered also learned that Congress would vote Thursday on repealing the Affordable Care Act , which would include pulling funding from Planned Parenthood .  These folks walked off the White House about 10 feet off the ground ,  Reed said . <p> Trump 's promises Many religious conservatives who endorsed Trump have been waiting for him to continue fulfilling a series of promises he made during his campaign . After years of battling with the Obama administration , many of them see Trump as a breath of fresh air . <p> During the election , Trump made a special effort to reach out to white evangelicals in particular , meeting with several of them in Trump Tower and creating the evangelical advisory council that gave him feedback throughout the campaign . He received support from other religious groups , but white evangelicals voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other groups . <p> While evangelicals vary in their views of Trump , a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that white Catholics and white evangelicals who attend religious services regularly have a higher approval rating of Trump than those who do n't attend services regularly . <p> James MacDonald , a megachurch pastor of Harvest Bible Chapel who served on Trump 's evangelical advisory council , had called Trump  lecherous and worthless  after it was revealed that he had made lewd comments about women in a 2005 video . On Wednesday , MacDonald said he is pleased with Trump 's efforts as president . <p>  The conscientious effort to make good on the campaign promises is very apparent ,  MacDonald said .  Only a hardened and cynical person would conclude that he 's not trying to keep the campaign promises .  <p> Ahead of Trump 's 100th day in office last week , some religious conservatives , like the Rev. CJ Conner , a pastor of a Kansas church , were worried the president could  forget us  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Mr. President ,  Conner wrote in an open letter published at Charisma , a magazine for Pentecostals , in which he urged Trump to uphold  Christian freedoms .  <p>  Thousands of us have sacrificed our standing in our denominations ,  Conner wrote .  Some have been fired from our congregations for supporting you . We have suffered in many ways , but our families have suffered the most .  <p> Before the news of the Johnson amendment this week , R. R. Reno , who edits the ecumenical magazine First Things , echoed many religious conservatives by saying he was still waiting for Trump to deliver on promises he made . <p> Trump had promised -- saying ,  I will fight for you  -- to protect the religious freedoms of groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor , a group of nuns that battled the Obama administration over contraceptive coverage . But many religious leaders want Trump to permanently end Barack Obama 's mandate requiring contraception coverage , an issue that has gotten caught up in larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a wait-and-see attitude ,  said Reno , who surprised many of his conservative friends by endorsing Trump .  It 's not disappointing , but he has n't thrilled us either .  <p> Continued access to the White House <p> The biggest win for religious conservatives has been Trump 's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court , which they consider key to winning future cases involving religious liberty or abortion . Trump has also rolled back federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity . <p>  Interestingly , as much as President Bush is revered by evangelicals , in a certain way , they have even more trust of Donald Trump ,  Jeffress said . <p> Jeffress said evangelicals are especially pleased with Trump 's outreach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He also expects Trump to turn his attention to persecuted Christians overseas , an issue Trump emphasized early in his term . <p> Abortion rights opponents have been pleased by Trump 's appointments , including making Charmaine Yoest -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant secretary of communications for Health and Human Services . Penny Nance , president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America , said she was nervous when Trump took office because he had no record in Washington .

It was this moment for me that was , ' This is legit .

18268163," As Sunday 's vote nears , the issue of anti-Semitism has raised its head in a country that contributed to the Holocaust . <h> By <h> By <p> Paris , France - On July 16 and 17 , 1942 , French police rounded up 13,152 Jews - including 4,000 children - and held them at an indoor cycle-racing track not far from the Eiffel Tower . <p> Later , they were moved to an internment camp in Drancy , a northeastern suburb . From there , they were shipped in rail cattle cars to Auschwitz for their mass murder . <p> Deportations continued for two more years after the so-called  Vel ' d'Hiv roundup  , until the end of the German occupation . In total , at least 77,000 Jews living in France were swept to their deaths in concentration camps - most in Auschwitz , some on French soil . <p> It was not until 53 years later in 1995 that a French leader recognised France 's role in the massacre , which took place under the collaborationist Vichy regime - the common name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II . <p> The monument for the commemoration of the Vel ' d'Hiv roundup Raymond Bobar/Al Jazeera <p> Then , President Jacques Chirac apologised on behalf of the French policemen and civil servants who served in the raid . <p>  Yes , the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French , by the French state ,  he said .  France , on that day , committed an irreparable act . It failed to keep its word and delivered those under its protection to their executioners .  <p> Until that moment , the official line was that France or the French Republic bears no responsibility and all blame should be directed at Vichy - a stance considered to be anti-Semitic . <p> Now , as she bids for France 's top job , the far-right leader and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has recirculated this argument - a move that would not have been at all surprising had it been played by her more openly bigoted father and founder of the National Front party ( FN ) , Jean-Marie Le Pen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , who is attempting to detoxify the party 's fascist , racist and anti-Semitic image . <p>  France is not responsible for the Vel ' d'Hiv ,  she told RTL radio last month .  Those responsible were those in power then . This is not France .  <h> ' FN a living expression of anti-Semitism ' <p>  Marine Le Pen has been working hard to give the impression that her party has changed , but it only fools the foolish . Her recent statement ... indicates very well the shallowness of the party 's metamorphosis ,  Maxime Benatouil , co-chair of the French Jewish Union for Peace ( L'UJFP ) , told Al Jazeera . <p> On Wednesday , with four days to go until the second round , Le Pen 's centrist rival Emmanuel Macron challenged her interpretation of responsibility in a televised debate . <p>  The fact that Vichy is France is so obvious it does n't need to be discussed ,  Laurent Levy , an author and activist , told Al Jazeera .  Le Pen 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she said that .  <p> Le Pen was also possibly trying to appease the traditional anti-Semites that raised her within the FN , from which she has temporarily stood down ahead of Sunday 's decisive vote , Levy said . <p> ' The fight against anti-Semitism has been mostly used as a weapon of Islamophobia , ' Levy said Raymond Bobar/Al Jazeera <p>  She has to reassure part of her party , those who do n't recognise the party she has developed , those who say she 's now inside the system instead of against it ,  he said .  Maybe she just thought she was being patriotic by saying France has a clean record and is perfect .  <p> Macron , on the other hand , has acknowledged the stained pages of French history . He has visited sites related to the history of collaboration , and while in Algeria in February condemned France 's colonial past as  a crime against humanity  . <p>  He does not want to be held responsible for not preventing what happened in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sociologist and professor at the University of Paris 8 , told Al Jazeera .  The FN is a living expression of anti-Semitism in France . The reasons why it has not disappeared have to do with the fact the French are still very keen on remaining white . It 's a matter of Frenchness seen as whiteness . <p>  Although it is widely considered that Jews have become ' white ' , for those who consider that Jews can not be white , for them anti-Semitism still makes sense . It 's an identitarian resource that they exploit very strongly .  <h> The rise of anti-Semitic attacks <p> There are between 500,000 and 600,000 Jews living in France . <p> CRIF , or the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France , says that anti-Semitism has increased since 2002 . <p> Among the gravest examples are the 2006 murder of 23-year-old Ilan Halimi ; the 2012 shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse that left three children and a teacher dead ; and the killing of four Jews in 2015 at a kosher supermarket in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CRIF and reports in some Israeli media , a feeling of insecurity has led to an increase in the number of Jews settling in Israel . <p> However , some argue that the issue has become politicised . <p> CRIF says in 2013 , 3,500 left for Israel , up from an average of between 1,000 and 1,800 per year . In 2014 , that number rose to 7,000 and then 8,000 in 2015 . <p>  There is a climate of fear among Jewish religious and secular communities , no doubt about that ,  said Benatouil , of L'UJFP .  However , it is very hard to say whether France-based Zionist figures are n't simply adding fuel on fire by making it bigger than it actually is .  <p> Last year , the number of those relocating to Israel dropped to 5,000 - a relative decrease . <p>  Aliyah Jews relocating to Israel has been promoted in France by the Israeli state for a long time ,  said Guenif .  There is some sort of overstatement about moving to Israel since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of anti-Semitism in France ' Raymond Bobar/Al Jazeera <p>  During the 2000s , when there was this increase of anti-Semitic acts or statements against Jews , there was strong promotion of returning to Israel inside the Jewish community in France . There was a very strong policy of getting them to move to Israel ... Aliyah is not as strong as it seems ,  she said , adding that many who leave - a majority of whom are of North African descent - soon return because of racism in Israel . <h> ' The divisive politics of white French supremacy ' <p> According to a 2014 study by Fondapol , a think-tank , three groups are responsible for rising hate crimes against Jews : the extreme right , the extreme left and Muslims . <p>  Anti-Semitic acts are often conducted by young Muslims ,  Robert Ejnes , the head of CRIF , told Al Jazeera .  All terrorist attacks have been made in the name of Allah . We know this is a hijacking of Islam by these jihadists .  <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Semitism , Europe 's largest Muslim minority of five million is too often grouped together as one homogenous group , scapegoated , and demonised as the first anti-Semites of France . <p>  The fight against anti-Semitism has been mostly used as a weapon of Islamophobia ,  said Laurent .  People say anti-Semitism is only something proper to the Muslim part of the population , but the evidence that that is not true has risen .  <p> The charge of anti-Semitism is often directed at those who question Israeli policy and argue against Zionism - including Muslim critics . <p>  Some Jews in France ... feel like they are themselves under attack when we denounce the crimes of Israel ,  said Levy , adding that the already heated debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in France intensified during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in 2014 . <p> But reports of violence on the street between Jewish and Muslim communities are exaggerated , Levy said . <p> The Grand Synagogue of Paris Raymond Bobar/Al Jazeera <p>  There might be tiny problems here or there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing the kippah pass some men with beards , there is an electricity . I would also add that the image of a man with a beard is not the typical Muslim in France .  <p>  Anti-Semitic acts could be from all parts , but I 'm not sure Muslims are so keen on desecrating tombs in cemeteries ,  said Guenif .  The divisive politics of white French supremacy are effective in dividing and pitting minorities , one against the other .  <p> Another concern is how France deals with its various minorities . <p>  The problem does not lie with Judaism and Islam , or between Muslims and Jews . The problem is political ,  said Benatouil .  When you have a state which would defend Israel no matter what , do everything it can to preserve the memory of the Jewish sufferings while doing too little or nothing with the memory of other communities , what do you think happens ?  <p> He added that Muslims , often targeted as Islam is conflated with  terrorism  , tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  What happens is exactly what we live now in France : a hate , which sometimes takes on the clothes of anti-Semitism and which is based on a legitimate feeling of double standard , pops up .

The Alliance Defending Freedom , which organizes the event , said that after eight years of public violations , no church had been punished by the IRS for participating . <p> A change to the tax law to actually eradicate the Johnson Amendment would require action by Congress . That could have a dramatic effect on campaign fundraising , if churches and nonprofits were allowed to funnel tax-free money into political campaigns . <p> But Trump does n't have the authority to eliminate the law single-handedly .

At that point , the federal government would step in to cover the contraception instead . ( Some religious groups have claimed the law requires coverage of abortion-inducing drugs called abortifacients as well as contraception . But as NPR has reported , the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus is that none of the mandated contraceptive methods cause abortions . ) <p> As Julie Rovner wrote last year , dozens of religious nonprofits claimed  that even the act of notifying the government of their objections ( which would , in turn , trigger a requirement for the government to arrange coverage ) made them ' complicit ' in providing a service they see as sinful .  <p> The issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baylor of the Alliance Defending Freedom said  regulatory relief ,  if provided , would still be inadequate . <p>  The answer to this problem has been quite obvious all along ,  Baylor said .

@@18274496 <p> Like most superhero movies , Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 leaves the viewer with plenty of questions . Yet one of the biggest head-scratchers from the film is n't about how the story will continue in a sequel , or why a fan favorite was left out of the picture -- it 's about why a certain character negatively highlights the looks of another , repeatedly throughout the film . Seriously , why does Drax call Mantis ugly in Guardians 2 ? The  joke  is n't funny , and it takes away from an otherwise enjoyable film . <p> Some background ( and some spoilers ) : in the new movie , the Guardians are introduced to Mantis , an alien with empathic abilities ( she can read people 's emotions , and sometimes control them ) who 's had little prior social interaction . She 's awkward and naive , and so she makes a good companion for Drax , the brutish , straightforward warrior whose behavior and sense of humor are often outside the human norm . Yet while Drax and Mantis share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship is defined by one thing only : Drax 's constant labeling of her as  ugly .  <p> Several times throughout the movie , Drax notes how  ugly  or  disgusting  he finds Mantis , saying that she 's far too skinny and unappealing for anyone to ever like . Mantis ' own naivety -- the only person she 's ever met in her life is Ego ( Kurt Russell ) -- makes it so she takes Drax 's comments to heart , not questioning them in the slightest . As for the audience , Drax 's criticism are meant to be played for laughs ; we 're supposed to find the comments funny , because Drax is clearly wrong ( Mantis , portrayed by Pom Klementieff , is attractive ) and so he ca n't be taken seriously . <p> Walt Disney Studios <p> But the thing is , he is . Guardians 2 may want you to view his comments as silly humor , but there 's not much that 's funny about an adult male character repeatedly telling a child-like female character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give Drax 's comments a silver lining ( he tells Mantis that because she 's supposedly unattractive , she will know if someone truly loves her , since they will have to look beyond her looks , and that is a gift ) , but it does n't excuse what he says . <p> And yes , the franchise makes clear that Drax 's view of the world is not the  right  one , and so his comments about Mantis are meant to be seen as completely off-base , and therefore funny . But for young girls watching Guardians 2 , all they might hear is a man telling a woman that she 's ugly , over and over again . In a world where women 's looks are constantly subject to judgment , especially from men , this , even as a  joke ,  might reinforce a dangerous message and bring out young viewers ' own insecurities . We all know how damaging it can be for girls to hear criticism about their appearance at an early age ( and Mantis , despite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even more , it 's disappointing to see Mantis , who has the potential to be an interesting , complicated character , be reduced to no more than a punchline to show off Drax 's  humor .  Women , especially those in superhero movies , rarely get the chance to have actual personalities and plotlines . And while Guardians may have more female characters than most of its Marvel peers , women in the film are still greatly outnumbered by men , with Mantis joining just three other ladies . The franchise ca n't really afford to waste one of the few women it has , and yet that 's exactly what it does with Mantis , letting Drax 's  joke  about her appearance be the main takeaway audiences get from her character . <p> Perhaps , in the next Guardians movie , Mantis will get a storyline she deserves , one in which her looks are not the focus -- or even mentioned at all .

@@18276085 <p> Experts in education clamor for more accountability and change in schools -- especially those in high-poverty communities . For them the problem in high-poverty schools is n't trauma or the lingering effects of poverty , but the fact that principals and teachers are n't accountable for their students ' success . <p> I tend to think support and consistency are more important to improving these schools . But let 's assume for the moment that accountability and change will produce the results we all desire . If that were the case , should n't test scores in Detroit be skyrocketing ? <p> No Child Left Behind mandated accountability and change in 2001 . Since then more than 100 schools in Detroit have been closed and at least half that many have been opened . Education experts also created a new school district to take over 15 Detroit schools , and most of the principals and teachers in those schools were fired . We have not been short on accountability and change . <p> To determine which schools should close , the state uses test results from the M-STEP -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 ( and 11 ) -- that took students up to 16 hours to complete and schools eight full weeks to administer last year . Schools that score in the lowest 5 percent are automatically put on the State 's Priority Schools list -- a 21st century scarlet letter that can only be taken away if a school gets to at least 6 percent , or if it makes an approved change , like firing the principal or becoming a charter . After that , the school has three years to get and stay out of the lowest 5 percent before it is at risk of being closed again . <p> In January , less than three weeks after state control of schools in the Detroit Public Schools Community District ended , the state announced it would close up to 25 schools in Detroit for failing to get above the 5 percent threshold under the state 's watch . The state also sent a letter to parents in those schools encouraging them to put their children in better school districts outside of Detroit , including those an hour 's drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the one they intended . This year hundreds of parents in Detroit joined the hundreds of thousands of parents across the nation who are opting out of state-mandated tests . <p> While many principals honored our parents ' decision to opt-out ( and even expressed their support ) , some school leaders resorted to intimidation . They refused to accept the opt-out letters and told parents their children had to take the test or the school would be penalized and lose federal funding . <p> Perhaps these principals were following the orders of State Superintendent Brian Whiston , who recently wrote a letter to parents stating ,  There is no allowable way in state or federal law to ' opt out ' of state assessments . Students who are not assessed will count against their schools ' participation rate , leaving schools open to penalties .  <p> But the superintendent 's warning contradicts the Michigan School Code . And no school or district anywhere in the nation has ever lost federal funding for parents ' choosing to opt out . <p> Education experts who believe so strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents who exercise their right to direct the education of their child . More than 400 parents have said ,  Enough is enough !  this year . If the state continues to act in the same way , it should n't be surprised to see that number to grow significantly in the years to come .

@@18276087 <h> Share story <p> The American Health Care Act , which won passage in the House on Thursday , could transform the nation 's health-insurance system and create a new slate of winners and losers . <p> Although the Senate is likely to demand changes , this bill , if it became law in its current form , would repeal and replace large portions of the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare . It would change the rules and subsidies for people who buy their own insurance coverage , and make major cuts to the Medicaid program , which pays for care for the poor and disabled . <p> Any change in a complex health-care system leaves some people and businesses better or worse off . For some , insurance will become more affordable -- or their taxes will be lower . Others will lose out on financial support or health-care coverage . <h> THE WINNERS <p> The winners tend to be higher earners , who would get tax benefits or more help buying their health-insurance premiums . Many businesses would also benefit from tax cuts or reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The bill eliminates two taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 a year or couples earning more than $250,000 : a 0.9 percent increase on the Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income . It also allows people to save more money in tax-excluded health-savings accounts , a change most useful to people with enough money to have savings . <p> Upper-middle-class people without pre-existing health conditions : The Affordable Care Act cut off subsidies to help people buy their insurance at an income of about $48,000 for a single person . The American Health Care Act lets people get government subsidies much higher up the income scale -- up to about $150,000 . But the bill allows states to waive rules on minimum benefit standards and rules that prevent insurance companies from charging higher prices to customers with pre-existing illnesses . That means the gap between the tax subsidies and the cost of care could widen , even for some people who will get extra financial help . <p> Young , middle-class people without pre-existing health conditions : The bill would change how insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices for young customers . It also gives them a flat subsidy that is , in many cases , higher than what they would receive under Obamacare . There is some variation by region , and people with pre-existing conditions could be charged higher prices in some states . <p> People who wish to go without insurance : The bill eliminates the individual mandate , which charges a tax penalty to Americans who can afford insurance but do not obtain it . <p> People wanting less comprehensive health coverage : The bill allows insurers to offer health plans with higher deductibles and co-payments , a change likely to lower premiums . Customers in states that waive benefit rules may also be able to buy plans not covering as many medical services , like maternity coverage . <p> Large employers : The bill would eliminate Obamacare 's employer mandate , which required large employers to offer affordable coverage to their workers . Companies that do not cover their workers would face no penalty . It would free all large employers of the complex reporting necessary to enforce the provision , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . <p> Medical device companies , indoor tanning companies and a few other medical industries : The bill would roll back taxes on devices , tanning , prescription drugs and health-insurance products . Some of those industries may lose a little as well ; insurance companies , for example , may have fewer paying customers . <h> THE LOSERS <p> Losers under the bill tend to be poorer , sicker and older Americans , the groups that were helped most by the Affordable Care Act . The bill would also put stress on the budgets of many health-care providers . <p> The poor : Many states would be expected to roll back their expansions of Medicaid to cover childless adults without disabilities . The bill would also substantially reduce subsidies available for Americans just over the poverty line , the group that benefited most from Obamacare 's subsidies . Poor Americans are much more likely to become uninsured under the bill , according to the Congressional Budget Office , and those who retain coverage would pay much more of their limited incomes on premiums and deductibles . <p> Older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the bill better for many young Americans make it worse for those who are older . Insurance companies can charge a 64-year-old customer five times the price charged to an 18-year-old one , to cite the most extreme example . The changes in the subsidy formula also require older middle-class Americans to pay a much larger share of their health-insurance bill . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that far fewer older Americans will have insurance coverage under this bill than under the Affordable Care Act . <p> People with pre-existing health conditions , particularly in some states : The bill allows states to waive rules on minimum benefit standards and rules that prohibit insurance companies from charging higher prices to customers with a history of serious illness -- or even minor diseases . And it could mean their insurance covers fewer medical services . The benefit changes could also affect Medicaid beneficiaries , and they could mean cutbacks on coverage for mental-health and drug-addiction treatment . States that waive the rule about prices would be required to set up a program for high-risk customers , and would get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear . <p> State governments : The bill would cut back substantially on federal funding for state Medicaid programs , while offering states only limited new flexibility in how they manage them . Over time , the changes would probably shift an increasing share of Medicaid costs onto states . <p> Hospitals : Assessing an earlier version of the bill , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance in a decade . Some of those would still have medical emergencies and require hospital care . Obamacare made substantial cuts in how much Medicare pays hospitals , on the theory that they would make up the difference with more paying customers . The Republican bill does not restore any of the cuts . Hospitals in poor communities where a lot of people signed up for Medicaid would probably experience the biggest hit . <p> Planned Parenthood : The bill would prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money for one year , a major hit for a health-care provider that relies substantially on payments from Medicaid and the Title X family-planning grant to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bill would also seek to reduce access to abortions , by preventing federal subsidies from going to any health plan that covers abortions . <p> The bill is likely to change substantially in the Senate . Several Republican senators have expressed concerns about the bill 's cuts to Medicaid . Two dislike the cuts to Planned Parenthood 's funding . A few have expressed worries about access to insurance for Americans with pre-existing health conditions . ( One , Rand Paul , of Kentucky , has said the bill does n't go far enough in cutting back Obamacare 's coverage expansion . ) But the bill 's broad contours -- its shifting of resources from older , sicker , poorer Americans toward those who are younger , healthier and wealthier -- may persist and become law .

18280110," House repeal of ' Obamacare ' hands hot potato to wary Senate <h> House repeal of ' Obamacare ' hands hot potato to wary Senate <p> May 5th , 2017by Associated Press in Breaking News <p> President Donald Trump talks with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. , in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington , Thursday , May 4 , 2017 , after the House pushed through a health care bill . House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of La. is at left , and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady , R-Texas is at right . ( AP Photo/Evan Vucci ) <h> Related Article <h> Local politicians ' reactions <p>  I congratulate the House on passage of its bill . The Senate will now finish work on our bill , but will take the time to get it right . My own goals for a Senate bill include : 1 ) rescuing the thousands of Tennesseans and millions of Americans who will be trapped in collapsing Affordable Care Act exchanges with few or even zero options for health insurance in 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have increased under the ACA law ; 3 ) gradually giving states more flexibility on the Medicaid program , but doing this in a way that does not pull the rug out from under people who rely on Medicaid ; and 4 ) making sure those with pre-existing conditions have access to insurance .  -- Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn . <p>  For far too long Obamacare has hurt American families by not keeping its promises of lowering costs , while increasing patient choice . That is why I voted in favor of the American Healthcare Act . This bill will reduce premiums , stabilize the market , and ensure patient choice . While there is more work ahead to rebuild our broken healthcare system , passing this legislation was a critical first step . I look forward to collaborating with my Senate colleagues to give the American people the healthcare they deserve .  -- Rep. Chuck Fleischmann , R-Tenn . <p>  We 're helping President Trump to fulfill his promise to the American people , suffering under Obamacare . In Tennessee , my constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many have no choice of coverage at all . Allowing Obamacare to stand is not an option , and I 'm glad we were able to strike the worst of its regulations from the first version of this legislation . Now it 's time for the Senate to do its work and help us deliver the President a bill to sign .  -- Rep. Scott DesJarlais , R-Tenn . <p>  I voted against Trumpcare today because it is harmful to the average American and will result in people dying because they do n't have access to quality , affordable health insurance . Trumpcare is a wealth care bill , not a health care bill . It puts politics over improving our health care system . This bill is an excuse to give the wealthiest Americans huge tax breaks and proceed towards more tax cuts for the rich in the future . It should be called the ' Ebenezer Scrooge Act ' because it enriches the wealthiest individuals and harms the less fortunate both fiscally and physically .  -- Rep. Steve Cohen , D-Tenn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress in 2010 was legislation to defund Obamacare . Over the last seven years , we kept fighting , we never gave up , and now we 're finally passing a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that will hit the desk of a president who will sign it . This is Phase 1 of the President Trump 's three phase healthcare plan . Taken together , the president 's plan will reduce health insurance premiums , increase access to care and put patients first .  -- Rep. Tom Graves , R-Ga . <p>  While today 's health care legislation falls short of the full ObamaCare repeal that I called for and believe in , a partial repeal does more good for working American families than no repeal at all . I am proud that diligent House Freedom Caucus work has forced amendments that converted substantial increases in health insurance premiums into substantial cuts in health insurance costs for tens of millions of Americans . The AHCA repeals roughly twenty ObamaCare taxes that have hurt job creators and cut take-home pay . The AHCA repeals the ObamaCare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberty .  -- Rep. Mo Brooks , Ala . <p> WASHINGTON -- Republicans are claiming a triumph by pushing their legislative centerpiece scuttling much of President Barack Obama 's health care law through the House . It was a perilous journey , and its Senate pathway will be at least as bumpy with little doubt the measure will change , assuming it survives . <p> Thursday 's 217-213 House passage -- with 20 GOP defections -- was preceded by several near-death experiences for the legislation , even though repealing Obama 's statute helped guide Donald Trump 's presidential run and multitudes of GOP congressional campaigns . <p> And that was in a chamber Republicans control 238-193 . Had just two additional Republicans voted  no ,  the measure would have lost because bills need majorities to pass . Now , Republicans must try maneuvering the measure through a Senate terrain that is different politically and procedurally from the House . <p>  We must manage expectations and remain focused on the art of the doable as we move forward ,  said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Republicans after the House vote . <p> The House bill would end the Obama law 's fines on people who do n't purchase policies and erase its taxes on health industry businesses and higher-earning people . It would dilute Obama 's consumer-friendly insurance coverage requirements , like letting states permit insurers to charge higher premiums for customers with pre-existing medical conditions . <p> The measure would replace Obama 's federal subsidies for lower-income insurance buyers with tax credits geared to consumers ' ages . And it would cut Medicaid , the health insurance program for the poor and disabled , including ending extra federal payments 31 states are accepting to expand Medicaid to cover more people . <p> The notoriously understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , lauded the House bill as  an important step  to erasing Obama 's law but left the door open to changes . <p>  Congress will continue to act on legislation to provide more choices and freedom in health care decisions ,  McConnell said . <p> The House bill was written by Republicans representing districts often drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , and many tend to reflect more pragmatic views than their House colleagues . <p> Several come from northeastern and Midwestern states with large numbers of low-income people receiving Medicaid . Many of the 31 states that accepted Obama 's expansion of that program are led by GOP governors , and senators have no interest in cutting their states ' funds and taking coverage away from voters . <p>  I 've already made clear that I do n't support the House bill as currently constructed ,  said Sen. Rob Portman , R-Ohio . He cited its Medicaid cuts , including for treating people with drug problems , and said he 'd make sure that  those who are impacted by this epidemic can continue to receive treatment .  <p> In March , Portman joined three other GOP senators in opposing Medicaid cuts in an early version of the House legislation . In a letter to McConnell , they wrote that the measure  does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families  who use the program . <p> Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its consequences .  She said there should be  no barrier for coverage  for people with pre-existing medical conditions and that the House 's tax credits  do not adequately take into account income levels  or regional differences in health costs . <p> Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , have opposed cutting federal money for Planned Parenthood . The House bill blocks federal payments for a year to the organization , which provides abortions but does n't use federal funds for them by law . <p> Other senators are also seeking changes . No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota is working on a plan to skew the bill 's tax subsidies more toward lower-income people . <p> States that did not expand Medicaid under Obama 's law are looking for additional funding for their programs . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , whose state did not enlarge Medicaid , said he would not back a health care bill  that rewards people for taking Medicaid expansion at the expense of those who did not .  <p> Then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky , former presidential candidates who seldom back away from fights and have already signaled they 're looking for changes . <p> The Republican edge in the Senate is just 52-48 . Using special rules , the Senate could pass its version of the bill with just 50 votes and rely on Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie . But that means they can lose just two GOP senators assuming Democrats uniformly oppose scrapping Obama 's signature domestic achievement . <p> Those same bylaws bar provisions that are n't chiefly aimed at federal spending or revenue , meaning some House language dealing strictly with policy changes could fall out . <p>  The Senate will now finish work on our bill , but will take the time to get it right ,  said Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , who chairs the Senate health committee .

18280948," Will Hurd Is the Future of the GOP* <p> HELOTES , Texas -- Drenched in yellow light and red fog , Robert Earl Keen scratches at his guitar and unloads the lyrics to his trademark anthem with several thousand boot-and-cowboy-hat-clad Texans howling along in delirium . This is the grand finale on a warm Saturday night at Floore 's Country Store , among the holy sites in the  Texas Country  music scene , and I 'm likely the only soul here who does n't know the words . Luckily , it 's not hard to catch on ; at the end of each of the eight stanzas , Keen and his mob of devotees belt out the line that made him famous around these parts : The road goes on forever , and the party never ends . <p> The song is n't especially deep or meaningful -- it 's the story of two small-town social misfits who fall in love , arrange a meeting with Cuban drug dealers , steal their money , then kill the lawman who catches them , only to end with Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benz -- but the chorus provides an ideal thematic backdrop for a meeting of my own . <p> Story Continued Below <p> Drifting amid the sea of bodies in the poorly lit pavilion is Will Hurd , the congressman who represents Texas ' behemoth 23rd District , which stretches from this suburb north of San Antonio , all the way to El Paso some eight hours west . Of the 36 congressional districts in Texas , 35 are safely controlled by Republicans or Democrats ; Hurd 's is the outlier . Not only is his district the biggest in the state -- encompassing 58,000 square miles , covering all or parts of 29 counties , and including 820 miles of U.S.-Mexico border -- it 's easily the most competitive , with both parties pumping millions of dollars into the 23rd every election cycle . Hurd has agreed to let me drive with him across his district ; over the next three days we will traverse infinite stretches of flat and long-forgotten highway , zigzagging between dusty outposts for discussions with constituents and local officials about issues as remote as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine for Hurd , who , as a Republican in a 71 percent Hispanic district , must wage what is essentially a continuous , day-in-and-day-out campaign to keep his job . Serendipitously , before we depart on this odyssey , he wants to acquaint me with the stylings of Robert Earl Keen . The road goes on forever , and the party never ends . <p> Hurd is a 6 ' 4  black guy at a country music concert ; he 's also a federal lawmaker who has become increasingly recognizable since winning his first term in 2014 . Yet he mostly succeeds in not standing out . Keen salutes him from the stage halfway through his set , and a bunch of attendees -- including two border patrol officers -- stop him for a handshake . Otherwise , Hurd keeps a low profile , singing to himself and dancing with his girlfriend , Lynlie Wallace , who serves as chief of staff to state Rep. Lyle Larson and is currently running for a seat on the San Antonio City Council . Hurd , who is just shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today lives a few miles from this venue -- close enough , he tells me after one of his staff members introduces us and hands me a Miller Lite from a red cooler , to hear these concerts from home .  Call me Will  is the first thing he says , which I dismiss as an aw-shucks tactic powerful people use to come across as everyday men . It 's not until our trip ends that I realize nobody along the way -- judges , construction workers , random constituents , his own staffers -- has called the congressman anything except  Will .  <p> The informality suits him : Hurd does n't go out of his way to impress people , as he himself is not easily impressed . His foray into electoral politics was inspired by briefings he conducted with congressional members while working as an undercover CIA operative in the Middle East . More than once he encountered lawmakers who did n't grasp basic facts about the region like the distinction between Sunni and Shia Muslims , and Hurd concluded that their constituents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my brother not to know the difference between Sunni and Shia ,  Hurd likes to say ,  because he sells cable for a living .  ) So he quit the agency after nearly a decade and came home , to Texas , launching a long-shot bid in 2010 . He won the most votes in the district 's Republican primary but lost the runoff . After retreating to the private sector -- utilizing his intelligence and technological expertise to make some serious money as a cybersecurity adviser -- he ran again in 2014 , this time winning the GOP nomination and defeating incumbent Democratic Congressman Pete Gallego by roughly 2,400 votes . The outcome surprised strategists in both parties ; Gallego , a Hispanic former lawyer , had represented much of the congressional district as a state lawmaker and was much better known in the area . Democrats felt certain they 'd win a rematch in 2016 with presidential-year turnout -- and that was before Trump won the GOP nomination . And yet somehow , despite Trump alienating Hispanics , despite Clinton winning the district by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2016 , Hurd won reelection , this time by just over 3,000 votes . <p> Democrats rationalize their defeat like this : The district is unfairly drawn to the GOP 's advantage ; Clinton failed to inspire low-propensity Hispanic voters ; Gallego did n't raise sufficient money or hustle hard enough . There is , however , another explanation : Hurd is a phenom . Republicans and Democrats who have witnessed his ascent say he possesses a rare combination of competence as a policymaker , responsiveness as a representative and ferocity as a campaigner . Consider that during his first term -- with Barack Obama , a Democrat , still occupying the White House -- Hurd authored more bills that were signed into law than any other member of Congress . ( Most are n't  sexy  bills of national interest , he says , but rather targeted toward his constituents , such as winning overtime pay for the Border Patrol . ) Meanwhile , the freshman lawmaker found time to systematically explore every parcel of his district , assemble a staff that quickly became known as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious sums of money to power a reelection bid that some in his party had privately written off . <p>  He 's a survivor . He 's always fought upstream ,  says James Aldrete , an Austin-based Democratic strategist who ran the Spanish-language media strategy for both Obama campaigns and Clinton 2016 .  To be an African-American Republican in Texas is very rare . And to win , and then win again in a presidential year , which typically would swing the seat back into our corner , and to win with Trump at the top of the ticket , who 's not being helpful to him , and he 's able to distance himself from Trump while increasing his margin of victory ...  Aldrete stops himself . He had pledged at the outset of our talk not to get carried away flattering Hurd on the record , and seemed disappointed in himself .  You 've just got to give him credit ,  Aldrete quietly concludes . <p> Republicans have no such qualms in gushing about his potential .  I 've been involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be worried about Will Hurd ,  says Texas GOP Chairman Tom Mechler .  The sky is the limit . This guy is incredible .  Of course , that 's what any state party chairman worth his salt should say about a member of his congressional delegation . But the plaudits being showered on Hurd are n't perfunctory -- and they 're not just originating in Texas . When I told Kevin Seifert , the political consigliore to Speaker Paul Ryan who is responsible for raising tens of millions of dollars to protect the House Republican majority , that I was traveling to southern Texas for this story , he replied ,  Will Hurd is my favorite member of Congress .  <p> Washington D.C. is talking about Will Hurd as a bonafide superstar who could represent the future of the Republican Party -- but first , he must continue to survive in one of America 's toughest congressional districts . Stephen Voss/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine <p> There 's little for Republicans not to like : Hurd is a young , eloquent , dark-skinned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks with an earned authority on national security . He is an intellectual asset to the party ; the efficiency-obsessed Hurd , who wants to build a  cyber National Guard  of young computer whizzes to protect the nation 's digital infrastructure , has been communicating with Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner , pitching projects for the White House 's new Office of American Innovation . But Hurd is also unafraid of bucking the GOP and the president himself , especially in the interest of his district . He denounced Trump during the campaign , distancing himself in particular from the candidate 's rhetoric about Mexican immigrants . He voted against Ryan 's health care bill in early May , knowing the toll it would take on the many poor , isolated constituents he represents . And he has emerged as perhaps the most vocal opponent of Trump 's plan to build a wall along the southern border , which he argues would hurt trade , send the wrong message and fail to keep out intruders . <p> Washington is talking about Hurd as a bonafide superstar who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , he must continue to survive in one of America 's toughest congressional districts . Not only do Democrats have a price on his head ; a federal court could redraw his district this summer to make it an even heavier demographic lift for Republicans . Hurd has already won twice under a map the court drew in 2013 , and insists he 's not worried --  Go ahead , redraw the maps ,  he says -- but voting patterns there suggest he should be concerned . <p>  If you look at the history of this district , every single incumbent has gotten beat . There 's not one member from this district that has ever retired because he or she wanted to ,  Gallego says , knowingly .  The same thing will happen to Will Hurd . It 's just a question of when .  <p> *** <p> We 're seated around an old wooden table in a small dining room in a simple , teal-colored house , one in a string of bungalows that line a working-class street in the northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in . His parents purchased it when he was a newborn nearly 40 years ago , and it was n't easy ; Bob Hurd , who worked as a traveling salesman -- and got used to being told ,  We do n't let n------ in here  as he approached pharmacy counters -- remembers the redlining practices that made buying a home a nightmare for a black man and his white wife in south Texas circa 1975 . They had invited me for Easter brunch before the congressman and I head west , and as we sit down to eat following some brief introductions , I lob a polite softball to jump-start the conversation :  What 's it like having your son in Congress ?  <p> Hurd 's mother , Mary Alice , does not hesitate .  It 's his problem , not mine ,  she says . I almost spit out my orange juice at the unexpected hilarity of her response . But maybe she 's not joking . Mary Alice is expressionless as she digs into her plate of scrambled eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurd 's mother is a quiet woman with a shy smile , shoulder-length silver hair framing her round , bespectacled face . It 's obvious that she is proud of her son -- framed photos and newspaper clippings adorn his old room -- but it 's equally obvious that politics are n't exactly part of the family 's DNA . The framed articles are from Texas A&amp;M 's student publication , The Battalion , marking his ascent to student body president and his time in office , yet there is no trace of his election and reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives . <p>  Your ass is crazy ,  Chuck Hurd recalls telling his brother when Will informed the family he was quitting the CIA to run for Congress after nine-and-a-half years as a covert operative . The Hurds were immensely proud of the dangerous and important work he was doing , and I got the distinct impression that they were less enamored of his political achievements . Chuck , the eldest of the three Hurd children -- their middle sister , Liz , is away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably 30 pounds heavier , built like a fullback and wearing a salt-and-pepper beard that makes him look the part of a blue-collar joe . ( Clearly familiar with his brother 's Sunni-Shia quip , Chuck tells me he does n't merely sell cable , but is a sales manager who supervises other employees . ) <p> If Chuck is straight out of central casting , so , too , is  William ,  as everyone here calls him . Tall and well-built with broad shoulders and enormous hands , the congressman has thinning black hair that is receding and meticulously combed back in small , slick waves . This feature , when combined with the rectangular glasses that tend to slip toward the tip of his nose and the slight under-bite he has owned since childhood , give him the distinguished appearance of an oil-painted parliamentarian , especially when glancing downward to read remarks or jot down thoughts in the mysterious red notebook he carries in his jacket everywhere he goes . <p> And yet Hurd does n't always act the part . He cusses casually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoned-down colleagues . He also talks with the slightest trace of a lisp from his childhood struggle with a speech impediment that had kids calling him  Hurd the Nerd ,  a nickname that still makes him shudder . (  Now I 'm 6 ' 4  , 235 pounds , spent nine-and-a-half years in the CIA , and nobody messes with me ,  he tells a lunchroom full of wide-eyed third-graders in Fort Stockton . ) <p> Will Hurd with his parents , Mary Alice and Chuck . Asked what it 's like having her son in Congress , Mary Alice does not hesitate :  It 's his problem , not mine .  Tim Alberta <p> Hurd swears this career was never in the cards . His parents were conservative people in a conservative part of a conservative state , but there was no cheerleading for either party or dinner-table discussions of electoral developments .  I would n't say political talk was a staple of our house growing up ,  he tells me after brunch , laughing . Bob Hurd , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tells me with a mischievous smirk that he likes to tell people he 's been a Republican  since Lincoln freed us ,  but it 's clear there was no ideological indoctrination in the Hurd household . His youngest son identified with the GOP by cultural osmosis more than anything else , and found himself voting that way in college despite having no core set of political principles ; his first presidential ballot , in 1996 , was cast for Bob Dole over Bill Clinton -- but only , Hurd says , because of Dole 's military service . <p> It 's hard to believe someone who ran for student body president did so without ideological conviction or future political aspiration . Hurd , however , insists he had neither . A computer-science major with a minor in international studies , he was set on attending Stanford only to fall in love with Texas A&amp;M during a visit . The reason : its commitment to public service . Hurd did n't join the corps of cadets , and he was n't politically active , but he threw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior , he decided to mount an unlikely bid for student body president . He and some friends hoped for buzz by painting hundreds of ping-pong balls with his campaign logo -- a black smile on a yellow face -- and dumping them into the campus fountain . But the balls washed into one corner and went unnoticed . Hurd decided at that point to try something different : meeting as many students as possible , one-on-one , especially those without a history of voting . It worked : He won the election with record-breaking voter turnout .  I learned there 's no substitute for personal engagement ,  he tells me . <p> There were more lessons ahead , but they came at a steep price . Hurd had just fallen asleep around 3:00 in the morning in November 1999 when the phone rang . It was a friend -- the older sister of his current chief of staff , Stoney Burke -- telling him something had happened at  Bonfire ,  the Texas A&amp;M tradition of building and burning a mountainous , wedding-cake-shaped structure of timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Texas . The logs had collapsed , killing 12 students on the construction crew and shattering the community . Hurd found himself thrust into the spotlight , speaking at a memorial service that same day and representing the school in national media interviews ranging from CNN to NPR . <p> He seems uncomfortable talking about the experience , particularly when I ask how it might have shaped his approach to leadership and politics . But it 's apparent that Hurd turned heads during that tragic period on campus . Bob Gates , the former CIA director and defense secretary , was serving as the interim dean of the university 's George Bush School of Government and Public Service in 1999 . He remembers being in awe of  Will 's leadership skills , comforting people , bringing people together at a very difficult time for the university .  When Gates learned that Hurd -- who was taking former CIA operative Jim Olson 's course ,  Cold War Rhetoric and Intelligence  -- was himself interested in joining the agency , they made a strong push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to be recruited ; he was young , had virtually no global experience and did n't even speak a second language . Yet Olson , who had taken his teaching job at the insistence of then-CIA Director George Tenet and former President George H.W. Bush , forcefully vouched for his pupil .  Because he was well-read , because of his interpersonal skills , his proven leadership ,  Olson remembers of the recommendation .  My job throughout my career was to evaluate and assess people . And Will just stood out .  <p> Gates and Olson were thrilled at Hurd 's recruitment , and through friends at the agency kept close tabs on their prized Aggie as he accepted dangerous assignments in Pakistan , Afghanistan , India and elsewhere . Hurd learned Urdu , grew several styles of beards , and with his ethnically ambiguous features managed to blend into -- and find his way out of -- lots of dangerous situations . The feedback was universally glowing : Hurd was headed for a corner office at the CIA , and quickly .  He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .  I had more than one conversation with people at the top  -- he pauses --  They were very much aware of him .  Olson , for his part , says Hurd  had the potential to lead the organization in a very senior position .  <p> Gates and Olson , along with Hurd 's CIA colleagues , were stunned and disappointed by his departure -- especially when they learned it was for a congressional run . They were n't alone .  He could have done anything he wanted ,  Chuck Hurd tells me .  And he went from dealing with one set of terrorists and thieves to dealing with another set of terrorists and thieves .  ( The skill-set translates , as I learned when tracking Hurd off the House floor after his vote against the American Health Care Act . Seeing him on the phone but wanting a comment , I trailed him at a short distance as he weaved down a series of spiral staircases . He was five feet in front of me as we entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom -- poof -- he was gone . ) <p> The shock of Hurd 's career change did n't stop Chuck from being his brother 's most active campaign volunteer . ( Will still chides him for not knowing what a primary was . ) And it did n't stop Gates from doing something he had never done .  Will is the only person I have ever formally endorsed -- period ,  he tells me . When I ask about Hurd 's potential , and the GOP 's high expectations for him , Gates does n't mask his own .  I have served eight presidents over a 50-year period ,  he says , chuckling .  And I think it 's premature , but what I would say is he has the character and the integrity and the leadership skills for higher office .  <p> Mary Alice Hurd is less vague . More surprising than her earlier response is what she tells me when I ask where she expects her son to be in 10 or 15 years .  President ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have stately feet , Sir .  <p> One day later , Hurd ca n't decide whether to remove his shoes . The 23rd District looks like a deformed alligator whose wide-open jaws are chomping down on San Antonio from the west ; we 've traveled from its eyeball into its belly , the Monahans Sandhills State Park , where Hurd is shooting a video promoting the rolling dunes as a family vacation destination . Everything goes smoothly until Hurd reaches the scene where he 'll slide down a dune on a green plastic saucer . Walking across sand in expensive dress shoes is n't a great option -- just ask Richard Nixon -- and neither is going barefoot . ( Congressmen do have their dignity , after all . ) But with a reporter watching -- and Park Ranger Michael Smith promising no podiatric judgment -- he ca n't turn back . Hurd takes off his socks and shoes , steps onto the hot khaki sand , mumbles about his  fat ass  keeping the vehicle stationary and trudges to the top . His muttering proves prescient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't budge . ( The ranger shouts that it 's the hot , sticky sand , then winks at me . ) No matter . The shoot is a hit and Ranger Smith is ecstatic about the free publicity . <p> Of course , the park is n't all Hurd is promoting . As a sophomore lawmaker who prior to running for Congress had never stepped foot in most of this district , shoeless or otherwise , Hurd is playing catch-up . One smart technique is to constantly advertise his visits via social media . On Sunday evening , he posts from Lum 's BBQ in Junction ( population : 2,472 ) , from a Davey Crockett statue he pulled off the highway to see in Ozona ( population : 3,225 ) and then from a Dairy Queen just down the road . Hurd 's preferred app is SnapChat ; he controls the  HurdOnTheHill  account entirely from his personal phone . He posts roughly a third of his own Instagram photos , while his staff handles his accounts on Twitter and Facebook . This system allows Hurd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial posts ; constituents are happy because their schools and towns and businesses get free exposure , and Hurd is happy because he is engaging constituents every day who he otherwise might never reach . <p>  You can tell when it 's just a bullshit handshake from a politician , and that 's not him ,  says Ruben Falcon , a Clinton-Hurd voter . Tim Alberta <p> The 23rd District poses unique challenges as a political constituency ; its raw size makes true representation almost impossible . For Hurd , the overwhelming Hispanic population would seem especially problematic -- he does n't speak Spanish , and does n't plan to learn it -- but he says the bigger obstacle was transcending the district 's urban-rural divide . Having grown up in Bexar ( pronounced  Bear  ) County , home of metropolitan San Antonio , Hurd learned quickly in his first campaign that West Texans resented anyone from  the big city  barging into their towns without proper humility .  I had to learn to leave my suit at the Bexar County line ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Hurd won in 2016 based on his dominance in Bexar County , where he topped Gallego by 14,000 votes . Democrats point out that Hurd lost the Hispanic vote district-wide , and rightly argue he would not have won without the Republican-heavy San Antonio suburbs . Hurd , though , won 18 of the other 28 counties that are part of the district , which suggests he has n't simply catered to college-educated whites . He ca n't afford to : With Hispanics growing daily as a share of his voting-age constituency , and Trump proving historically unpopular early in his first term , Hurd must distance himself from the president and broaden his appeal in non-conservative precincts . <p>  There are a lot of second-generation people in this district , second-generation Hispanic immigrants who vote a straight Democratic ticket ,  says Ruben Falcon , a councilman in Fort Stockton who is also the city 's former mayor and owner of Bienvenidos , Hurd 's favorite restaurant in the district . Falcon says he voted for both Clinton and Hurd last November , and believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could threaten his career .  You can tell when it 's just a bullshit handshake from a politician , and that 's not him ,  Falcon says .  I think the thing that will save Will from the Trump haters is that he 's out here so much , making all these connections in these communities .  <p> In truth , Hurd has no choice . To survive here is to pursue every voter . That 's why we started the day in Monahans ( population : 7,617 ) , then headed to Pecos ( population : 9,213 ) before driving back to Fort Stockton ( population : 8,482 ) , where we stayed the night before and which , with its thousands of hotel rooms , is known as the premier rest-and-refuel stop for anyone traversing these parts of Texas . Representing such far-flung , isolated areas can be torture for a politician ; it also can be strangely rewarding . Hurd lights up when he talks about Loving County , which , with 95 residents ( at last unofficial count ) , stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a safely Republican area but Hurd was an unknown commodity when he first ventured there .  I 've met all but 18 of them ,  he tells me .  And those 18 people do n't want to be met .  Hurd won 30 of the 40 votes cast there in 2014 , and 54 of its 64 votes two years later . <p>  He is a hard worker . He is extremely conscientious ,  Ciro Rodriguez , the former Democratic congressman who represented the district from 2007 to 2011 , says of Hurd .  I would disagree with him on his priorities and goals and objectives , but you have to admit , he 's a hard worker and he moves around and he 's responsive . He does all the right things from that perspective . Whoever runs against him has to match that .  <p> Democrats are well aware . Fed up with Gallego after his back-to-back losses and alleged lethargy compared to Hurd , they are turning to fresh faces . San Antonio federal prosecutor Jay Hulings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary could get crowded , especially if a friendlier map emerges . Emily 's List , the powerhouse pro-abortion-rights group that recruits female candidates , is said to be zeroing in on Judy Canales , a former Obama appointee who lives in Eagle Pass , as well as a mystery combat veteran from San Antonio . <p> Hard work is indeed necessary to win and protect a coin-flip district , but so too is the discipline -- at least rhetorically -- never to stray far from the middle of the electorate . Hurd , who is probably the least ideological politician I 've ever met , had no trouble mastering this talent . At a roundtable with local officials in Monahans , Hurd emphasizes , as he does everywhere , that border security is a priority -- but adds that building a wall is the  most expensive and least effective  way to achieve it . He strikes a disapproving tone on the Affordable Care Act , but tells them to  forget about the labels  of  repeal and replace  and says the only things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It came as little surprise nearly three weeks later when he voted against Ryan 's legislation ; Hurd staffers told me that day the office got hundreds of phone calls and only one was in favor . ) And when asked about recent foreign policy developments , Hurd says he supported Trump 's missile strike in Syria -- but speaks in cautionary tones about any American military intervention , especially on the Korean Peninsula , warning that North Korea has  the largest special forces in the world  and a leader who possesses  the capability and willingness to kill millions of people  across the border in South Korea . <p> Some of this , certainly , owes to Hurd 's natural pragmatism and nuance . But he 's also walking a tightrope at all times -- and he knows it . The clearest ( and funniest ) example of this comes later Monday afternoon when , after a speech to a few dozen high school students in Pecos , Hurd asks for questions  on the CIA , Congress , robotics , anything .  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came in wearing a ' Make America Great Again ' hat .  What do you think about sanctuary cities ?  he asks . Hurd grimaces .  You 've got to enforce the law . It 's that simple ,  he replies . Then , without so much as blinking , Hurd adds :  Let 's talk about robotics .  <p> Hurd 's obsession with cultivating a centrist brand explains the now-famous  road trip  from San Antonio to Washington he took in March with Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke , who represents the neighboring district anchored in El Paso . It was fascinating not simply for the display of bipartisanship , but for the organically funny banter between two young politicians so eager to be perceived as moderates that they jumped in the car without necessarily expecting they would come to genuinely admire one another after 30 hours together with thousands of people watching via livestream .  Will 's a great member of Congress ,  O'Rourke said to the camera at one point .  And if I just allowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work together , I would n't be spending any time with him .  <p> Of course , this was a fuzzy sentiment wrapped in political calculation . The trip was O'Rourke 's idea , and within weeks he had launched his Senate campaign against GOP incumbent Ted Cruz ; naturally he used the adventure with Hurd to sow narratives of his centrist inclinations and contrast them against his polarizing right-wing opponent . Cruz allies were somewhat annoyed , but Hurd laughs at the suggestion that he might have unwittingly aided O'Rourke 's effort to unseat his fellow Republican .  Look , a Democrat in Texas is n't going to win a statewide election -- period ,  he says .  Did you tell Beto that ?  I ask . Hurd grins .  He knows my opinion .  <p> I did n't find one Republican complaining about Hurd helping O'Rourke . But a number of Democrats -- who agree that Cruz ca n't be beaten -- privately grumbled about O'Rourke boosting the bipartisan bonafides of someone they have a better chance of unseating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in future statewide and perhaps even national elections . The road trip , skeptics in both parties say , was more about campaign strategy than congressional bipartisanship . We all know what Beto O'Rourke got out of it . What about Will Hurd ? <p> *** <p> Two unusual things strike me about the Texas congressman . The first is that he employs numerous staff members who are n't Republicans . His military and veteran caseworker , Jon , who lost a leg in Iraq ( and has a wicked sense of humor about it ) is n't shy about denouncing the party . His district staffer , Jenny , who drove with us from San Antonio , smiles and shakes her head no when I ask if she 's a Republican . And his chief of staff , Stoney Burke , whom Hurd counts among his best friends and says will be  the only chief I 'll ever have ,  used to work for Democrat Chet Edwards . When I ask Hurd about this , he looks surprised . Then he shrugs .  Your office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says .  So it 's not a requirement .  <p> Hard work is indeed necessary to win and protect a coin-flip district , but so too is the discipline -- at least rhetorically -- never to stray far from the middle of the electorate . Getty Images ; Tim Alberta <p> The second is that Hurd has no rehearsed answer to one of the easiest questions for a politician . After our thoroughly conviction-free discussion of how he came to identify as a Republican , I ask him which political figures were his inspirations and influences . This is a robotic answer for most everyone in his party : Ronald Reagan . And yet Hurd , despite growing up during the 1980s , struggles to produce a response . Finally , he settles on two figures : Teddy Roosevelt and George Washington . Solid choices , to be sure ; they 're half of Mt . Rushmore . But neither governed in the past century nor preached any sort of ideology that translates to today 's political scene . <p> If anything , Hurdseems fundamentally distrustful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to the treatment of women , minorities , gays , poor people and other groups . Its worst tendencies , he seems to believe , are embodied by Trump -- which is maddening given they will share a ballot for the foreseeable future .  Do I have control over what he says ? No ,  Hurd says .  Do I have to talk that way ? No . And I 'm not going to .  <p> In some sense , Hurd 's high-profile stand against the border wall is n't just about the wall itself . Yes , he passionately believes that a  virtual barrier  -- cutting-edged fiber optic cables and high-definition cameras complimenting a few urban stretches of see-through fence , all monitored by a beefed up border-patrol monitoring the border -- is a wiser use of money and a better way to protect the homeland . But he 's not entirely unique in this regard ; most Texas Republicans oppose Trump 's sweeping proposal on the border .  Not even Ted Cruz , who is an idiot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall in Texas ,  Rodriguez tells me . <p> Hurd 's fight against the wall is sincere , but it doubles as a symbolic show of defiance against a president whose rhetoric offends his constituents and whose policies on immigration and NAFTA threaten their livelihoods in a region where the flow of people and goods underpins the economy . ( To drive this point home , Hurd 's staff arranges a trip across the border to Ju ? rez on my final day in the district . We visit a technology incubator where American teenagers are working alongside their Mexican counterparts on computer chips and Hurd , both a science geek and a promoter of international commerce , ca n't hide his satisfaction . ) <p> At one point , driving along a barren freeway with oil rigs toiling to our right , I ask Hurd how he can reconcile his approach with that of Trump , the leader of his party .  Well , he 's amember of the party ,  Hurd says .  Just because somebody is in my party does n't mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . Yes , he 's the titular head of the party . But he 's just one person . And I completely disagree with people who say he 's the standard-bearer . There 's a lot of people that represent the Republican brand and conservatism .  <p> But does n't Trump speak for the party , I ask ?  Shit , I do n't know ,  Hurd says .  My thing is this : sphere of influence , sphere of control . What do I have control over ? I have control over my actions and being an example to people . So that 's what I spend time on . What does that mean for the broader party ?  He takes another pause .  I look to good examples in the party , people like John Cornyn . That guy is really a great example of someone that people should grow up to be like .  <p> It 's an intriguing answer , because some people think Cornyn -- the senior senator from Texas , the more moderate counterpart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly who Hurd wants to grow up to be like . Whether Cornyn retires in 2020 or seeks another six-year term is the subject of intensifying speculation back home . If he leaves , Hurd could very well be his preferred successor . But this is where the tightrope routine could backfire : Texas is loaded with ambitious conservatives who are circling any open statewide office like vultures , and Hurd has cut such a moderate profile to survive in his own district that he might be rendered unacceptable to the right in a Republican primary . <p>  That definitely affects his ability to run statewide ,  says C ? sar Blanco , a Democratic state representative who formerly served as chief of staff to both Gallego and Rodriguez , and who is widely expected to run for O'Rourke 's seat . Aldrete , the Obama and Clinton alum , says his party can only hope that conservatives crowd Hurd out of future races .  The fact that he 's stymied because of them would be very helpful to Democrats .  <p> Hurd is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicapping of his future .  Coynyn 's my boy . I 've learned a lot from him ,  he says .  He 's been incredibly helpful . And I think he 's been underappreciated . ... But I 'm not plotting chess pieces . I evaluate opportunities as they arise .  <p>  Remember , everybody in Texas used to be Democrats ,  he says .  The tug-of-war will be over the center .  Tim Alberta <p> He 's clearly thinking ahead , though . At one point , Hurd engages me in a long conversation about demographics and my experience covering the presidential campaign in key primary states . To the extent he 's making long-term chess moves , they are based on where the party -- and his state -- will be . And here 's where Hurd hints at larger aspirations , arguing that the state 's demographic transformation will produce a demand for more mainstream politicians .  Remember , everybody in Texas used to be Democrats ,  he says .  The tug-of-war will be over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are around the center -- 40 percent left of center , 40 percent right of center -- and they 're all persuadable .  A minute later , Hurd adds ,  I just do n't accept the premise that to win a primary you have to be the person furthest to the right .  <p> He appears certain to test it sooner or later . Hurd is too young , too talented , too ambitious not to push the limits and enter the arena with bigger and better competition . But first , he has to hang onto the toughest seat in Texas , one of the toughest in America , where Democrats will continue to invest millions of dollars in hopes of taking it back and kneecapping his rapid ascent inside the Republican Party . Hurd , whose twin goals in Congress are to be a leader on national security and  the gold standard in constituent services ,  is growing more confident every single day , with every new social media post and every new voter he meets , that this district belongs to him .

18281899," To Understand the Cost of the War on Women , Look to Mississippi <h> This film about reproductive rights has never been more relevant . <p> April , a 24-year-old single mother and a central character in  Jackson ,  prepares for the birth of her fifth child.Jackson Documentary/Maisie Crow <p> Few policy areas have been so strongly affected by the first 100 days of the Donald Trump administration as women 's health care and access to reproductive services . Trump promised he would launch an all-out offensive against abortion access protections and organizations like Planned Parenthood , and the Republican Congress has begun the process . Across the country , emboldened anti-abortion state legislatures have tried to pass a new wave of abortion restrictions . <p> But in Mississippi , extensive abortion restrictions have been on the books for years . It 's one of a handful of states with only one operating abortion clinic -- the Jackson Women 's Health Organization , which Mississippi conservatives have fought to close -- leaving thousands of women , particularly low-income women of color , with limited access to services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen crisis pregnancy centers , which offer nonmedical services and counsel women against having an abortion . A new crisis pregnancy center opened right across the street from the clinic late last month . <p> There was a time when what was happening in Mississippi was seen as unique . Now women across the country fear their state could be next . <p> Enter Jackson , an award-winning documentary highlighting the realities of living in a state seeking to eliminate abortion access . Released on the festival circuit last June and broadcast nationally on Showtime earlier this week ( Showtime Showcase will rebroadcast the film on Friday , and it is now available on demand ) , the documentary offers an intimate look into the lives of three women : Shannon Brewer , the director of the Jackson Women 's Health Organization ; April , a 24-year-old single mother of four who 's facing an unplanned pregnancy ; and Barbara Beavers , the executive director of the pro-life Center for Pregnancy Choices , a Jackson-based crisis pregnancy center . In following the often intersecting lives of its subjects , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic , but also explores what life can be like in a state with few options . Filmed over three years and drawing from more than 700 hours of footage , Crow deftly connects the women 's stories to one another and to developments at the state and national levels and gives viewers an opportunity to understand the people caught up in the fight for reproductive rights . <p> Mother Jones caught up with Crow shortly before Jackson 's national broadcast premiere to discuss how audiences have reacted to the film , what it was like to spend years working with the documentary 's subjects , and what the film means at a time when access to abortion is under an increased threat . <p> Mother Jones : How would you describe this documentary to someone , and how did you decide you wanted to make it ? <p> Maisie Crow:Jackson is a film about the anti-abortion movement 's efforts to dissemble and take apart access to abortion in Mississippi and really across the Deep South . And now it really rings true across the country.In 2012 , I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had just been signed by Gov . Phil Bryant . I was shocked -- I grew up in Corpus Christi , Texas , and at the time there was an abortion clinic there . For as much as I knew , there were abortion clinics in every city . To realize there was a state with one abortion clinic and there was a law that could close it down , I was totally shocked . I went down to Mississippi shortly after reading that article . <p> Over time , I built really strong connections with the clinic , including Shannon Brewer the director of the Jackson Women 's Health Organization and Dr. Willie Parker who was providing abortion care there at the time . I spent a lot of time getting to know them , and then I made a short film called The Last Clinic ( released in 2013 ) . And it was in making that film that I realized I wanted to tell a larger story and weave in the anti-abortion movement in Mississippi and what they were doing to block access for women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Shannon and April -- are African American . I 've done some writing about the unique complexities women of color , particularly black women , face when it comes to accessing abortion care . It 's not just economics ; there 's a very specific type of shame that black women can feel for even considering an abortion . How did you navigate telling those stories ? <p> MC : Being a woman who is not from Mississippi , who did not grow up in those circumstances , and who is not a woman of color , I really relied on Shannon to help me understand what that experience was like . I paid careful and close attention to make sure that I was telling Shannon and April 's story in the best and most honest way possible because it was not my experience and so many problems can arise from that . <p> MJ : How did you first come in contact with April and begin working with her ? She seems to be a remarkable example of an everyday woman 's experience in the state . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her experience is an everyday woman 's experience because we all have vastly different experiences in life and health care . But once I met Barbara and started filming Barbara , I knew I had to tell the story of a woman who sought care at Barbara 's crisis pregnancy center , and that is where I met April . The day or two after I met April -- I was at her house doing an interview -- she told me she had consumed Clorox to terminate a pregnancy . In the film , that 's revealed during a counseling session at the crisis pregnancy center . That was the moment where I was like , this is really scary -- for women to feel like they have to resort to drinking bleach because they do n't want to be pregnant . That was something that could n't be left out of a film about access to abortion care . <p> Women 's choices should be their choices no matter what their situation in life . I want women to be educated on what their choices are . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what their options are , not because they 're not smart but because they have n't been given that knowledge or they 've been misled -- that 's alarming to me . <p> I really felt April 's experience was vital in terms of understanding how these laws and these crisis pregnancy centers and the stigma , how those things work together to affect a woman . April 's story is unique to her , but there are certainly other women that have experienced similar things , whether it 's multiple unwanted pregnancies without access to contraceptives or accurate information about abortion . After the screening in Jackson , Mississippi , several women came up and said ,  Thank you for making this . I 've been to that same crisis pregnancy center and I felt the same shame that April felt .  <p> MJ : So , as you 're talking to one woman of color in charge of Mississippi 's only clinic with abortion services and another woman of color navigating a very difficult pregnancy , you are also interacting with Barbara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you with her side of the story going into this ? <p> MC : I was probably most familiar with Barbara 's perspective . I grew up in South Texas . I grew up more in the pro-life movement and the conservative mindset than the liberal community that I am part of now . So that gave me unique insight into Barbara 's world , and I think that helped me understand her and get good access . <p> MJ : A typical documentary about abortion access often follows a woman who is certain she wants an abortion through the gauntlet she has to go through -- from the informed-consent information many states require doctors to distribute , to the often required ultrasound and the mandatory waiting period -- before she can get the procedure . Why is n't that the main story in Jackson ? <p> MC : It is important for that voice to be portrayed , but what I felt was missing in the overall discussion was the complexity , the nuance , the gray areas that exist in places , especially in the Deep South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with abortion . That tends to influence some of the decision-making . So you might have a woman that does n't want to be pregnant , who is not being given access to contraceptives , who has not been advised properly on contraceptive use . She does n't want to be pregnant , but she feels like she has no options . What is that experience like ? That is what I was trying to understand because when I got down to Mississippi I realized that it was not cut and dry . <p> Photo Courtesy of Maisie Crow <p> MJ : What was it like for you to film both sides of this issue ? <p> MC : It was weird . You 're filming both sides of this super contentious issue and there are a lot of emotions and passions in it . As a woman I have my own beliefs , I certainly do n't try to set those aside or remove them because it has to do with my health care as well . But I worked to not necessarily let that get in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MJ : This film is having its national broadcast premiere during a very intense political moment when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion access . How does your film fit into all that ? <p> MC : I am glad that the film exists at this point in time because I think it is a really scary moment for reproductive rights and access to reproductive health care . I think that this film helps people understand the different issues that are woven into a women 's ability to access reproductive health care . I hope it really sparks some discussions . We 've seen at festivals that audiences are really engaged and want to talk about these issues . There is so much to say and so much to talk about and it is my hope that the film sparks these discussions and people can continue them in their communities . <p> MJ:Jackson has been on the festival circuit for several months now , and it was screened both before and after the Supreme Court 's decision in Whole Woman 's Health v. Hellerstedt , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film changed in the months since its first screening ? <p> MC : Of course ! Prior to the election , I think there was a sense of confidence that things were changing and that this country was becoming more progressive and that women 's rights were being treated more fairly in regards to health care . The reaction used to be ,  Oh , look at what 's happening in Mississippi .  Or  Oh , it 's too bad that 's happening in Mississippi .  Or  What can we do to change what is happening in Mississippi ?  Now it 's  Oh my God , this is happening in my backyard .  People are really alarmed . <p> There 's a moment in the film where Dr. Parker is standing in front of the Supreme Court steps and he says ,  In November , vote as if women 's lives depended on it because they will .  We partnered with Planned Parenthood for a screening that had been planned before the election but did n't happen until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could hear people crying at that part .

@@18281930 <h> The Uncertain Future of Vaccines <h> An interview with journalist Meredith Wadman . <h> May 5 , 2017 <p> In 1962 , an anonymous woman had an abortion in Sweden . After the procedure , the fetus was taken , without the woman 's knowledge , to be used for medical research . It was first brought to the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , where it was dissected . Then , the lungs were sent to the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , where a young biologist named Leonard Hayflick used them in what became a momentous medical breakthrough . The cell line derived from the issue , WI-38 , was used to make the measles , rubella , adenovirus , varicella , and rabies virus vaccines . <p> In her sweeping new book , The Vaccine Race : Science , Politics , and the Human Costs of Defeating Disease , physician and journalist Meredith Wadman tells the story of the early days of vaccinology , while focusing an unflinching eye on the troubled history that gave rise to some of our greatest medical achievements . <p> Wadman spoke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their uncertain future under a president who has sympathized with the anti-vaccine movement . <p> Why do you believe this story needed to be told ? <p> I stumbled on a letter to the editor in Science Magazine . It had been prompted because there had been a lot of attention on the HeLa cells . The book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks involves these cancer cells that were taken without her knowledge from a dying African-American woman in 1951 , became a tremendously important tool in medical research . <p> And so this letter to the editor came in from a scientist named Leonard Hayflick . And he said ,  You know , the HeLa cells are getting all this attention around property rights and tissues , and whether people should be compensated when medical researchers use their leftover bits and pieces from surgery and turn them into lucrative inventions or medicine . But guess what , I derived this cell line called WI-38 back in 1962 . And it has been used to make vaccines that have protected hundreds of millions of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetus , and those cells became the subject of a big intellectual property fight and lawsuits between myself and the National Institutes of Health in the mid 1970s .  And I read this letter and I thought , this is fascinating . How has a book not been written about this ? <p> And Mrs. X , whose aborted fetus gave rise to the WI-38 cells that are at the heart of the book and have been used to make so many vaccines -- she never got credit . She was told only when researchers had to tell her that they 'd used her fetus , several months after the fact . They went back to get her medical history to make sure that cells were clean and not infected and safe for vaccine making . So that 's how she learned . And she obviously never received a penny , like the Lacks family . Those are important object lessons . We need to make sure that that does n't happen . <p> I want to talk a little bit about changes in patent laws , specifically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patenting of living organisms . And then following close after that the Bayh-Dole Act , which gave universities the power to patent their inventions that were funded by the government . How has the biotech industry changed because of those changes in patent laws ? <p> Yeah , well the industry was virtually created by the combination of the Bayh-Dole Act and the Chakrabarty decision , because suddenly university researchers were incentivized to commercialize their inventions because part of Bayh-Dole said , not only can the university have title in this , but as a condition of that they have to direct some of the proceeds back to the individual researcher personally . That was attractive . So researchers were asked to do this 180 degree reorientation : they went from ,  you should only work for the greater good in science ,  and then they were asked to suddenly become scouts for the next commercial opportunity . Today it 's like sort of a badge of honor if you 're out there spinning off a company based on your  university-funded research .  <p>  Researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater good in science , ' and then they were asked to suddenly become scouts for the next commercial opportunity .  <p> I was aware of the much more lax ethical standards in science 50-60 years ago , but I was n't aware of some of the horrors that you reveal in your book -- I mean , experiments on the disabled , orphans , prisoners , newborns . What were some of the most surprising things you learned ? <p> I can tell you I was just as surprised as you . I knew that there had been Tuskegee , and some human radiation experiments , or even the Guatemala studies that were revealed a few years ago . But I did n't realize that those were not particularly exceptional . I mean they were heinous examples , but this use of people who were powerless not to consent was common throughout medical research . And not common in the sort of outliers group , but among esteemed scientists , people like Jonas Salk who , largely from WWII to the mid ' 60s and even in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you describe . <p> So I learned that the rubella vaccine that has protected US infants since 1979 was developed in an orphanage on 1- and 2-year-old toddlers . They were tested . The first time this vaccine was put in human beings was in these orphans , parentless infants . The NIH funded these experiments . Major hospitals conducted them . Eyebrows were not raised . This was normal . <p> So it 's terribly sobering and you look back and think , how did this happen ? And you wonder in 30 , 40 , 50 years down the road for us what are people going to be looking back at and saying , how was this allowed ? <p> In the past few years there 's been an uptick in anti-vaccine rhetoric . Where is this coming from ? Are you worried about the future of vaccines in America ? <p> Yes , I am . And I think it 's coming from a vocal minority that 's feeling empowered by the current occupant of the White House and the general political atmosphere in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victim of their own success . You do not see the diseases that they protect against precisely because we vaccinate against these diseases . So young parents are not seeing children in iron lungs with polio . They do n't know people who just lost a toddler to diphtheria or to measles when it invaded the toddler 's young lungs and caused pneumonia . The fear factor is n't there . <p> And then there is the really false and incredibly damaging paper in 1998 that was retracted by The Lancet that claimed that the measles , mumps , rubella vaccine , in particular , caused autism . It has been roundly debunked . But that has taken root as a sort of alternative fact . It 's terribly problematic , not only because those people 's children are not protected but because that then sets an example for parents who may not be dug in and totally opposed to vaccines . They 're called vaccine-hesitant parents . They see the non-vaxxers ' kids and think , well if they 're not getting sick , then it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 90 percent -- or even 95 percent , with a wildly contagious disease like measles -- in terms of vaccination coverage , and you get into serious problems . <p>  They see the non-vaxxers ' kids and think , well if they 're not getting sick , then it 's probably safe for my kid .  <p> I think it 's really , really important to respond , yes with emotion , but primarily with evidence and with education . And I think the most effective venue for that is in a pediatrician 's office . I do n't think sort of water cooler arguments or cocktail party arguments between anti-vaxxers and vaxxers will do anyone any good . It 's sad to think , but I hope it does n't take some really horrible outbreak to push the hesitant into the vaccinating camp . <p> We 've all but eradicated many of these diseases , but if vaccination rates dip low enough , is a countrywide outbreak still possible ? <p> Yes , it 's definitely possible again if vaccine rates dip low enough . Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really strong response to the anti-vaxxers . Measles in particular , because it 's so contagious . And it 's no joke . A healthy kid might have the rash and be miserable , but for a kid with leukemia or some kind of immune deficiency , measles is often a deadly event for them . That 's the end . Pregnancies too , I mean stillbirths , miscarriages can happen if moms get the measles . I 'm informed partly by watching toddlers die in South Africa , when I was in medical school , for lack of a measles vaccine , because when they 're sick it invades their lungs and they die of pneumonia . So I remember those bad old days from having worked in Africa , but I 'm sure that elderly people remember the bad old days from this country . <p> The administration has walked back some of its anti-vaccination comments , but the climate research field has n't been so lucky . There have been reports of rogue scientists working night and day to protect precious climate data against Trump . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're trying to protect in terms of climate science is all on EPA and other government servers , and so it 's on government websites , and it 's been accumulated by government research agencies . But the vaccine scene would be a bit different because the trials conducted and the data would all be in the medical literature which is not controlled in the same way that say the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website , that has gathered temperature data for decades , is . So I do n't know that preserving data is going to be a threat to the vaccine community or community of vaccine scientists . I think it 's more a battle for hearts and minds . That 's going to be where this is being fought .

@@18281932 <p> As Phil Murphy , the ex-Goldman Sachs banker , continues to fill out his profile as a liberal candidate for governor , one thing has become clear : He 's not afraid of uttering the dreaded t-word . <p> Murphy , a Democrat running for his first elected office , has endorsed raising taxes on millionaires . He supports taxing the sale of marijuana , assuming it becomes legal by passing the Legislature now controlled by Democrats . Murphy figures it could potentially raise $300 million in revenue . <p> And on Thursday , Murphy expressed a willingness to consider imposing some sort of broad-based tax dedicated to mass transit funding . <p>  There are a number of things on the table ,  Murphy said in a news conference outside the Trenton train station . <p> Murphy has spent the unusually long slog of a campaign -- he formally entered the race a year ago -- defining himself as a kind of progressive , new century champion of the middle class . <p> Yet in many ways , he 's a old school tax-and-spend Democrat . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as he did Thursday , at least openly consider tax increases during a New Jersey statewide campaign . <p> Murphy , 59 , is a Democrat that is no longer haunted by the tax revolt of 1991 , when voters , furious over then-Gov . Jim Florio 's historic $2.8 billion in tax hikes , purged scores of Democrats from the Legislature . Two years later , Florio was turned out of office . <p> That trauma did n't entirely stop passage of tax hikes -- former Gov . Jim McGreevey pushed through a corporate tax hike and a slew of fee hikes , and former Gov . Jon Corzine 's battle to boost the sales tax by 1 cent led to a brief government shutdown in 2006 . But no Democratic candidate has so openly campaigned on the possibility of raising taxes like Murphy . <p> There are several reasons why . For one thing , Murphy has promised the Democratic Party voters an almost pain-free future , in which the state meets its annual obligation to fund the pension system , a cost that will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , Murphy says he intends to fully meet the Supreme Court-approved formula for public school districts for the first time in a decade -- a promise that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars . He promises to expand programs for pre-schoolers . <p> With the state up to its neck in debt , the only way to cover this ambitious price-tag is to hope that the economy continues its rebound -- and to raise taxes . <p> The Democratic Party activists who dominate the primary -- especially public employee unions -- welcome the idea of tax increases with open arms . In fact , the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a millionaire 's tax five times , only to have them vetoed by Gov . Chris Christie . <p> Christie , who opposed most new tax hikes during his tenure , has began warning Republican allies that Democrats would try to raise taxes if they succeeded him as governor . He called them  animals at the gate  who are waiting to get your money and I 'm the only one left at the gate saying no , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of anti-tax rhetoric may not have the same resonance with voters who have seen little progress in some of the state 's chronic fiscal problems under Christie 's watch . More voters are more willing to view tax hikes as a necessary evil , recent polling suggests . <p> A Quinnipiac University poll in March found that most voters still oppose a broad-based tax to finance the state 's ailing pension system . But it also found that 7 out of 10 surveyed supported raising taxes on millionaires to bolster pensions . <p> Yet , one unknown is whether voters are willing to swallow another tax hike for transit issues now that they are paying higher prices at the pump after a 23-cent hike in motor fuel taxes . That hike was included as part of a  tax fairness  deal Christie brokered with Democratic leaders last September . <p> That money will replenish the Transportation Trust Fund for road and bridge projects . The trust fund also will subsidize New Jersey Transit , which has relied mostly on a Rob-Peter-to-Pay-Paul strategy of stopgap funding under Christie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican candidate , has cast herself as a staunch opponent of tax hikes and has repeatedly railed against the gas tax hike last year even though Christie hailed it as a part of a landmark deal for taxpayers . <p> That might explain why Murphy tried to walk back comments about a possible a new tax for a  dedicated  NJ Transit fund . When pressed by reporters to explain what kind of tax he might be considering , he said he had n't  scoped it out yet .  <p> State Sen. Bob Gordon , D-Fair Lawn , then stepped into the breach and said they state could pool together millions for a dedicated mass transit fund by charging fees for air rights over state properties , raising franchise fees on state-operated building like New Jersey Turnpike rest stops , and imposing assessments on developers in cities , like Jersey City , that depend heavily on mass transit . <p>  You could potentially find the source without having to raise any taxes , ' ' he said , referring to Gordon 's ideas . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Murphy 's main point Thursday was to draw a sharp contrast with Christie , who pushed mass transit to the back seat of his priorities . <p> Christie was the governor who killed an $8.7 billion trans-Hudson River train tunnel to further his presidential ambitions . Murphy was promising to hire a mass transit  emergency manager ,  conduct an audit of the beleaguered NJ Transit , and improve customer relations with more  push notifications  about delays and new apps for their commuter 's phones . <p> And he promised more money for the agency with a dedicated fund . An unspecified tax hike is  potentially ' ' one way of raising the money . That comment helped draw the sharpest contrast to Christie -- and with Democratic candidates for governor over the past 25 years .

What we tried to do is create a restaurant that 's absurd and over the top but could be realistic . I 've had plenty of people ask where it is , but the restaurant is in an empty mansion in Yonkers that we kind of filled . I tend to get carried away so I thought of this restaurant as a brainchild of a very eccentric French guy -- lots of old money , definitely has an appreciation for food and wants to curate a food menu and art on the wall and music in every room .

@@18281937 <h> Fender made the Tesla of guitar amplifiers <h> Written by <h> Share <h> Written by <p> It 's been rumored that rock musician Neil Young has sought out every last unit of a Fender amplifier model , called the Tweed Deluxe , that the company built in 1958 and ' 59 . He 's been using the amps onstage for the majority of his career , and built a convoluted device he calls  The Whizzer  to mechanically move the knobs on the amp from a foot pedal in front of him while he 's onstage . At some point , he will run out of ancient amps to buy , or the vacuum tubes that control them . But the next generation of crotchety rock musicians wo n't have to worry . <p> Today Fender announced the latest version in its best-selling line of guitar amps , the Mustang GT . While the company has released myriad amps that have the ability to simulate the sounds of other amps and effects pedals , and other technological wizardry meant to delight beginners and professionals alike , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 71-year history . They 're the first amps , as Fender 's head of digital technology Ethan Kaplan told Quartz , that are  going to get better over time .  <p> The Mustang GT 200 , with its included foot switch . ( Fender ) <p> Like the promise of the sleek , expensive electric vehicles that Elon Musk has been selling at Tesla , Fender 's new amps would mean that stubborn musicians like Young would n't have to search over and over again for a new analog amp every time it gets beaten up on stage , in order to meet their exacting standards . The new Mustangs are built around an ARM computer processor system , and can use Bluetooth and wifi to connect to the internet , receiving new presets , hardware updates , and features whenever Fender has updates . <p>  If we release a new amp , we can do a simulation of it on this amp ,  Kaplan said . The Mustang models come in three sizes , ranging from a small $250 tabletop practice amp , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . In testing out the Mustang , Kaplan said the team created simulations that the average player would be  hard pressed to tell apart  from the amps they were copying the tone of . And for any new models of amplifiers , or guitar pedals , or any other ideas his team has for the Mustangs , they can just push those over wifi right to the amp .  We never want to run out of things to offer a player ,  he added . <p> The Tone app . ( Fender ) <p> Along with the new amps , Fender introduced a companion app , called Fender Tone . It serves as a hub where users can select pre-designed effects or design their own to use on their amp . Any effect -- such as reverb , delay , chorus , or compression , to name a few -- can be tweaked and modified exactly as they want , and then ported to the amp over Bluetooth . There are other systems that offer similar technology -- IK Multimedia produces a device called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guitar and an amp to mimic the sound of other amps and effects pedals , but most of the features require paying additional fees to unlock software and tethers the player to a complicated set of wires . Fender 's wireless solution is considerably more graceful . <p> Players can also design setlists in the Tone app -- if they 're playing a show and want to use a range of different effects during the show , they can load up presets onto the amp , instead of fiddling with a litany of pedals while they 're playing . <p> Users will be able to upload and share the sounds they 've created in the Tone app on Fender 's Tone community website , as well as download presets that others have made . They can either download them to their Tone app , or if their amp is connected to wifi , send it directly to the amp . Fender has also been taking the Mustang to celebrity musicians -- including Grimes , Gary Clark Jr. , and Josh Adam Klinghoffer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that users can download . <p> The amp doubles as a Bluetooth speaker , so users can also open a streaming app and have their favorite song play through the amp , and strum along . If it 's by one of the celebrities Fender has been working with , or perhaps someone in the Tone community has managed to mimic the sound , the sounds coming out of the Mustang will presumably be pitch-perfect . <p> The amp also continues Fender 's recent push into aesthetics -- both the Mustangs and its recent Acoustic Pro amp look worlds away from the silver or tweed-covered boxes the company has been producing for decades . Kaplan said the Mustang would look as appropriate left out in the living room as it would onstage , especially if it 's being used as a Bluetooth speaker . The design push , the emphasis on digital technology working in concert with traditional hardware , the forming of an online community of Fender fans -- all of these speak toward bringing the guitar business into the 21st century -- much as Musk is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric guitar sales are plummeting , and guitar music is n't topping the charts like it once was . <p>  The industry 's challenge -- or opportunity -- is getting people to commit for life ,  Fender CEO Andy Mooney told Bloomberg in November .  A pretty big milestone for someone adopting any form of instrument is getting them through the first song .  <p> While this amp and app could help keep kids hooked on guitars over the years , it 's just not clear whether there 's going to be another generation picking up guitars ( or fanatically hoarding amps older than them ) like the one currently slipping into retirement .

Too many Americans do not understand what a marvelous governing document we have in the U. S.

For this reason the founders delineated the specific powers each branch of government would operate within . Those not designated were left to the states . We should be happy when the Congress does very little because then it is less intrusive in our daily life . The structure of each House of Congress is meant to slow down activity . The federal government was meant to only do that which individuals can not do for themselves , as in defense of the country . These restrictions leave room for entrepreneurship , innovation , individualism and free market capitalism - the opposite of redistribution of wealth . <p> Education run by Washington bureaucrats has failed us . It should be a local issue . Government closest to the people is most efficient and effective . Local communities are best equipped to decide how they want their children educated . General standards can be set for graduation by the state but how they get there should be left to local school boards .

S. Constitution ) , we have seen the rise of judges legislating new rights , such as privacy in Roe v. Wade . Iowa 's Supreme Court created new law by giving a right to gay marriage while Iowa 's laws supporting traditional marriage were in effect . Iowa was not alone in this fiat . The Supreme Court soon after decided for every state in the union that gay marriage is a right .

But to maximise the return it is important to be in control of what you have , to avoid packaging up fake , discoloured , damaged , or dirty parts . This can become a huge job if you do it by hand , so he built a Lego sorting machine to do the job for him . <p> The machine starts with a hopper for the loose Lego , with a slow belt that tips individual parts down a chute to a faster belt derived from a running trainer . On that they run past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and based on its identification the parts are directed into appropriate bins with carefully timed jets of compressed air . <p> The result is a surprisingly fast way to sort large amounts of bricks without human intervention .

@@18313609 <p> In a lot of ways , Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 feels like familiar territory . We 're back with the same old a-holes we met in the first film , listening to more classic rock tunes while they save the galaxy a second time . <p> But Vol. 2 differs from every other Marvel Cinematic Universe in one major way -- and in doing so , raises the emotional stakes of the franchise as a whole . <p> The third act of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 throws just about every character into the action , putting them all in danger as they battle Ego for the fate of the universe . While most of them ultimately come out clean , however , Yondu dies . Really dies , like **45;1249;TOOLONG ... dies . <p> It 's a devastating turn of events , and in the moment I held out hope it 'd be a fakeout -- that Yondu would turn out to have been only injured , not killed , or that it 'd all be revealed as part of some elaborate ploy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may must be the smartest move that the MCU could 've made at this point in time . <p> Ego truly is the ultimate deadbeat dad . <p> Image : Marvel STudios <h> Why big stakes feel so small <p> The odd paradox of the Marvel movies ( and lots of others like it ) is that its biggest narrative stakes often feel the smallest on an emotional level . The characters might be freaking out about the end of the world , but we 're not , because we know the world ca n't really end and that our main heroes ca n't actually die . Not when there are still five or ten or fifteen more years of sequels to get through . <p> So what really draws us in are the smaller , more personal stakes . Sure , it 's unlikely Bucky will really kill Captain America in The Winter Soldier . Still , we know how much it pains Cap to see his former friend like this , and what it means to him to fight someone he once loved . So we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly certain of the outcome . <p> We love you , Baby Groot , but you 're part of the problem . <p> Image : Marvel STudios <h> Marvel has a fake-death habit <p> One of Marvel 's go-to tools for raising the emotional stakes is character deaths . Bucky , mentioned above , gave Cap something to angst over in the third act of The First Avenger , while Coulson 's demise brought the entire team together in The Avengers . Loki in Thor : The Dark World , Nick Fury in Captain America : The Winter Soldier , Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy : superheroing is a dangerous job , and it 's no wonder so many people perish in the line of work . <p> Except they do n't , really . All of those mentioned above have come back , to diminishing returns . The first time a character miraculously returns from the dead , it 's a shocking plot twist . The fourth or fifth time , it starts to feel like a cheap trick . <p> There are some exceptions . Quicksilver has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultron . Ditto Erskine from Captain America : The First Avenger and Yinsen in the first Iron Man . Plus , bad guys get killed off for good all the time in the MCU . ( Loki being the exception that proves the rule . ) <p> The gang 's all here , for one brief shining moment . <p> Image : Marvel Studios <h> Why Yondu 's death is different <p> But Yondu 's death in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is different . Unlike Quicksilver , Erskine , or Yinsen , Yondu is no mere supporting character , created to help the real heroes get where they 're going before dying tragically to spur them into action . <p> Yondu , in Vol. 2 , is a co-lead . He 's someone we come to care about for his own sake , and not just because of what he means to the other characters . From the moment he appears onscreen , looking lonely and tired in a hedonistic pleasure town , it 's clear we 're going to go much deeper with Yondu in Vol. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about his history and his relationships with Star-Lord and the other Ravagers , the more we love him . <p> Then Yondu dies , sacrificing himself for the surrogate son he 's never quite been able to admit he loves . ( Sob . ) And unlike Groot in Vol. 1 , or any of the other back-from-the-dead characters we mentioned above , he does n't come back . More significantly , there 's no reason to believe he 'll ever come back . His body has essentially been turned into space glitter by the end of the movie . <p> In short , Yondu is the rare major character to die and stay dead in an MCU movie . <p> I 'm not the only one who straight-up sobbed at the Ravager funeral , right ? <p> Image : Marvel Studios <h> How Yondu 's death changes the stakes <p> While there 's never been a specific , on-the-record rule that major characters ca n't be killed in the MCU , the franchise 's track record speaks for itself . Yondu 's death means safety is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we 're entering Game of Thrones-style  anyone can die  territory here . But the reminder that key characters can die comes not a moment too soon . <p> The MCU seems poised for a major shakeup in Avengers : Infinity War and its sequel , and not just in the way that every new movie promises to change the Marvel universe as we know it . <p> 10 years and over a dozen movies in , the MCU finds itself in a point of transition . It 's unclear how many of its original flagship heroes ( i.e. , Iron Man , Captain America , and Thor ) will stick around past the next two Avengers movies . Meanwhile , the MCU has been introducing characters like Doctor Strange and Black Panther who could become the new faces of the franchise . <p> Mind you , we 're not saying that Yondu dying in Vol. 2 definitely means heads will roll in Infinity War , or anything like that . Just that it 's raised the stakes for our heroes -- especially the older ones , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the next MCU movies . <p> We 're gon na miss you , big guy . <p> Image : Marvel Studios <h> Could Yondu return ? <p> That is , assuming Marvel sticks to its guns . The MCU being what it is , it 's not hard to imagine how they could bring back Yondu if they really wanted to . We 've already seen Zola return as a digital version of himself in The Winter Soldier , and Wong saved by the magic of time travel in Doctor Strange . ( Plus , we 'll have Hela , goddess of death , running around as of Thor : Ragnarok -- who knows what she 's capable of ? ) <p> And that 's just in the movies . The Marvel comics are brimming with still other ways to bring back dead characters , including clones and alternate timelines and straight-up magic . <p> But now we 're getting ahead of ourselves .

18325798," Things are n't quite right for religious liberty -- but we 're looking in the right direction . <p> There 's something about politics and maybe the Donald J. Trump administration in a particular way that seems a constant public-service announcement about original sin . Sometimes even when there 's good , it 's not entirely right . I thought of that not for the first time as I watched the president invite the Little Sisters of the Poor up to his Rose Garden podium on the annual National Day of Prayer to be applauded . It was a perplexing and frustrating day as most days when one pays a moment 's notice to politics is . <p> But I 'll give him credit for this : Unlike others , he did not pretend that the Little Sisters religious-liberty  ordeal  unnecessarily prompted by the Obama administration was yet over with the stroke of his pen .

In truth his executive order did n't change anything for them though it and his words at the White House on religious liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous administration , the president and his cabinet saw religious freedom as a narrowing thing , something to be curtailed if the believers were deemed archaic or worse in some of their matters of faith and tradition . <p> The previous administration 's attitude went almost entirely unnoticed by the media for years .

In truth , focusing on them could mean the renewal of our lives and our culture and our politics . They are women who know great love is in sacrifice and making sure that every person knows he is loved . Many you and I may encounter today have no idea they are -- and that void is inhumane and affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communities who insist on making sure people know in the most loving ways make all the difference . <p> On his recent visit to Egypt , Pope Francis said :  The greatness of any nation is revealed in its effective care of society 's most vulnerable members -- women , children , the elderly , the sick , the disabled , and minorities -- lest any person or social group be excluded or marginalized .  And he made clear that religion is never about hatred and violence -- that is a perversion and blasphemy . <p> At a time when the easy thing to do is equate organized religion with violence and evil -- the things which are so repulsive to God and His Word -- because of so much scandal and pain in the world , the likes of the Little Sisters of the Poor stand as a bright counter example , a beacon of love in the midst of horror and anguish . <p> The Little Sisters are the peacemakers , and by celebrating them , we celebrate the kind of love we ourselves want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis also said in the same address to government officials and diplomats in Cairothat  History . . . honors men and women of peace , who courageously and non-violently strive to build a better world :  Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called children of God  ( Mt5:9 ) .  <p> The Little Sisters are the peacemakers , and by celebrating them , we celebrate the kind of love we ourselves want , and for those we most love . Can we desire that for our enemies , too ? For those we never give thought to ? That 's what makes the difference in revolutionizing the way we life and act and show ourselves to the world . The Little Sisters do n't ask you to do what they do or believe what they believe , but when you see the radiant light radiating from their hearts and deeds , you want what they have .

18347212," A great deal has been said about Donald Trump 's violations of  democratic norms .  I agree with much of it . <p> But the big problem with violating democratic norms -- the unwritten customs and practices even political opponents traditionally abide by -- is that once you 've done it , everybody wants to do it too . When the people most offended by Trump 's violations indulge in similar behavior , they not only contribute to the problem , they create incentives for Trump and his biggest supporters to keep doing it . <p> For example , the outgoing Obama administration was horrified by the prospect of being replaced by the Trump administration . The exact details have yet to be determined , but it seems that some in the old guard may have violated norms about  unmasking  the identities of certain individuals , and they certainly violated them by leaking various highly classified details to the press . In response Trump claimed vindication in his claims he was  wiretapped .  <p> A better example might be Stephen Colbert , host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found a sweet spot in the ratings as a leading voice of the anti-Trump  resistance .  That 's fine . TV is a niche business these days , even at the broadcast networks . But last week , Colbert 's animus toward Trump 's crudeness got the better of him . Suffice it to say that if you want to condemn a president for his incivility , you squander some credibility when you describe the president of the United State in a lewd act with a foreign dictator . <p> The big problem with violating democratic norms is that once you 've done it , everybody wants to do it too . <p> The most acute example of the problem , however , is working its way through the courts . During the campaign , Trump outrageously and ridiculously called for a  total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States . He justified the ban on the campaign trail with lots of incendiary statements . <p> One of his first acts as president was to sign an executive order suspending entry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It empowered government agencies to allow for exceptions on a case-by-case basis . <p> The order , which was immediately blocked by federal courts and ultimately rescinded , was a sloppy piece of work . But it was n't a Muslim ban . The vast majority of Muslims live outside of those seven countries and were unaffected by it . <p> In March a second  travel ban  executive order was issued to take into account some of the legal and political objections to the first . Iraq was dropped from the list entirely , for example . <p> That order too was blocked by judges . The 4th Circuit in Virginia heard arguments in the case Monday . <p> Reasonable people can disagree with the policy merits of the ban , legally , morally , politically and strategically . But what I find troubling is the way various judges have taken to acting like pundits weighing in on Trump 's campaign rhetoric . For instance , Hawaii Judge Derrick Watson , of the 9th Circuit , responded to the idea that Trump 's past utterances are irrelevant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a corner , pull the shutters closed , and pretend it has not seen what it has .  <p> Historically , paying such deference to political rhetoric is highly irregular . The motivations of politicians , real or perceived , are not normally given any weight and virtually never disqualify legal language  between the four corners of the page  -- the text of the executive order itself , in this case . <p> If you 're a close student of history , you might have noticed that even before Trump , candidates often promised grandiose , irresponsible or silly things on the campaign trail . Once elected , they discover they ca n't deliver . <p> And that 's a good thing . This is how democratic norms , formal and informal , are supposed to work . <p> Barack Obama was once a vocal fan of single-payer healthcare . Imagine the outrage if judges ignored the text of Obamacare and invalidated it on the grounds that his campaign rhetoric proved his real intent . <p> I do n't blame judges or anyone else for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedians or pundits . Their job is to follow the law . <p> Trump does n't help by referring to his executive orders as a  ban  ( so as to pretend he 's fulfilled a promise he could never keep ) .

It opens up the opportunity for more broadcasters from different backgrounds and gives the consumer more choice .  <p> The authenticity of content and how new technologies might be able to combat the proliferation of fake news will be another talking point at the conference . <p>  Right now , what we have to do is go frame by frame just to make sure that something was n't put together with Photoshop or a tool like that ,  Abuagla says .

@@18348087 <h> U.S. poised for major expansion of military effort against Taliban in Afghanistan <p> U.S. forces and Afghan commandos patrol April 17 , 2017 , in Asad Khil village near the site of a U.S. bombing in the Achin district of Jalalabad , east of Kabul , Afghanistan . <p> President Donald Trump 's most senior military and foreign policy advisers have proposed a major shift in strategy in Afghanistan that would effectively put the United States back on a war footing with the Taliban . <p> The new plan , which still must be approved by the president , calls for expanding the U.S. military role as part of a broader effort to push an increasingly confident and resurgent Taliban back to the negotiating table , U.S. officials said . <p> The plan comes at the end of a sweeping policy review built around the president 's desire to reverse worsening security in Afghanistan and  start winning  again , said one U.S. official , who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations . <p> The new strategy , which has the backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the White House , to set troop numbers in Afghanistan and give the military far broader authority to use airstrikes to target Taliban militants . It would also lift Obama-era restrictions that limited the mobility of U.S. military advisers on the battlefield . <p> The net result of the changes would be to reverse moves by President Barack Obama to steadily limit the U.S. military role in Afghanistan , along with the risk to American troops and the cost of the war effort , more than 15 years after U.S. forces first arrived there . <p> Trump is expected to make a final call on the strategy before a May 25 NATO summit in Brussels that he plans to attend . <p> Officials said it is unclear whether Trump , who has spoken little about the United States ' longest war , will look favorably upon expanding the U.S. role in Afghanistan . While he has voiced skepticism about allowing U.S. troops to become bogged down in foreign conflicts , the president has also expressed a desire to be tough on terrorism and has seemed to delight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to send a message that , yes , the U.S. is going to send more troops , but it 's not to achieve a forever military victory ,  said Andrew Wilder , an Afghanistan expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace .  Rather , it 's to try to bring about a negotiated end to this conflict .  <p> The new strategy is a product of the U.S. military 's mounting worries that the fragile stalemate with the Taliban has been steadily eroding for years , jeopardizing the survival of an allied government and endangering a key U.S. base for combating militant groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State throughout South Asia . <p> Even as it moves to the president 's desk , the proposal faces resistance from some senior administration officials who fear a repeat of earlier decisions to intensify military efforts that produced only temporary improvements . <p> Inside the White House , those opposed to the plan have begun to refer derisively to the strategy as  McMaster 's War ,  a reference to H.R. McMaster , the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan and was one of the architects of President George W. Bush 's troop surge in Iraq , is the driving force behind the new strategy at the White House . <p> The White House declined to comment . <p> The plan envisions an increase of at least 3,000 U.S. troops to an existing force of about 8,400 . The U.S. force would also be bolstered by requests for matching troops from NATO nations . <p> But , in keeping with the Trump administration 's desire to empower military decision-making , the Pentagon would have final say on troop levels and how those forces are employed on the battlefield . The plan would also increase spending on Afghanistan 's troubled government in an effort to improve its capacity . <p> The additional troops and aid spending would add to the fiscal toll of a war that already costs $23 billion annually , a factor Trump advisers expect will weigh heavily in the president 's consideration of additional military actions . <p> In a break with the past , U.S. officials said that increases in U.S. troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heavily conditioned on the ability of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani , who heads a fragile unity government , to weed out ineffective military commanders and reduce corruption , both of which have led some aggrieved Afghans to turn to the Taliban as a better alternative . <p> The question at the heart of the new strategy is whether U.S. and Afghan forces , even if bolstered by new troops and authorities to target the Taliban , can create enough pressure to push the war toward a negotiated settlement . Those opposing the escalation have argued that even the Obama-era surge , which peaked at 100,000 , did not result in Taliban concessions in on-again , off-again U.S.-Taliban talks begun in 2011 . <p> That effort eventually crumbled amid U.S. government divisions and resistance from the Afghan government , which feared being cut out of the process . While Pakistan and other governments have sought to foster separate talks in recent years , progress has been scant since the 2016 death of Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in a U.S. airstrike . <p> Those failures , and his deep-seated desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to craft a plan to cut U.S. troop levels to 1,000 before leaving office . In late 2014 , he also took away the military 's authority to directly target Taliban leadership , stating that the United States was no longer at war with the insurgent group . <p> But the Taliban 's advance across Afghanistan , where it has chipped away at government control of rural areas and occasionally seized a major city , eventually compelled Obama to abandon that low troop target . <p> Obama also loosened rules so U.S. forces could target the Taliban with airstrikes in limited situations , for example when Afghan troops faced danger of being overrun or needed support from American warplanes for major operations . <p> Under the steps proposed in the new strategy , U.S. aircraft would again be permitted to strike the Taliban in a broader array of situations , allowing for greater air support of Afghan offensives . The new rules would also enable U.S. military advisers to accompany conventional Afghan forces closer to the front lines , similar to the freedom they enjoy with elite Afghan forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by the outgoing U.S. military commander for Afghanistan provoked a backlash among top Pentagon leaders , but this time military leaders including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are supportive . <p> The new strategy comes at a critical time for Afghan forces , which have taken massive casualties and continue to suffer from corruption and poor leadership . Their vulnerability was exposed last month when a handful of Taliban militants killed 140 soldiers in an assault on a military base in northern Afghanistan . <p> Even proponents of the plan have modest expectations for what an enhanced military effort , given the Taliban 's strength , can achieve . Rather than stopping them from taking over additional territory , officials expect that Afghan forces will at best be able to  hold the line  this year and begin to recapture some key terrain from the Taliban next year . <p> The goal is to make  incremental progress  in coming years in the hope that those gains will be enough to persuade the Taliban to make concessions that will lead to peace , said a U.S. official familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Obama 's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , said that to achieve a sustainable resolution , security investments must be matched by actions to support political and economic stability .  All of this leads back to prioritizing the launch of a viable peace process in Afghanistan and using any military decision to support that process ,  he said . <p> Wilder said the emphasis on using military pressure to reach a political agreement made sense but that there is no guarantee it would work given the diverse objectives of key players in the war , such as the Taliban , the Afghan government , Pakistan , Iran and increasingly Russia . <p> Even backers of a more robust approach concede that the chances of a major peace deal to end the war are low . <p>  If we do n't achieve that , Plan B should be to prevent state collapse , which would also require additional military resources ,  Wilder said .

18350713," An Iron Range man has been charged with spending days in the woods with two other men cutting down and stealing roughly 1,200 birch trees from state land in northern Minnesota . <p> The prosecution of David A. Lawrence , 40 , of Aurora , comes as thieves over the past few months have been illegally culling forests in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin of the paper-white trees , which have become popular in home decor . <p> Law enforcement in both states said the targeted trees are generally young -- 10 to 15 years old -- and range in size from 2 to 4 inches in diameter and 10 to 18 feet tall . <p> Lawrence was charged last week by summons in St. Louis County District Court with timber trespass on state lands , a gross misdemeanor . He was not immediately available to respond to the allegations , and court records show no attorney for him . <p> The birch trees were valued at about $3,400 , which includes the felled trees and the cost to repair the damage to the woodlands , according to the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell each tree , referred to as a pole , for about $1 . <p> Lt.

In another case , a citation was issued in St. Louis County for harvesting birch without a permit . <p> According to the criminal complaint : <p> A state conservation officer on patrol March 17 southwest of Embarrass spotted a path leading into the woods off Tower Biwabik Road and went into the forest .

He said  he sells the poles to a man from Wisconsin and last sold to him on Wednesday ,  March 16 , the complaint read . <p> As for the two men with Lawrence , Patten said they were not charged because they are American Indian and were cutting in an area covered by a treaty from the 1850s . <p> Harvesting birch is legal in some areas , with proper permitting from the state or permission from a private landowner . <p> Permitting allows the state to manage the resource ; otherwise , the long-term supply of birch in the state is threatened , according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources . <p> Many state-funded Texas adoption and foster care agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious grounds -- and legislation that got initial approval in the state House on Tuesday is designed to protect them from potential lawsuits from doing so . <p> Democrat Heath Mello lost his race for Omaha mayor Tuesday in a setback for supporters who argued that the Democratic National Committee and abortion rights groups were wrong to attack the anti-abortion former state senator .

18351472," Budget talks between Gov . Mark Dayton and Republican legislative leaders swerved off track on Tuesday , as the GOP-led House and Senate began to vote on and pass a series of major spending bills that the DFL governor promised he would veto . <p> The breakdown in negotiations comes with less than two weeks to the end of the legislative session . It elevated the likelihood that the session 's closing weeks will be overrun with partisan recriminations between Dayton and Republican majorities , and the possibility of a lengthy budget stalemate . Such standoffs caused state government shutdowns in 2005 ( under Gov . Tim Pawlenty ) and 2011 ( under Dayton ) . <p> After a week of closed-door negotiations , Tuesday was a day of fits and starts at the Capitol . Dayton and GOP leaders met privately in the afternoon , but both sides also appeared before reporters to publicly blame the other for the stalled talks . The bottom line : Dayton and Republicans remain deeply divided over how to spend about $46 billion in taxpayer dollars in the next two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those bills , which will leave us with the same differences several days from now that we face today ,  Dayton said in a statement Tuesday evening , around the time the Legislature started to move on the GOP-crafted bills .  Their actions will make it much more difficult for them to fulfill their Constitutional responsibility to send me budget bills , which I can sign , by May 22nd .  <p> The Republican plan , assembled by leaders in the House and Senate , calls for using much of the state 's $1.65 billion surplus to provide more than $1 billion in new tax cuts and credits that principally benefit farmers , college students , businesses , senior citizens and people paying for child care . It cuts or slows the growth of state spending for environmental protection , health and human services benefits and other areas . <p> Major budget divisions <p> Taxes : Republicans want to use most of the state 's $1.65 billion surplus on more than $1 billion in new tax cuts and credits . Dayton 's plan calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Services : GOP leaders want to cut about $500 million from a variety of state programs , while Dayton wants to add about $300 million in new spending -- a move he says is necessary to keep up with a growing and aging population . <p> Education : Both parties are divided on how much to spend , particularly on Dayton 's proposal to add $175 million to expand prekindergarten programs . Republicans want to cut that program and instead spend a smaller amount on need-based scholarships that could be used for private preschools . <p> Transportation : Though both Dayton and Republican leaders say they are nearing agreement on transportation spending , they remain divided over their priorities . GOP lawmakers have targeted transit funding and projects , while DFLers are looking to balance transit with money for roads and bridges . <p> The GOP plan also eliminates a new prekindergarten program that Dayton counts among his signature achievements , instead prioritizing spending on scholarships for private or public preschools . The budget bills contain a long list of changes to state policy , ranging from eliminating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of new light-rail lines without the Legislature 's approval . <p> Since last week , House Speaker Kurt Daudt , R-Crown , and Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka , R-Nisswa , have led a group of Republican lawmakers meeting regularly with Dayton and his aides as the sides attempted to bridge differences . Those talks appeared to implode by late Monday , as legislative budget committees finalized their bills and prepared for votes . On Tuesday morning , Daudt and Gazelka said they were frustrated by a slow pace they blamed on Dayton . <p> Daudt said Republicans were prepared to move forward without Dayton if the governor did n't come closer to the GOP plans . <p>  There 's just a lot of really good things in these bills , so our hope is that this is something the governor can adopt because we know Minnesotans would be behind it ,  he said . <p> The speaker followed through on that pledge later in the day . Less than a half-hour after wrapping up negotiations with Dayton -- and without notice -- the Legislature began approving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment spending . <p> On the floor of the House and Senate , and around the Capitol , DFL lawmakers reacted with concern and outrage . Sen.

She , Daudt and Gazelka said Republicans do n't want to be blamed for not approving a full state budget by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the much messier , politically damaging proposition of a state government shutdown , lawmakers must pass a budget -- and get it signed by the governor -- by July 1 . <p> Many state-funded Texas adoption and foster care agencies routinely deny non-Christian , gay , and unmarried applicants on religious grounds -- and legislation that got initial approval in the state House on Tuesday is designed to protect them from potential lawsuits from doing so . <p> Democrat Heath Mello lost his race for Omaha mayor Tuesday in a setback for supporters who argued that the Democratic National Committee and abortion rights groups were wrong to attack the anti-abortion former state senator . <p> The FBI director 's firing sparked immediate fears that the bureau 's probe into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign might be upended now that Trump himself can handpick its new supervisor .

18352983," Top Story <p> WASHINGTON - FBI Director James Comey has been dismissed by the president , according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer .  The president has accepted the recommendation of the Attorney General and the deputy Attorney General regarding the dismissal of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ,  Spicer told reporters in the briefing room.Spicer also said that Comey was  notified a short time ago .  This is effective  immediately ,  he said.Earlier in the day , the FBI notified Congress that Comey misstated key findings involving the Hillary Clinton email investigation during testimony last week , saying that only a  small number ' ' of emails had been forwarded to disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner , not the  hundreds and thousands ' ' he 'd claimed in his testimony.The letter was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday , more than a week after Comey testified for hours in defense of his handling of the Clinton probe .  This letter is intended to supplement that testimony to ensure that the committee has the full context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' wrote FBI Assistant Director Gregory Brower.In defending the probe at last week 's hearing , Comey offered seemingly new details to underscore the seriousness of the situation FBI agents faced last fall when they discovered thousands of Clinton aide Huma Abedin 's emails on the computer of her husband , Anthony Weiner .  Somehow , her emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner , including classified information ,  Comey said , adding later ,  His then-spouse Huma Abedin appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him for him I think to print out for her so she could then deliver them to the secretary of state .  At another point in the testimony , Comey said Abedin  forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails , some of which contain classified information . ' ' Neither of those statements is accurate , said people close to the investigation.Tuesday 's letter said  most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner 's laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abedin to Mr. Weiner . ' ' The letter also corrected the impression Mr. Comey 's testimony had left with some listeners that 12 classified emails were among those forwarded by Abedin to Weiner .  Investigators identified approximately 49,000 emails which were potentially relevant to the investigation ,  the letter said .  All were reviewed with a particular focus on those containing classified information . Investigators ultimately determined that two e-mail chains containing classified information were manually forwarded to Mr. Weiner 's account . ' ' Ten other emails chains that contained classified information were found on the laptop as a result of backup activity.The letter also clarified some of the figures Comey gave regarding ongoing terrorism probes.The issue of Comey 's misstatements was first reported by ProPublica.At the hearing , the statements about Abedin 's email practices were immediately seized on by Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and others , who demanded to know why Abedin was n't charged with a crime . Comey said it was difficult finding evidence those involved in Clinton 's use of private email knowingly engaged in wrongdoing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without some indicator of intent.Comey 's incorrect comments about Abedin surfaced again this week at a different Senate hearing , when Cruz pressed former director of national intelligence James Clapper Jr . to say how he would handle an employee who  forwarded hundreds or even thousands of emails to a non-government individual , their spouse , on a non-government computer . ' ' Clapper said such conduct  raises all kinds of potential security concerns . ' ' At the hearing last week , Comey spent hours defending his handling of the investigation of Clinton 's use of a private server for work while she was secretary of state , saying it made him  mildly nauseous  to think his decisions might have affected the outcome of the presidential election , but insisting that he had no regrets and would not have handled it differently.Comey 's decision-making during the Clinton inquiry has come under sustained criticism from Democrats - including Clinton - who say it was a major factor that contributed to her presidential election defeat in November to Donald Trump . On Oct. 28 , less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that new Clinton-related emails had been found on a laptop belonging to Weiner.Days later , investigators obtained a search warrant to examine about 3,000 messages on the device that were work-related .

State Sen. Ellis Black called its passing a  no-win situation  for legislators because both sides did n't get everything they wanted , and supporters remain unhappy with all the exceptions . <p> Guns will remain banned from the following parts of campus : student housing ; fraternity and sorority houses ; any preschool or childcare space ; any  room or space  where high school students take classes through dual enrollment ; buildings or property used for athletic events ; faculty , staff and administrative offices ; and places where disciplinary proceedings are held . <p> The caveats included in the two-page bill signed by Gov .

That responsibility is now in the hands of the University System of Georgia , the network of 28 public colleges and universities that includes VSU , University of Georgia and Georgia Institute of Technology . <p> However , a few points clearly demonstrate that the switch to guns on campus will not be the free-wheeling , expansive change that opponents fear it will be or that supporters want it to be . <p> For starters , the law only applies to public colleges and universities in Georgia , so places like Emory University and Mercer University are not included . <p> Also , only people with weapons carry licenses will be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus and a person has to be 21 or older to apply for the license .

Who would keep up with that slippery list and make sure it is properly enforced ? <p> Similar quandaries arise when looking at faculty and staff offices : They are sprinkled all throughout campus in several buildings .

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska . She told reporters Tuesday ,  I just wan na make sure we have some women on  the Senate health care group . <p> And Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would n't join now even if she was asked . <p>  I really do n't want to . You know , there are so many important issues in health care that to spend all my time talking about this seems like not a productive way to move forward ,  Collins said . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one of several discussions ongoing and that every Senate Republican will have a say . <p>  Nobody 's being excluded based on gender ,  McConnell said , pointing to an hour-long lunch of Senate Republicans on Tuesday where health care was the main topic of discussion .  What you should write - we 're having a discussion about the real issues . Everybody 's at the table . Everybody .  <p> But the  working group ,  McConnell helped to convene consists of a group of 13 members , including himself , met for the second time on Tuesday before the entire Republican conference met for lunch . At this meeting , the members discussed the topic of Medicaid . <p> After criticism of the group mounted , Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was invited to join Tuesday 's meeting to discuss the health insurance program for low-income Americans , an issue that particularly influences her state . <p>  Those are choices that were made ,  Capito said about the makeup of the group .  You know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be participating very loudly .  <p>  Leaders have the right to choose whomever they wish . It does n't mean I 'm not going to work on health care ,  said Sen.

I think I can bring some experience to the debate that will be helpful .  <p> Democrats have been quick to point out the lack of women in the group .  I would hope that Senator McConnell would be a little more sensitive to the fact he 's picked a dozen men on his side , there are certainly some very competent women he could 've chosen ,  Sen.

Rob Portman of Ohio , a state that expanded Medicaid , is concerned with an abrupt end to the expansion that he says has helped Ohio residents . He floated adding increasing the tax credits for low-income people if the Medicaid expansion is cut . <p>  I 'd like to change the House version of the tax credit by the way and focus it more on people who are close to the poverty line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portman told reporters . <p> On the other end of the ideological spectrum , Sen. Lee wants to end the Medicaid expansion and reduce the number of people receiving it by restricting it to expectant mothers , the disabled and caregivers of young children . <p> In addition , Lee wants a repeal of all insurance mandates , including essential health benefits and even pre-existing conditions , which is politically explosive . The House bill has been criticized for amendments that would allow people with pre-existing conditions to be charged more . <p> But Sen. Lamar Alexander , chairman of the Senate Health , Education and Labor Committee , who is on the working group , said that one of his four priorities is to  make sure people with pre-existing conditions have access to health care .  <p> Senators say they are aware of the policy challenges and are cautioning against any legislation being introduced soon . <p>  We 're going to have to satisfy 51 senators . And I ca n't tell you how long that 's going to take . ... We do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second highest ranking Republican in the Senate .  But it 's going to take some time to get to that consensus .  <p> Meanwhile , all 48 Democrats , including the two independents who caucus with the Democrats , wrote a letter to McConnell asking him not to gut Obamacare and instead work with them to make health care better . <p>  Democrats stand ready -- as we always have -- to develop legislation with Republicans that will improve quality , lower costs , and expand coverage for all Americans . But Republicans need to set aside their current partisan efforts and work with us to get this done ,  the Democrats wrote in the letter . <p> Vice President Mike Pence attended a Senate luncheon Tuesday to discuss health care , among other issues .

The Human Coalition is a pro-life group which hopes  abortion will become unthinkable and unavailable in our lifetime .  Obviously , that 's not the sort of thing you see published in the NY Times very often : <p>  Abortion rights are a key pillar of income equality ,  writes Ellen Shaffer at the Center for Policy Analysis .  Opposition to abortion rights is a key factor keeping women and kids in poverty .  Another commentator asserts that lack of abortion access is  one of the biggest contributors to the gender wage gap .  <p> Activists see a lot of appeal in this argument , a way to bridge the gap between liberal women and economic populists . But it comes with enormous baggage . <p> Above all , it 's a profoundly dehumanizing argument . It reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts to saying we are justified in killing those who impede our economic progress . Parenting presents undeniable challenges , but no one argues that those challenges give parents the right to kill their children . <p> This last statement is undeniably true . No one ( well , almost no one ) argues women should have the right to kill newborns based on economic circumstances . Infanticide is simply not an acceptable or appropriate solution to income inequality . <p> Despite this rejection of the argument which views abortion in economic terms , the author of the piece quotes Frederica Mathewes-Green saying  an animal , caught in a trap , wants to gnaw off its own leg .  In other words , women who feel trapped ( economically ) are likely to see abortion as a way out . But the author argues there 's a better solution : <p> There are better solutions ; they just require more creativity and more effort . Organizations like mine can help women find jobs , enter substance abuse treatment programs , regain their children from foster care , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <p> I see a bit of self-contradiction here . On the one hand , the author is saying that there 's something dehumanizing about viewing abortion in economic terms . On the other hand , she 's suggesting jobs , housing , help with bills , and government benefits are a way to resolve the problem of an unplanned pregnancy . Those are obviously all economic solutions . In other words , the author seems to be reinforcing the idea that economics and abortion really are linked , though she does n't see her own use of that argument as dehumanizing . <p> Here 's what I think the author meant : Yes , there is a link between economics and abortion but we 're addressing the problem in the least humane way . Rather than seeing abortion as a quick solution for a woman who feels trapped , we should instead be looking for practical ways to un-trap her . To their credit , that does seem to be part of what the Human Coalition is trying to do .

Where some see the image and point to the anonymity of the client and apparently undignified exposure of an underage girl , I see the astounding resilience of a young woman who takes ownership of her reality -- unlawful , deplorable and bleak though it is -- and determines to be more than what her circumstances have forced upon her . I see a woman who wants to speak directly to viewers , saying if you actually want to understand my perspective  then look into my eyes and see what I feel .  <p> Human rights activist Godden does n't agree with Datta 's choice of showing the girl 's face in the photo .

During one of these encounters , Ivanov told Aida that his  body is only designed for killing  -- which uses the same phrasing as Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing and suggests that Ivanov could be a loose adaptation of the character of the same name . <p> Earlier in the season , Aida dismembered Ivanov and turned him into a Life Model Decoy like herself .

In the comics , M.O.D.O.K. was an employee of Advanced Ideas Mechanics ( AIM ) who underwent an experiment that mutated him ; he eventually went on to take over AIM as the Scientist Supreme . Likewise , Ivanov was the leader of his own shadowy organization before an experiment-gone-wrong transformed him into part man , part machine . <p> The similarities do n't stop there . M.O.D.O.K. cloned himself and a version of himself went on to become M.O.D.O.K. Superior , who claimed to have bred himself out of trauma and weakness . As such , M.O.D.O.K. shares a name with Ivanov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Season 4 . Likewise , Ivanov made multiple LMD copies of himself in  The Return ,  in a move similar to M.O.D.O.K.

After all , M.O.D.O.K. and Ivanov also have similar power sets . Thanks to his mutations , M.O.D.O.K. has a computer-like memory and can retain large amounts of information , as well as solve complex mathematical problems with superhuman speed .

The American Bar Association selected that theme to recognize the upcoming 150th anniversary of this post-civil war amendment . We 'll revisit the highlights of how 14th Amendment has changed America . I 'll note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil liberties . <p> But then I 'll address contemporary threats to our freedom and the rule of law , threats arising in unlikely places -- our nation 's colleges and universities . <p> First , the historical highlights , which are familiar to us . The United States Constitution is the oldest in use in the world today . We won our freedom from a tyrannical Monarchy . Our revolutionary leaders understood that concentrations of power in one leader or institution leads to despotism and abuse . So the framers wove into our constitution a brilliant set of checks and balances including an independent judiciary and a bill of rights ratified to limit the power of the Federal government . But the bill of rights did not protect against abuse of state or local government power , and the original constitution , ratified in our nation 's fragile infancy , left intact the institution of slavery . <p> It took the cathartic Civil War to set the stage for the next big constitutional step forward : the emancipation of slaves and the post-war amendments . The civil war killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six million Americans today . Iowa contributed more soldiers per capita to the Union army than any other State , and 13,000 Iowa volunteers lost their lives during that conflict . Illinois suffered comparable burdens and provided our nation with our greatest president , Abraham Lincoln . <p> The post-war amendments , ratified during Reconstruction in 1868-70 , had both immediate effect and great promise unfulfilled for another century . The 13th amendment prohibited slavery ; the 15th amendment extended voting rights to the freed slaves ; although voting rights of women were not confirmed until the 19th amendment was ratified in 1920 . <p> The 14th Amendment did three important things . First , it said that states could not deprive persons of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . Second , it said that states could not deny anyone equal protection of the laws . And third , it expressly extended citizenship to all persons born in the United States , including the newly freed slaves . In doing so , it overruled Dred Scott , our national supreme court 's worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached free soil . <p> Iowa had led the way . In 1839 , 17 years before Dred Scott got it wrong , the Supreme Court of the Territory of Iowa got it right , in its first decision , In re Ralph , granting freedom to a slave brought to Iowa . <p> Despite the 14th Amendment 's guarantee of equal protection , state-sanctioned racial discrimination and segregation persisted , especially in the South where some still called the civil war  the war of northern aggression .  <p> The 14th amendment 's great promise of equal protection fell victim to judicial interpretation in 1896 , when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that  separate but equal  facilities satisfied the 14th Amendment . The Supreme Court did n't overrule Plessy until 1954 when Brown v. Bd. of Educ. declared unconstitutional government-sanctioned segregation . <p> Yet Iowa had led the way in desegregation . In 1868 , Alexander Clark , an African American in Muscatine sued and won an order from the Iowa District court compelling the Muscatine School district to admit his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rejecting the argument that separate schools segregated by race satisfied the equality our law demands . And in 1873 , the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of a mixed race passenger , Emma Coger , who successfully challenged a river steamship company 's white-only rule for first class dining . This was 8 decades before Brown v. Bd. of Educ . <p> Meanwhile , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905 began actively using the 14th amendment 's due process guarantee to strike down state laws regulating businesses for public health and welfare , beginning with Lochner in 1905 . Thus , for a while , the Supreme Court would not allow states to adopt wage and hour laws . Only after the Great Depression and President Franklin Roosevelt 's court-packing threat did the Court adopt its now familiar deference to economic regulations . <p> The next big step forward for the 14th amendment was the incorporation doctrine in the 1960 's under Chief Justice Earl Warren . The Warren Court relied on the 14th amendment 's due process clause to extend most of the protections of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark decisions Gideon v. Wainright on the right to counsel in state prosecutions -- at government expense for the indigent , and Miranda v. Arizona , requiring the now familiar warnings before interrogations in police custody . <p> Next the U.S. Supreme Court relied on the 14th amendment due process clause to recognize constitutional rights to privacy , including abortion in Roe v. Wade . More recently , courts relied on the 14th amendment equal protection clause to extend the right to marry to same sex couples nationwide culminating in the 5 to 4 decision by the SCOTUS in 2015 striking down laws remaining in over 30 states that still restricted marriage to couples of the opposite sex . <p> There again , Iowa had led the way . In 2009 , the Iowa became the third State in the nation , the first in the Midwest , and the first by a unanimous state supreme court decision , to recognize a constitutional equal protection right for same-sex couples to marry . <p> That 's the big picture . The 14th amendment has profoundly shaped our Democracy , from ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our basic civil liberties in the bill of rights to protect against any government action , including state and local . <p> But the work is never done .

@@18361655 <p> Away from the carefully stage-managed campaign events and stump speeches where Theresa May can be seen answering preselected questions in front of Conservative party activists ahead of the general election on 8 June , she can bank on the unfailing support from an entirely different group of people . <p> The prime minister is the focus of a small but fast-growing online fandom , expressed through social media posts and memes created primarily by young women based in the UK and around the world who are inspired by her fashion choices and unflashy political style . <p> BuzzFeed News has spoken to a handful of young May supporters -- some of whom proudly call themselves  Mayllennials  . While they are united in their admiration for May , many are nonpartisan and stop short of supporting the Conservative party 's centre-right policies . <p> Typically , internet fandoms are centred around singers , film stars or someone with a bit more currency in mainstream youth culture . But like the fandom associated with former Labour leader Ed Miliband -- the Milifandom -- that emerged in the run-up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But there 's one big way this differs from the Milifandom : Many of the May supporters BuzzFeed News tracked down would only speak on the condition of anonymity and asked that this article posted no links to their blogs , for fear that anti-Tory activists would personally target them and send abuse . <p> One of several Theresa May appreciation accounts on Instagram , itsgonnabetmay posts daily pictures , memes , and news coverage from the campaign trail as well as archive pictures from May 's long career as a Conservative activist and politician . <p> Its creator , a 20-year-old British woman now living in America , told BuzzFeed News she started the account because of the lack of Instagram accounts being positive about May that  are n't being run by the far-right  . <p> She said she admired May 's  ability to get the job done while still being able to loosen up sometimes  . But she made it clear that despite being a fan of the prime minister , that admiration does n't extend to the Tories generally . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason I tolerate the Tories ,  the woman said ,  although I hold views considered to be progressive by most of the Conservative party in the UK .  <p> A Theresa May-themed dress , as featured on May fandom social media accounts <p> She was clear about one thing , though : The Mayllennials are definitely a thing . <p>  The term shows just how vibrant TM 's support base is ,  she said .  You 've got young people supporting her . In fact you may consider her the UK 's Justin Trudeau . Yes . I 'm a Mayllennial .  <p> One young British female Theresa May fan , who asked not to be named , said she started her May-related Tumblr blog recently , after looking for  positive , fun  content about May online but not finding any . <p> She said she was a Conservative supporter but that she was more interested in May herself . The fandom is essentially like any other you could find on Tumblr , she said : <p>  People just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people they admire and support with other like-minded tumblr users . <p>  I think so many young people are appreciative of TM because we not only believe that she 's the best person for the job , but that she 's redefining the role of leadership by doing away with a lot of the fuss .  <p> She added that for many fans , the May 's fashion choices were key . Instagram accounts such as theresamaystyle , which simply details what she wears , are among the most popular May-related accounts online . <p>  She 's also redefining the image of professional women . In the past there has been this perception that if you cared about fashion then you were n't serious about your job . TM clearly states that you can do both and neither is a reflection on the other .  <p> On why she and other May supporters were so shy in being public , she said :  You 'll notice TM 's official social media pages get very little engagement from her supporters , and I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arguments starting as a result .  <p> But do n't compare this to the Milifandom though .  My limited understanding of the Milifandom is that they were teenage girls with a crush on him ? Well we 're all older and admire TM as a person and role model so I 'd have to say no , we 're not at all like that ,  the blogger said . <p> Rachel , 27 , a grad student from Missouri , is one of several foreign May fans . She first became aware of her when May won the Tory leadership contest last July . A teenage fan of Margaret Thatcher and also a Trump voter , Rachel was impressed by May . <p>  I loathe the leftist thinking that women , in order to be successful , should adopt all the worst characteristics of men ,  she said . <p>  I 'm always thrilled to see right-wing women holding prominent offices -- I think it 's important for young girls to see women in government , but I also think it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive claim on the advancement of women . I loved her comment in her first Prime Minister 's Questions that what the Conservative Party does for women is to keep making us prime minister . <p>  And I especially love that she feels no need to make herself appear less feminine , with skirts and leopard heels and gorgeous evening gowns like that one that went to the Lord Mayor 's Banquet , while the Americans are left wondering if Hillary Clinton would spontaneously combust if she touched something that was n't a pantsuit .  <p> A popular Mayllennial Tumblr is The Last Woman Standing , a parody account that speaks in May 's voice . The woman who runs it , who is based in Southeast Asia and requested not to be named , said that for many young fans May is seen as inspirational -- even though they are not completely in step with her politics . <p>  These young women who like her , not all of them agree with her policies , including myself . In that case , she is seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women to be better leaders than her ,  the woman said . <p>  I started the parody blog because I like Theresa May so much . Of course , that does n't mean I endorse ALL her policies . There are policies of hers that I disagree with . <p>  In general , I do not agree with much of what the Conservative Party stands for . In fact , if I could vote in the UK , I would be likely to vote for Labour since they are the closest to my political beliefs . It 's probably Theresa being the Conservative Party leader that makes the Conservatives seem tolerable .  <p> Asked whether she considers herself a Mayllennial , she replied :  I believe that 's what Theresa May 's fandom is called , if so , then yes , I would call myself a Mayllennial .  <p> Another Tumblr blogger , who is 22 and from Belgium , when asked to comment on her involvement in the Theresa May fandom , was cautious and asked for anonymity .  These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's target audience and I do n't want to attract social media trolls ,  she said . <p> She started her blog some months ago , before the snap election was called , because she was uncomfortable posting May-related content on her personal blog in her own name . <p>  I feared some of my friends , especially those living in the UK , might turn against me . If there were people on tumblr who liked Theresa , I 'm sure they would find me through my new blog , and I would find them . And that 's exactly what happened .  <p> Asked whether she would consider herself a Conservative supporter , she said :  No , not at all , she merely interests me as a person and a leader . I do n't share most of her beliefs . In my country , I have always been a supporter of our own green party ( Groen ) .  <p>  It 's all just very very terrible .

Police investigated but brought no charges . <p> He and a second man again approached reporters in 2008 with claims of abuse by Murray .

The man who was Murray 's foster son told the Times he thought what Murray  has done for the city of Seattle has been awesome , man . I feel for Seattle . I do .

18362527," What Are Students Rating When They Rate Instructors ? <h> By <p> Student evaluations of teaching , or SET , are n't short on critics . Many professors and other experts say they 're unreliable -- they may hurt female and minority professors , for example . One recent metastudy also suggested that past analyses linking student achievement to strong evaluation scores are flawed , a mere  artifact of small-sample-sized studies and publication bias .  <p> Now one of the authors of that metastudy is back for more , with a new analysis suggesting that SET ratings vary by course subject , with professors of math-related fields bearing the brunt of the effect . <p>  Professors teaching quantitative courses are far more likely not to receive tenure , promotion and/or merit pay when their performance is evaluated against common standards ,  reads the study , co-written by SET skeptic Bob Uttl , professor of psychology at Mount Royal University in Canada . <p> Uttl 's co-author for the new study is Dylan Smibert , a Ph.D . candidate in organizational and industrial psychology at Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the influence of course type on how students rated their instructors and related personnel decisions , Uttl and Smibert analyzed 14,872 publicly available class evaluations from New York University . Those summary evaluations were based on some 325,538 individual student ratings . Classes considered were those in math and statistics and English , history , and psychology , which the authors use as stand-ins for quantitative and nonquantitative fields , respectively . <p> They found that class subject is strongly associated with SET ratings and has a substantial impact on professors being labeled satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory and excellent vs. nonexcellent . The impact varies substantially depending on criteria on which the evaluations are based , the authors say , but the article not-so-subtly suggests that teaching quantitative courses is  hazardous  to one 's career . (  Student Evaluations of Teaching : Teaching Quantitative Courses Can Be Hazardous to One 's Career  is available online in PeerJ . ) <p> Professors teaching quantitative vs. nonquantitative courses are far more likely to fail norm-referenced cutoffs , the study says . They 're 1.88 times more likely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to fail the  excellent  standard , 3.17 times more likely to fail the  very good  standard , and 6.02 times more likely to fail the  good  standard . <p> Here are some of the questions asked in the NYU 's evaluations , along with mean ratings and standard deviations in the courses studied , on a scale of 1 ( poor ) to 5 ( excellent ) : <p> And here are distributions for those ratings based on the course subject . Notice that math is significantly to the left ( and lower than ) the vertical mean line : <p> The difference is starker when comparing only math and English , below . While 71 percent of English courses pass the overall mean as the standard , just 21 percent of math courses do .  The vast majority of math courses ( 79 percent ) earn their professors an ' unsatisfactory ' label in this scenario ,  the study says . <p> Uttl and Smibert note that previous research has found that irrelevant factors related to teaching effectiveness , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in student ratings ( and that student ratings are therefore reliable markers of teaching quality ) . But , the authors say , such research has been  plagued  by methodical shortcomings -- namely that it does n't account for  severe ceiling effects ,  or a large proportion of students giving professors the highest possible ratings . Other problems include that scaled ratings are often used to making  binary  decisions between good or bad teaching -- so a professor who missed a department 's mean SET rating by the narrowest of margins , for example , might be terminated while a colleague who scored marginally higher would be safe . Studies also often look at individual student ratings of teachers and not overall class summaries , the paper says . <p>  Our results show that math classes received much lower average class summary ratings than English , history , psychology or even all other classes combined , replicating previous findings showing that quantitative vs. nonquantitative classes receive lower SET ratings ,  the study reads .  More importantly , the distributions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  Whereas the SET distributions for nonquantitative courses show a typical negative skew and high mean ratings , it says , distributions for quantitative courses are less skewed , nearly normal , and have substantially lower ratings . <p> The passing rates for various common standards for effective teaching are substantially lower for professors teaching quantitative vs. nonquantitative courses , the authors add .  Clearly , professors who teach quantitative vs. nonquantitative classes are not only likely to receive lower SETs , but they are also at a substantially higher risk of being labeled ' unsatisfactory ' in teaching , and thus , more likely to be fired , not reappointed , not promoted , not tenured and denied merit pay .  <p> Such outcomes will be most apparent -- or unfair -- in departments in which some professors teach quantitative courses and others teach nonquantitative courses , such as psychology or sociology , suggests the study . <p> Is the answer , then , to do away with SETs ? At the very least , Uttl and Smibert say ,  fairness requires that we evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same subject rather than against some common standard .  <p> Used this way , they add ,  SET ratings can at least tell us where a professor stands within the distribution of other professors teaching the same subjects , regardless of what SETs actually measure .  <p> There are , of course , those who defend student ratings of instruction as important gauges of students ' classroom experiences . IDEA , a popular SET vendor , for example , offers relatively robust services in that it controls for things such as class size , provides comparative scores among instructors and offers specified feedback on ways to improve one 's teaching . <p> Ken Ryalls , IDEA 's president , said researchers have long known that certain courses and disciplines result in lower ratings for instructors for a variety of reasons . At the same time , he said , the discussion should n't be  whether or not to use student feedback in tenure and promotion decisions , but rather how to use the data .  That 's because  the student voice matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that  we use all student ratings cautiously when considering them in tenure and promotion decisions . Colleges should adjust the weight they give to student ratings of instruction depending on factors outside of the instructor 's control , including discipline .  <p> Uttl said Tuesday that the inescapable issue is still  what it is that SETs measure . Do they measure student satisfaction or do they measure professors ' teaching effectiveness ?  Consulting Merriam-Webster , he said satisfaction is  a fulfillment of a need or want  or  a happy or pleased feeling because of something that you did or something that happened to you  -- something very different from effective teaching . <p> Another problem , Uttl added , is that  there is no agreement as to what is effective teaching .  Strong teaching will vary with discipline , he said , and  we have no universal agreed-upon standard measure of effective teaching .  <p> If SETs measure satisfaction rather than professors ' teaching effectiveness , what should colleges and universities do ? Uttl said they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of one 's teaching .

@@18362528 <h> Trickle-Down Antagonism <p> Right-wing national organizations are directly influencing college and university GOP groups , giving them money and supplies to spread their messages , but on many campuses they seem more focused on attracting controversy than converts . <h> By <p> National right-wing organizations often view academe with disdain , seeing it as a place where right-wing values are squelched . Their interests lie more with Republican student groups , which they support with splashy signs and money to help espouse a particular brand of conservatism . <p> During last year 's presidential campaign , many of those GOP campus organizations pointedly declined to endorse Donald Trump , rejecting his statements about women , immigrants and Muslims , among others , as inconsistent with their principles . But these days , the speakers the groups invite to campus spout rhetoric just as harsh ( or worse ) than Trump 's . <p> Right-leaning campus groups said in interviews they do n't attempt to ignite discord , but that in planning certain events -- like the case of Ann Coulter 's canceled speech at University of California , Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their campuses . <p> Coulter 's scheduled talk at Berkeley captured headlines for days in late April after administrators initially canceled , then postponed , her speech amid safety concerns . Though Coulter eventually pulled out , protesters still converged on the public campus . The Berkeley College Republicans , who had invited her , with Young America 's Foundation , the national conservative advocacy group that helped fund her appearance , sued the university in federal court , alleging a violation of the First Amendment . <p> It 's sickening when a radical thuggish institution like Berkeley can so easily snuff out the cherished American right to free speech . <p> More recently , the Gettysburg College campus chapter of the Young America 's Foundation , called the Young Americans for Freedom , invited author Robert Spencer , whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled one of the country 's  most prolific and vociferous anti-Muslim propagandists .  Another popular choice among the students groups has been Milo Yiannopoulos , the former Breitbarteditor who stepped down from the right-wing news outlet after a video was unearthed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Berkeley Republicans also tried to bring Yiannopoulos to speak in February , but violent protests against him shut the campus down . The group did n't respond to multiple requests for comment , but its representatives spoke to the San Francisco Chronicle in April , telling the newspaper their provocative picks were deliberate -- only then could they generate a  dialogue ,  one student said . <p> GOP-affiliated students often do n't craft these events to advance discourse , though -- they 're designed to rile people up , said Amy J. Binder , an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California , San Diego . Binder saw Coulter speak at University of California , Irvine , in 2008 , as part of research for her book , Becoming Right : How Campuses Shape Young Conservatives ( Princeton University Press ) . <p> Then , too , Coulter had been requested by the college 's Republicans . Far from prompting intellectual debate , Coulter instead stirred the crowd into frenzy , repeatedly referring to President Obama 's middle name , Hussein , Binder said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather served as more of a political entertainer , she said . <p>  I know this sounds really quite extreme , but I whispered to the person I had come with that I know how fascism works now ,  Binder said of Coulter 's speech . <p> Students may maintain that the Coulter talk , and common campaigns , like an  affirmative action bake sale  -- in which white students are charged more for goodies than black or Latino students -- are productive , but really , they 're meant to poke at those on the other side of the political spectrum and hopefully goad them into responding in an uncivilized way , Binder said . <p> Such strategies may lose some campus goodwill , but likely among those that Republicans were n't trying to please anyway , Binder said . This also attracts media attention and donors for the groups -- a low-risk , high-reward scenario , she said . <p> National conservative organizations , like Young America 's Foundation , stoke mistrust between students and institutions , using language that evokes a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoctrinate you , Binder said . <p> On the Young America 's Foundation website , on a page discussing diversity , it encourages students to print out fliers that ask , who is really dividing campuses -- liberals or conservatives ? <p>  Leftist students , professors and administrators are often the first to intimidate , attack and silence conservatives when they speak out ,  the website reads .  What is diverse about a campus where people of different races or cultures all share the same point of view ? A university monopolized by leftist ideas is the antithesis of diversity .  <p> Campuses are ripe for this type of partisanship , said Arthur Levine , president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation . His research illustrates that the millennials dominating college campuses -- of all political stripes --  are unwilling to be made uncomfortable .  <p> Protests are n't necessarily more charged than they were back in the 1960s , however , the danger lies in the perception that leaders have clamped down on free speech , Levine said . <p> The Arrival of Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a prominent conservative campus group that has railed against college administrators for  targeting  right-wing students . <p> It has added hundreds of chapters since the national branch launched almost five years ago . In explaining Turning Point 's appeal , its founder , Charlie Kirk , said it is not confined to the Republican Party 's platform , but rather it follows tenets of small government and a free market . The group does n't touch social debates , either . Public polling continues to indicate more Americans fall left on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion . This endears the group to libertarians and even some moderates , Kirk said . <p>  We do n't put the Republican name in our brand , because what does even being a Republican mean anymore ? Ask and you 'll get 10 different answers ,  Kirk said in an interview . <p> But Kirk did speak at last year 's Republican National Convention , declaring before thousands that the only way to  take back  the country 's youth was to storm college campuses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter to identify young conservatives , picking out those who commented on the presidential debate , for instance , as candidates to lead campus chapters of Turning Point . Despite Turning Point 's quick expansion , Kirk defines it still as  grassroots  -- its most effective approach being its tabling events , where students can interact face-to-face with representatives . <p> Turning Point spends between $120,000 and $140,000 a year on materials , including  activism kits  that are mailed to colleges , Kirk said , containing buttons and fliers with  Big Government Sucks  and  Socialism Sucks  in stark , bold text . <p> It sets aside cash for local chapters , too , for initiatives like recruiting a speaker or paying for a student government campaign . <p> Campuses have not universally welcomed Turning Point . In March , the student government at Santa Clara University refused to recognize a Turning Point chapter as university affiliated , a decision later reversed by Jeanne Rosenberger , vice provost of student life . At Hagerstown Community College in Maryland , a student attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court after it did n't approve the chapter , calling it duplicative to other political clubs . Campus police had stopped the student from collecting signatures on a petition to support Turning Point . The college later settled the lawsuit by revising its policies on free speech . <p> At Ohio State University , Turning Point 's influence and money in the student government election roiled campus . Turning Point had apparently funded candidates who later dropped out . The co-presidents of the Young Democratic Socialists at Ohio State , in a biting letter to the student newspaperThe Lantern , called Turning Point homophobic and criticized perhaps its most infamous project , Professor Watchlist , a database of faculty from across the country whom the organization has deemed radical and demonstrating a liberal bias . <p>  How can we continue to allow such a group on campus that tries to secretly fund ... campaigns , is outwardly homophobic and is completely fine with a parent organization that targets professors ?  the students wrote . <p> Kirk in an interview waved away the criticism surrounding Ohio State , chalking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was  terribly misinterpreted .  He did n't elaborate further , but many Turning Point followers run for student government offices , he said . <p> And many misconstrue his group 's intentions , Kirk said . <p> He has been associated with the  alt-right ,  a far-right movement characterized by its racist views . The group has denounced perhaps the most prominent alt-right leader , Richard Spencer , and told him to  go to hell ,  Kirk said . <p> Never would any of the chapters call for the cancellation of lefty speakers , he said , adding that conservatives want to question those liberals . <p> Turning Point will regularly gather its members for training , in which students will listen to sound bites -- debunking socialism in 30 seconds , or how the U.S. Constitution has stood the test of time , Kirk said . <p>  Because there is a pattern of behavior from administration toward rejecting conservative ideas , intellectual diversity , because of that , we train our students to effectively fight back ,  he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- which Kirk referred to as one of the top in the country -- brought in Tomi Lahren , the conservative rabble-rouser who was fired from her job as a commentator for The Blaze , a TV network founded by Glenn Beck . <p> Giovanni Triana , a junior and president of the East Carolina Turning Point branch , said the group intentionally waited until two weeks prior to when Lahren was scheduled to start advertising , recognizing possible reactions . <p> In less than 48 hours after Lahren was announced , the group 's Twitter had exploded with vitriol , with some threatening to  burn  the university , Triana said . <p> He had expected some controversy , but the first week was  shocking .  After all , Triana said , another student group had arranged a campus appearance by black activist Angela Davis , and no one  batted an eye .  <p> Since the chapter 's inception two years ago , its membership has tripled , Triana said . At least 90 active students are now involved .

I genuinely wanted to show the importance of free speech -- this whole movement of censorship is very dangerous .  <p> He felt his group has the ear of administrators now , and applauded their commitment to a range of speakers . <p> Beyond East Carolina , other institutions are n't limiting conservatism in the way some groups suggest . <p> At Truman State University , in Missouri , the College Republicans there booked author Robert Spencer ( who is not related to Richard Spencer ) . The College Republicans at Truman State wanted someone to tackle the topic of radical Islam , said the group 's past chairman Benjamin Terrell , a rising senior . After vetting a few names , the group chose Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which helped pay for the event . The College Republicans chipped in $3,000 , and the foundation -- which told the group Spencer was an intellectual who would match Truman 's campus well -- covered the rest , Terrell said . <p> Despite Missouri 's conservative leanings , Truman State remains solidly liberal , Terrell said . Because they 're a political minority -- and because college students are often absorbed in their studies -- the campus Republicans need to  speak louder to be heard better ,  he said . <p> Terrell characterized the group 's relationship with Young America 's Foundation as positive -- he explained that because conservatism is often silenced on campus , the foundation 's language might come across strong . <p> When Truman State 's former president proposed hiring more professors of color , Terrell said his group opposed the idea of employing Latino and black faculty members as  diversity just for the sake of diversity .  It supports  diversity of thought ,  from various political and religious persuasions , Terrell said . <p> The president 's plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> The newly elected chairman of the Truman State Republicans , Korbin Keller , called the Spencer event  a good discussion .  <p> A Muslim student group on campus hired Faizan Syed , the executive director of Missouri 's branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations , to address campus directly prior to Spencer , in the same venue . Protests were minimal , Keller said . A contingent of people attended wearing all white , a show of solidarity , but remained quiet throughout Spencer 's talk . Questions to Spencer were a bit heated , but nothing was disrupted , Keller said . <p> People had called for the cancellation of Spencer 's appearance . <p>  I 'm glad our university did not follow that line ,  Keller said .  They chose intellectual and academic freedom in favor of a cushioned environment . I 'm glad that our administration did n't give in to demands .  <p> Though his group wo n't  shy away  from controversy , Keller said he 'd rather show the merits of Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , is the mentality of Christopher Gardner , president of the Hood College Republicans . <p> Gardner fielded heated criticism after his group last month hung a display in one of the campus buildings , a space used in rotation by other student groups .

Biology is biology ; men ca n't magically become women and women ca n't magically become men .  <p> Backlash was swift . <p> The community complained , and the president of Hood , Andrea Chapdelaine , notified campus that the college would investigate if the Republicans had broken school policy . <p> Laurie Ward , a spokeswoman for Hood , had declined to discuss that review , but Gardner said the college determined there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , an event Gardner called  awkward ,  as his group had already opened up their meeting to hear the campus ' grievances . <p> Gardner said he had n't reviewed all the materials before they were posted but said his group 's intent was to showcase that these views do exist -- his members do n't necessarily take stock in them . <p>  As an organization we do n't have a firm stance ,  Gardner said .  We 're diverse groups , with diverse thoughts and beliefs , and some of these things definitely deserve to be debated . Like the issue of being transgender . I personally do not have a position , but it needs to be discussed more -- there 's a lot misunderstood about it , a lot I do n't know about it .  <p> He does n't regret the display , but said  it could have been done better .  <p> Gardner wants the Hood College Republicans to be known as a positive force -- a partner to the college , and recognized for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than being eclipsed by a display . <p>  I think our mission has n't changed ,  he said .

Yoest , as president of Americans United for Life from 2008-2016 , played a key role in the enactment of scores of state laws restricting abortion access . Her appointment was lauded by Vice President Mike Pence , who declared in a speech ,  For the first time in a long time , America has an administration that 's filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life .  <p> -- Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad signed a bill banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy . A similar bill has reached the governor 's desk in Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar laws are in effect in at least a dozen other states , and Trump has promised to sign a federal 20-week ban if it can survive a potentially difficult path through Congress . <p> -- Republican lawmakers in Arizona and Iowa took steps to join a growing list of states that have acted to curtail public funding for Planned Parenthood , which is the leading provider of abortions in the U.S. but also provides a range of other health services that would be affected by the funding cuts . <p> In Iowa , the GOP plan is to create a state-run family planning program that excludes abortion-providing organizations such as Planned Parenthood . Iowa would give up federal Medicaid money and instead spend about $3.1 million in state funds . <p> In Arizona , GOP lawmakers have included a provision in the state budget that diverts about $2 million in federal funding away from Planned Parenthood .

He said those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenings and other non-abortion treatments . <p> Blanca Chico , a 39-year-old from Phoenix , said that as an uninsured patient , Planned Parenthood Arizona has given her health services at a reduced cost that she can afford .

And they only ask for a donation for the services .  <p> Chico , who also has used the clinic for annual checkups and pap tests , said the proposed cuts would force her to find another provider . <p>  It 's very complicated finding a place that is low cost and that I feel confident I can get the services ,  Chico said .

A state report later found that 30,000 fewer women were served through a Texas women 's health program after the changes . Planned Parenthood now has 35 clinics in Texas and served more than 126,000 individual patients last year , including those seeking abortions . <p> Under the GOP-backed health care bill that cleared the House last week , people who rely on Medicaid would be unable to get subsidized preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers -- including birth control , cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases . Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that defunding Planned Parenthood would save roughly $200 million in federal spending while reducing health care for perhaps 390,000 people . <p> The bill 's fate is uncertain , with senators of both parties saying the House version will not survive in its current form .

Anthony List . Dannenfelser and other leading anti-abortion activists threw their support behind Trump in last year 's election in part because of his pledge to sign a defunding measure . <p> Planned Parenthood and its allies have been organizing protests at the offices of Republican members of Congress who voted for the new health care bill . <p>  This is the worst bill for women 's health in a generation ,  said Planned Parenthood 's president , Cecile Richards .

As evidence , they cite Trump 's appointment of federal judges who are widely viewed as receptive to further restrictions on abortion . <p>  Folks are excited that we 've got a different administration , so there 's a sense of optimism ,  said Melanie Israel of the conservative Heritage Foundation .

I 'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed . I hope you wo n't either ,  Comey wrote in the letter .  It is done , and I will be fine , although I will miss you and the mission deeply .  <p> Comey encouraged the recipients of the letter to go on with their mission and said he would miss it , and added that working for the FBI has been  one of the great joys of my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aiello reported , the White House said Trump asked for something in writing when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended the firing on Monday . Trump dropped the axe on Tuesday . <p> On Wednesday morning , Trump said he fired Comey because he  was n't not doing a good job .  <p> Trump made the remarks to reporters in the Oval Office with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger after a closed meeting with Russia 's foreign minister . <p>  Very simply he was not doing a good job ,  Trump said in his first in-person statement to the press since Comey 's firing Tuesday . <p> The president tweeted earlier Wednesday morning that Republicans and Democrats will soon  be thanking me  for the firing , saying Comey  lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington , Republican and Democrat alike .  <p> Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington , Republican and Democrat alike .

U.S. Rep.

18366047," Since I 've been involved in politics and opinion writing , I 've leaned firmly Left . I also identify as pro-life , although I have n't always been . For years , I self-described as pro-choice , supporting the once-Democratic platform of  legal , safe and rare .  About two years ago I finally got honest with myself that abortion just did n't sit well with me personally , morally , and as a human rights advocate . This change did n't occur based on any religious ideas . Rather , it was science ( the ultrasound ) that directed me . <p> It seems that science , or the lack thereof , leads to the brutal dystopian world of  The Handmaid 's Tale .  Main character Offred narrates the episodic series . In the first episode , we learn she is expecting . In revealing her pregnancy , she confesses to her best friend Moira that she is concerned about miscarrying . <h> The World of ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' <p> Offred 's concern is justified . As the story progresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases , and famine , women 's reproductive systems changed , and birth rates significantly declined . Only a minority of women are fertile . Most women either miscarry , or the baby dies within a few hours of birth . <p> Offred is one of the minority who can carry to term . She gives birth to a healthy baby girl . But by the time Offred has given birth , the government has become a dictatorial police state . Christian fundamentalists known as the  Sons of Jacob  have amassed tremendous power . It 's a far cry from the Founding Fathers ' writing and the American Constitution that preserves our God-given rights . As Offred notes , the change began with a military coup sold as necessary to protect Americans from terrorism , then the Constitution was voided , and no one blinked an eye . That 's how democracy died . <p> Women are forbidden to work . Whatever money they owned was transferred to their male spouse or nearest male kin . Homosexuality is banned and punishable by death . Freedom of speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is illegal . Why would it be necessary ? The majority of women are infertile . <p> Offred , with her husband and young child , attempt to escape this totalitarian theocratic culture but the  Sons of Jacob  are inescapable . In this world of darkness , somehow the message of purity of creation and life manifests . <h> Inside This Evil World , There Is Still Some Good <p> Even though I expected from  The Handmaid 's Tale  a story that personified feminism , a battle cry for the resistance movement , and an anthem to the importance of democracy , instead the program 's message supports an inheritance of life that enhances the plot . <p> Of course , there is no doubt that the Sons of Jacob are evil . Forcing the minority of fertile women into slavery and raping them is deplorable and a misinterpretation of doctrine , a fault many fundamentalist groups have made for generations . Negligence and pride result from such sordid and twisted decisions . <p> That said , the undercurrent is clear : a child is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-life philosophy is n't the intent of the story , but it nevertheless personifies that theme , albeit quietly . The Wives of the Commanders , who are infertile , long to become mothers . For obvious reasons , I do n't support stripping a birth mother of her child after giving birth . However , I can not deny these women 's desire to become parents and not just because of the rules of the regime but because of a love for God and creation . The way they dote on newborns is proof they have hearts . <p> I understand the change of climate has affected these women personally . They are incapable of giving their husband a child naturally . Thus , they 've become desperate and scared . Remember , women have no power in this new world order , and most of the higher-class women are unable to conceive . Still , just because they 're infertile does n't mean the desire to become a mother eventually dies .

She 's a victim of rape , yet cherishes the child that rape produced . Regardless of the situation she 's in , it does n't spoil her enjoyment of the baby growing in her womb . Irrespective of the situation she 's in as a victim of rape , Janine does n't give in to pressure to consider the baby a sin from a sinful regime of oppression . <p> I realize Janine 's possible mental illness sparks debate . But there is nothing mental when Janine explained to Offred why she bit the hand of the mistress who forcefully took her child out of her arms as they were breastfeeding . That was a mother bear reaction , the protector shining through . Janine is willing to do anything to protect her child , including risking her own life and living in denial thinking her abuser loves her . <p> I know plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for finding a blessing in a child conceived in rape . I want to be clear that I 'm not a religious fundamentalist . Rape is a crime , and as pro-choice advocates believe women who conceive in rape should have the right to seek an abortion . But a rape victim also has every right to make another decision besides abortion without being shamed for it . <p> I found Janine brave and emotionally fragile . On this subject , we have become too decentralized and too partisan . It seems women are n't granted the right to see their child as a blessing if conceived in rape .

Bidwell Street at their April 25 meeting in response to confusion . <p> Emergency service personnel have found that three Folsom streets -- Scott Road , Scott Street and Scott Court -- are ' extremely problematic ' because they cause confusion when a 911 caller can not appropriately identify the street type , according to a staff report produced by the Community Development Department . During the March 28 City Council meeting , the development department requested approval from the council on the renaming of Scott Road , as well as the appropriation $50,000 for new freeway signs . The vote resulted in a tie and failed to pass . <p> The council revisited the request at the April 25 meeting and was approved with a 4-1 vote . Vice Mayor Kerri Howell voted against it . <p>  When the City of Folsom annexed the Folsom Plan Area , emergency services found it confusing and it would have an impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city engineer . <p> The name was originally going to be renamed North Scott Road , but emergency services conveyed that the challenge implementing this approach would be that callers would not provide the entire street name when reporting an incident or emergency . <p> Emergency services felt strongly that E. Bidwell Street would be the more appropriate solution . <p>  We all decided E. Bidwell Street would be an appropriate change because it would be an extension of the road name all the way to White Rock Road . No one lives on White Rock Road , so it would n't really affect anyone .  <p> With the changing of the street name , the city must change the freeway signs , which Caltrans roughly estimated a cost of $50,000 for a total of eight overhead signs as well as four ramp signs , Krahn said . <p> The development department is currently working with Caltrans on timing and exact costs , but it will be a couple months before the signs are changed . 
@@18377094 <p> Storing information using quantum properties of subatomic particles and atoms -- the key prerequisite for building a quantum computer -- is extremely hard , primarily because these properties are typically very fragile . Although physicists have , in recent years , succeeded in effectively demonstrating quantum control of individual atoms , they face an added level of complexity when it comes to doing the same with molecules . <p> Now , in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature , a team of physicists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in Boulder , Colorado , describe a successful attempt at using previously known techniques to cool and control molecular ions . <p> The successful experiment , which involved using a laser to gently probe molecular ions to detect their quantum states indirectly , could pave the way for the creation of much more complex and computationally faster quantum computers . <p>  We developed methods that are applicable to many types of molecules .

It 's our dream to achieve all these things with molecules .  <p> Of course , controlling and observing quantum states is much harder for molecules than it is for atoms , primarily because molecules consist of many combinations of atoms . For instance , the calcium hydride molecular ion ( made of one calcium ion and one hydrogen ion bonded together ) used by NIST in their experiments has 100 possible rotational states . <p> While this property ensures that molecular ions offer more options than atomic ions insofar as storing and converting quantum information is concerned , it also makes observing transitions in their quantum states without destroying them an extremely daunting task . <p> In order to do so , the researchers first confined a calcium hydride ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of their physical proximity in the ion trap and the repulsive interaction of their electrical charges , the two ions developed a pendulum-like shared motion . The researchers then used a laser to cool the atomic ion , which , in turn , caused the molecule to drop to its lowest-energy state . <p> Once this was achieved , the researchers used tuned pulses of infrared laser light that targeted only one unique transition out of the 100 possible ones in the molecule 's rotation . When the transition to the targeted state occurred , some energy was transferred to the ions ' shared motion , and they started moving again . Another laser pulse was then used to convert the change in the shared motion into a change in the atomic ion 's internal energy level -- which was manifested in the form of light scattered by the atomic ion . <p> An illustration showing the steps involved in cooling and controlling molecular ions to observe their quantum states .

Moreover , the method should be applicable to a large group of molecules without changing the setup .

With considerable interest and enthusiasm , I have noted the continued success of the event since it was created . <p> In May , 1971 , 96 seniors from 18 Southern Illinois high schools were recognized in the first annual awards banquet -- the culmination of a series of meetings arriving at a program whereby area schools could select students who were academic and citizenship achievers . <p> I attest to the fact that The Southern Illinoisan has played a large part in development of the program from the onset . As principal of Carbondale Community High School-East , I met with Editor John Gardner to discuss the idea of a recognition program for high school students who were high achievers . Gardner assured me of The Southern Illinoisan 's full support . ( See archived editorial in May 18 , 1971 , newspaper . ) <p> With the capable assistance and guidance of Barnie P. Genisio , superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of Benton High School , chairman of the planning committee , and with the Southern Illinoisan 's support and Southern Illinois University 's cooperation , the first awards banquet came to fruition . <p> Since that momentous beginning in 1971 , there has been an ongoing positive acceptance of the Southern Illinois Society for Scholarship . Case in point : in 2017 , 200 seniors representing 32 schools received awards ! Recognizing the energy , perseverance and cooperative spirit of those who were involved in the beginning and with the continued support of high schools , the Southern Illinoisan and SIU , it is rewarding to know that the initial effort developed into a successful tradition that is nearing the half-century mark . <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox <p> TheSouthern.com Daily Headlines <p> Obituaries <p> I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy . <h> Watch this discussion.Stop watching this discussion . <h> ( 0 ) comments <h> Welcome to the discussion . <p> Keep it Clean .

He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially . <p> In Thursday 's statement to WND , the district said ,  Ruff , the school board , administration and all members of the Downingtown Area School District would like to put this terribly unfortunate incident in the past to enable everyone to move forward .  <p> The statement , delivered by Patricia McGlone , explained the district held a hearing on the allegations against Ruff .

We do n't believe in that here .  <p> Ruff later disappeared abruptly from the video while the pro-life students were engaged in conversation with another student . <p>  No one should ever be harassed and berated by a government employee on a public sidewalk simply for peacefully engaging in one of the most common free-speech activities ,  said ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot .  The severity of this situation , as easily seen in the video , makes what we are requesting of the school district so necessary . This can never happen again , and the school district should ensure that both Conner and Lauren -- as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech -- feel confident that it wo n't .  <p> The letter explains that American courts , based on the Constitution , consider oral communication , literature distribution and displaying hand-held signs protected activities . <p> The school announcement on Thursday actually defended Ruff , explaining ,  It is clear to us that Dr. Ruff decided that the best thing for his students , the school district , and the community was to resign from employment effective at the close of business on Thursday , May 11 , 2017 .  <p> The school statement continued :  In reviewing the video , Dr. Ruff knew that the conduct he displayed was not representative of who he is and was not representative of the kind of educational leader he prided himself on being . Dr. Ruff has acknowledged that the demonstrators had a right to be on a public sidewalk . He acknowledged that his conduct can not be defended or condoned and he deeply regretted his actions as displayed on the video .

NSEERS was briefly floated late last year as a potential framework for executing candidate Trump 's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country . The White House eventually settled on a more targeted ban on travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries and refugees from Sryia , although the federal courts have hit pause on it . <p> Over the last decade , Kobach has emerged as one of the country 's most influential immigration hawks and a crusader for stricter voter identification laws .

His work spearheading Trump 's committee will be highly scrutinized from the outset , mostly because the initiative seems to have come about as a means of justifying the President 's bogus charge that as many as 5 million  illegals  voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 . <p> During a January meeting with top lawmakers in Washington , Trump sought to back the claim by relaying a story purportedly told by a friend of German golfer Bernhard Langer , the product of an apparent game of telephone that Langer quickly disputed . <p> Still , Trump persisted with the allegations , never providing any evidence to back to the claim or dispute a Brennan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 0.00004% and 0.0009% -- effectively nil . <p> Pence , who will head the commission , reportedly told Republicans at a policy retreat in January he expected the administration would  initiate a full evaluation of voting rolls in the country , the overall integrity of our voting system in the wake of this past election .  <p> And while the full breadth of the new  Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity  is still a little fuzzy , Kobach 's presence offers some insight into its ambitions . <p> Kobach is perhaps best known for his using his position in Kansas to help shape law in states across the country . He was involved in the writing of Arizona 's SB 1070 , a law ( even after being mostly struck down by the Supreme Court ) that allows police to ask individuals for proof of citizenship if there is a  reasonable suspicion  they are in the country without documentation . <p> In Trump , the lawyerly Kobach has found a temperamental opposite , but staunch ideological ally .

18392200," Verify : Would California lose tax credits because of the AHCA ? <p> As the GOP-led American Health Care Act , which would repeal and replace Obamacare , makes its way to the Senate after passing in the House , this tweet from California 's senior senator caught our attention : <p> So we decided to dig into her claim . Could the state really miss out on tax credits for covering reproductive health care ? <p> Here 's what we found out : <p> First , we reached out to Sen. Feinstein 's office . Spokeswoman Ashley Schapitl pointed us to page 73 of the AHCA , which states that health insurance companies could offer a plan that covers abortion , as long as it  not paid for  with any tax credits . <p> The bill 's language also says that a health insurance company could offer a separate abortion coverage plan . <p> But , California and New York are the only states that require health insurance companies to cover abortion care . <p>  This language essentially says that no subsidies can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So because of state law , a health insurer could not offer a health insurance plan without abortion coverage . <p>  It 's directly at odds with the state ,  University of California , Los Angeles health professor Nadereh Pourat said .

@@18392203 <p> Ah , ze Germans . They 're a strict people , with rules that can not be broken and customs that ca n't possibly under any circumstance be challenged . Some of those rules and customs deal with auto safety regs , which a number of American soldiers are realizing , are very strict . <p> Advertisement <p> The Polizei has given American Army soldiers stationed in Kaiserslautern a warning : if they try to drive overly-modified cars on public streets , they risk being pulled over . This , according to the U.S. Military news outlet Stars and Stripes , who says Kaiserslautern police is establishing a  souped-up car unit  of 10 officers to pull over illegally modified vehicles on local streets . <p> The newspaper says the police force in the town already issued a statement in the spring , warning locals that illegal car mods , such as hacked up exhausts and tinted windows , would not be tolerated . <p> Advertisement <p> Though police claim they 're not targeting Americans , Stars and Stripes points out that the statement last spring  included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation .  Not to mention , chief of Kaiserslautern 's highway patrol told the newspaper that American cars -- which make up close to 15 percent of the car scene in the town --  often are souped-up in a much more extreme way than the German cars .  <p> He then went on to give some examples of these  extreme  mods , mentioning loud exhausts , tinted windows and enormous throaty V8s . Yes , the German police does n't want American V8s belching their wonderful symphony on German streets . <p> Some Army soldiers , unsurprisingly , are n't too thrilled with these strict rules , with a number of soldiers saying they feel harassed , citing the heavily-advertised  meet the street  event they held in the spring . The show did n't end well for U.S. military personnel ( who made up about 15 percent of the total show attendance ) , with Stars and Stripes describing the scene , referencing civilian Jeremy Bisson and Staff Sgt. Kyle Helms : <p> Sponsored <p> The Americans  roll out there  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military police vehicles on scene , Bisson said . <p> Police blocked the entrance to the parking lot and issued citations for any vehicle modifications they deemed illegal , Bisson said . <p> Bisson had to sand and scratch off the spray-paint tint on his tail lights in order to drive the car home . He also had to pay an 80-euro fine . <p> Helms said he was hit with a 105-euro fine for yellow fog lights on his Volkswagen Golf GTI. ? <p> Part of this struggle comes down to a huge difference in the way America treats vehicle inspections , with Sgt. Matthew Maynard -- who works at the vehicle inspection station on post -- reminiscing upon the freedom he had in the states , saying : <p> Advertisement <p> In Wyoming , you get a tag at Walmart ... You do what you want .

Not only does the inspection flunk you if there 's a single rust hole in a body panel , but it checks headlight aim , brake torque ( yes , they put the vehicle on the machine to measure brake strength ) , and makes sure no fluids are leaking . <p> Advertisement <p> Where TUV is especially strict is in its rules towards car mods . If , for example , you decide you want to bore out or turbocharge your little Ford Ka motor , good luck passing the emissions tests . If , you somehow bribe someone to get past that test , you 'd better make sure you 've updated your brakes and suspension components to handle the grunt . <p> Even if you 've done all that , you 'll still have to carry a little booklet in your car outlining every car modification you have -- wheels , suspension parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by the TUV inspector , it ca n't be on your car . <p> American servicemembers ' vehicles have to pass all the same safety tests as German cars do , except the difference is that last bit about the booklet of modifications .

If we stop ( an American ) , it says ' unit , license plate , chassis number . ' That 's it .  ? ? <p> So while Germans are expected to be accountable for every part on their car , American soldiers are not , and that 's a problem . Another problem is that some German police are n't familiar with American cars , with the news site describing a man whom police stopped three times for  vents in the hood ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stars and Stripes says that , everytime he 's pulled over , the owner  has to pull up the stock image of the car on his smartphone to avoid a citation , to prove the vents came with the car .  <p> Advertisement <p> But this dilemma is n't just German police officers ' faults ; some Americans are  taking advantage of the system .  One driver , Stars and Stripes reports , takes his car in for inspection with a quiet muffler , but bolts on the loud one after he 's done . To avoid being pulled over by German police , he  just makes sure he is in high gear so his RPMs are low or he 'll put in the clutch , so it 's really quiet .  <p> It 's a tough situation , because you ca n't blame Germans for not wanting a town filled with ridiculously loud muscle cars , and modifications bought from sketchy Chinese Ebay sellers , but at the same time , Americans will always be hard-pressed to give up the freedoms to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stripes notes , for a lot of these soldiers , cars can be a huge stress relief . Staff Sgt. Chris Bearss ' told the newspaper about his Ford Mustang GT , which he 's modified to produce 800 horsepower .

He was invited to an exclusive dinner with Trump 's future Cabinet members on Jan. 18 , days after the changes were proposed . Kelly was one of the Cabinet members who mingled with top donors at the event . <p> The Palm Beach Post reported last month that the two sat at the same table .

Legislative leaders confirmed after a meeting with top aides to Gov . Greg Abbott that they were planning to pass whatever version they can and get through - and then work out their differences with the Senate as the two chambers negotiate a final version . <p>  The property tax bill is one of the main bills holding up a deal on the budget , and until we can get those issues resolved , we ca n't make real progress on the budget ,  said a Capitol insider who is involved in the negotiations .  We 're working to make the pieces come together , but it 's a slow process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thursday 's bill-passing deadline , saying that tensions increase every session at this time . Even so , Senate leaders continued ramping up their efforts to pass more than 600 House bills they have received in the last two weeks - a number they said sets a record . <p> Unlike the last legislative session in 2015 , when the governor kept a low profile , lawmakers in both chambers said Thursday that Abbott and his aides are now involved in trying to broker deals on many of the most contentious issues that remain . Their goal is to ensure that the governor wins approval for priorities ranging from an additional $220 million for pre-K programs to a new law that makes committing a crime against a police officer a hate crime . <p> Vouchers resurface <p> Also potentially imperiled in the late-session crush was a wide-reaching school finance overhaul that the House overwhelmingly approved last month . <p> Sen.

It also would provide more money for students with dyslexia or those who are learning English as a second language . <p> With tensions rising as the House 's midnight deadline neared , the fate of dozens of House bills appeared grim as the debate inched along on a 25-page calendar that normally might take more than a day to complete . <p> On that list were bills that would ban suspensions of public school students because of low grades , legalize fantasy sports games and provide school lunches for students even if they have no money to pay . <p> Anti-abortion victory <p> Three other controversial measures also remained in doubt , including bills that provide legal protection for doctors who deliver babies with birth defects , ban the sale of fetal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill as an act that kills a partially delivered fetus . That late-term procedure already is prohibited under federal law . <p> The fetal tissue measure , House Bill 200 , was filed after a years-long battle between the state and Planned Parenthood clinics on the procurement of fetal tissue . <p> Despite growing tensions , which legislative leaders on Wednesday had characterized as leaving the Legislature close to a meltdown , at least two controversial bills were agreed to : One that would require health care centers to report abortion complications and another that could settle an ongoing fight over a bailout for the Dallas police and fire system . <p> Despite two hours of tense House debate , the abortion reporting measure by Rep. Giovanni Capriglione , R-Southlake , passed on a 94-52 vote -marking a victory for discouraged anti-abortion advocates who had feared the Thursday deadline might doom the bill . <p> House Bill 2962 had been a high priority for anti-abortion groups .

The report would also include the patient 's birth date , race , marital status and county . <p> Foes of the amendment argued that physicians names could be released .

Find out what 's happening in the world as it unfolds . <p> ( CNN ) As my mother lay dying in September , we surrounded her with song . <p> Music had filled her life and often our household .

A longtime Detroit-area attorney and activist , she fought on front lines and danced circles around courtroom opponents . <p> She advocated for abortion access , rallied for the Equal Rights Amendment and marched for civil rights on behalf of many , including the LGBTQ communities .

My little sister and I caressed her hands and sang  You Are My Sunshine ,   Somewhere Over the Rainbow  and lullabies she once offered to comfort us . <p> Until about a week before her death , my mother , too , had been singing -- and her songs told a story . She belted out Frank Sinatra 's  New York , New York ,  a nod to the city she grew up near , the one she always held dear even though Michigan was her home for half a century . <p> She sang old standards like  Side by Side ,  which her father had crooned to her and her sister when they were growing up in Elizabeth , New Jersey .

In my mother 's case , it was as if each selection her brain called up represented a chapter in her 74 years .

He strolls into Rose Court with his guitar and takes a seat at the piano anywhere from 15 to 20 hours a month . <p> Our powerhouse of a mother , who 'd become so fragile and meek , stood out . <p>  I ca n't think of anyone who 's interacted with me the way she did ,  Krieger said .

It was the one thing she could still grasp , and it was as if she were announcing to the world ,  I 've got this .  <h> A puzzle with no specific answers <p> Though her brain prohibited her from saying much , she comprehended everything happening around her , said Dawn Doyle , the social worker at Rose Court who observed my mother closely . <p>  Music allowed her to feel emotion ,  Doyle said .

There 's no specific answer ,  Doyle said .  But the fact that there was a connection showed she had some cognitive ability . It was her way of trying to connect with you .  <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Music opens a ' back door ' to the brain <h> MUST WATCH <p> CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta , a practicing neurosurgeon , sat down with me to explain why music stuck with my mom when most everything else did not . <p> He said studies have shown that music fires up the brain like nothing else .

It 's why music can be so effective in rehabilitation .

Then , expressing or speaking the lyrics stimulates the brain 's left temporal area . To speak those lyrics in the form of a tune taps into the right parietal lobe . And if you throw in a rhythm , say the stomping of a foot or clapping , that draws in the cerebellum . <p> Singing crosses the mid line of the brain , Gupta said , and not much else does this . <p>  It 's really remarkable to watch ,  he said . <p> Indeed , in her final chapter and up until a week before we lost our mother , we gazed at her in wonder . <h> Saying goodbye <p> The end for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit up , my sister and my mom 's best friend sang with her one last time .

She sang to us in our beds , as her father had to her , as she did for him in his last days . And as she lay dying , it was our turn . <p> We stroked her hair , kissed her cheeks , whispered in her ears our gratitude for everything she 'd given us . And the songs that filled the room as we said goodbye , the music that defined her life , became ours , too .

@@18399569 <h> The Secret Weapon Democrats Do n't Know How to Use <p> No Democrat in the House of Representatives did what Cheri Bustos did last November . She was n't the sole member of her party to win in a congressional district Donald Trump also took -- there were 11 others -- but she was the only one to post a 20-point landslide , and she did it in agricultural , industrial , blue-collar northwestern Illinois . In the kind of place where Hillary Clinton lost big last fall and where Democrats have been losing in droves for the last decade , Bustos has done just the opposite . A former newspaper reporter , the wife of a county sheriff and the mother of three grown sons , the 55-year-old third-term representative has won by wider margins every time she 's run . And this past election , she notched victories not only in the urban pockets she represents -- Rock Island and Moline of the Quad Cities , plus pieces of Rockford and Peoria -- but in all her rural counties , too . If Democrats are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party strategists , it 's going to happen in large part by doing more of whatever it is Bustos is doing three hours west of Chicago in her nearly 7,000-square-mile district of small towns and soybean fields . <p> So twice in the first four months of this year , I traveled to her district to watch her work . In January , on a frigid Saturday the week before Trump 's inauguration , I accompanied her in a silver , staffer-driven Ford Taurus , as she donned a yellow hard hat and installed an air filter in a locomotive in Galesburg ( the latest in a regular series of appearances she calls  Cheri on Shift  ) , stationed herself in a grocery store produce section to introduce herself to customers at a Hy-Vee in Canton (  Supermarket Saturdays  ) and swung by a pub in Peoria to talk with a group of activist women . And last month , on a rainy Wednesday , I joined her again , when she put on a pair of safety goggles for a tour of an aerospace factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , population 9,266 . <p> The Bustos blueprint , she told me in January as the Taurus dodged raccoon road kill outside a speck of a village called Maquon , is rooted in unslick , face-to-face politicking . She shows up . She shakes hands . She asks questions -- a lot of questions .  Do n't talk down to people -- you listen ,  she stressed . When she does talk , she talks as much as she can about jobs and wages and the economy and as little as she can about guns and abortion and other socially divisive issues -- which , for her , are  no-win conversations ,  she explained . And at a time when members of both parties are being tugged toward their respective ideological poles , the more center-left Bustos has picked her spots to buck such partisanship . She 's a pro-choice Catholic and an advocate for limited gun control , but she has supported the Keystone pipeline and called for improvements to Barack Obama 's  imperfect  Affordable Care Act . It 's worked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation from outside Chicagoland . <p> Rick Jasculca , a Chicago-based Democratic political consultant who worked in the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton , told me he considers Bustos  the future of the party .  <p>  She offers something the party needs , in a region of the country where it needs it desperately ,  said Robin Johnson , a political science professor at Monmouth College in Monmouth , Illinois , and one of Bustos ' closest confidants .  If you 're going to get back to a majority in the House , you 're going to have to win some rural areas -- and all this comes through the Midwest .  <p> Left : Cheri spotwelding on a pickup truck at Dave 's Auto Body in Galesburg , Illinois . Right : Cheri on a forklift at KMI Packaging and Exporting in Pekin , Illinois . Cheri previously earned her certification as a forklift driver . Cheri Bustos ' Office <p> Democratic leaders seem to acknowledge this -- that Bustos could help them build back a geographically broader electoral appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi chose Bustos to be a co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee , after which she was elected by her peers . Her assignment is to teach other members of her caucus essentially how to talk to people like the shoppers she encounters by the bananas at the Hy-Vee . In some ways this was a confirmation of an existing though less formal role . Bustos , the single Midwesterner in House Democratic Leadership , already was a co-chair of the  Red to Blue  initiative of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and now she 's ramping up her role in the organization 's rural and heartland outreach efforts . Her national television and radio appearances have spiked . She 's been dubbed one of the party 's rising stars . <p> It remains to be seen , though , whether her party 's most powerful shot-callers ultimately will actually implement key tactics of hers in time for the 2018 midterms . Democratic Congressman Ron Kind , who 's won for 20 years in western Wisconsin in a district Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing openness and willingness in the caucus  to incorporate some of what has worked for Bustos and others like her -- Kind ran unopposed last year -- but he worries , he told me , about his party succumbing to  the temptation to lurch to the left in response to Trump .  Congressman Rick Nolan of Minnesota , another of the dozen Trump-district Democrats , lamented his colleagues ' general lack of interest in tapping into the expertise of the few who have won in Upper Midwest .  I could count , easily , on one hand ,  Nolan told me ,  the number of candidates for public office from the Democratic Party who 've come up to me and said , you know , ' How did you do that ? '  One of them , he added , was Bustos .  Democrats ,  said Denny Heck , the congressman from Washington who has worked with Bustos on  Red to Blue ,   would very considerably benefit if they listened to her .  Bustos recently met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office saw as  a starting point  in what she and her staff hope will be an ongoing discussion . <p> This is a moment , of course , of existential angst for Democrats . They 're unified mainly by their antipathy toward Trump . Beyond that , they 're grappling with the much more complicated calculus of whether to focus on stoking the Trump-hating base or re-embrace a more moderate approach and earn back the votes of traditional Democrats they 've leached practically everywhere but cities and the coasts . Ben Ray Lujan , the New Mexico congressman who heads the DCCC , is clear about where he stands on this .  I can assure you ,  he said when we talked last week ,  that the direction I 'm giving is that we need to go back and re-establish trust and earn trust with people all over the country , including rural and blue-collar Americans .

Kennedy poster while drinking coffee from an Abraham Lincoln mug . <p>  I 've had fellow members who are very upset with me ,  she continued .  I 've had somebody say , ' Are you even a Democrat ? '  <p> She would n't tell me who that was . She just said she told the person she 's been a Democrat her whole life .  But maybe ,  she said ,  I 'm a little bit of a different kind of Democrat .  <p> I asked if she feels like she 's being listened to -- if she thinks her model will be embraced and implemented elsewhere .

I think what 's going to get us to 218 is to understand these tough districts where we have not done well .  <p> She cited as evidence last month 's special election in Kansas . The Democrat won Wichita but lost everywhere else .  That candidate bombed in all those rural areas ,  Bustos said bluntly .  If he just did n't bomb in those rural areas , we could 've won that .  <p> *** <p> If you reverse-engineered a Democrat capable of winning in Illinois ' 17th congressional district at this anti-elitist , politically volatile time , you could n't do a whole lot better than Bustos . <p> She 's the granddaughter of a hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , out-of-the-way and predominantly Republican county in eastern Illinois .

Simon and Dixon , and a young Dick Durbin , too , were regulars at her house , talking politics around the kitchen table of her childhood . <p> Before she graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in political science and from the University of Illinois at Springfield with a master 's in journalism , she went to Illinois College , where she played volleyball and basketball and was picked as the MVP for both as well as the school 's top female-student athlete .

In 2012 , she beat Schilling -- because of redistricting that added parts of more Democrat-friendly Rockford and Peoria , because Obama was on the ballot and made for a more favorable national turnout , and because she was assiduous in talking about jobs , agriculture and infrastructure while steering clear of the flashpoint social issues . In her victory speech at the Rock Island Holiday Inn , she told supporters she intended to reach across the aisle in Washington .

A fifth of the people in her district who voted for Trump also voted for her . <p>  She was getting white male voters when they were abandoning our party in rural America ,  said Doug House , the Rock Island County Democratic Party chair and the president of the Illinois Democratic County Chairmen 's Association .  They were for Trump -- and they were for her . She was connecting with them .  <p>  The key in these districts ,  said Kind , the congressman from Wisconsin ,  is you have to be able to connect with your constituents on a basic-value level , so they understand that you get them .  <p> Joe Manchin , the senator from West Virginia who consistently has won as a Democrat in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump , told me Bustos has been able to win because of a certain  likeability factor  and an intangible authenticity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bustos sits on the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure . She toggles deftly between unions and chambers of commerce . She 's been endorsed by the Illinois Farm Bureau , and the Illinois Sierra Club --  not easy to do ,  she said . She organizes an annual economic summit at Augustana College in Rock Island , and she spent last August trekking around her district on what her office titled a  21st Century Heartland Tour .  Last fall , she was noncommittal about how she would have voted on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal , but she called it a  tough one for me ,  given the state of industry in her district .  We have been hit very , very hard in this part of the state of Illinois , and in the state of Illinois ,  she told the Quad-City Times in 2015 ,  because of what I would call bad trade deals .  <p> Less than a month after her 2016 win , Bustos discussed this in an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working-class men and women for the entire history of our party ,  Bustos said .  My dad raised us to say if it were n't for organized labor and the Democratic Party , there would n't be a middle class . I believe that . But we 've got to go where people are . And we 've got to listen .  <p> *** <p>  Watch the pinch points ,  one of the workers told her at the locomotive repair factory in Galesburg in January , as Bustos gamely ( but not quite successfully ) attempted to insert the large air filter while wearing the yellow hard hat and an orange safety vest that paired awkwardly with her gold hoop earrings . <p>  What am I doing wrong ?  Bustos asked . <p> An employee gave the filter a final necessary nudge and told Bustos she had done well for her  first time .  The bright white gloves she had been given were black with soot and grime . <p>  Cheri on Shift  feels a little like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , it 's a photo op . At this one , I was n't the only reporter . There also was a local public radio correspondent . But what was different about this  Cheri on Shift  photo op was the patter of her questions . It was constant . She quizzed the supervisors leading the tour and the employees we encountered . What do you do here ? How long have you been with the company ? Do you like it ? Can you support your family ? Can you go on vacation ? Who works here ? Who do you like hiring ? You guys like hiring farm kids ? How long does it take to train for one of these jobs ? Anything else on your minds ? <p>  Being present matters  -- that 's how DCCC 's Lujan put it when we talked .  Cheri gets that ,  he said . <p> It 's more than presence , from what I observed . Bustos in essence  reports  the story of her district so she can better tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her how she talks about the thorniest subjects for her , and for any Democrat in a district like the 17th of Illinois . How , I wanted to know , does she talk about the issues that her party sometimes thinks are most important -- but that her constituents see differently ? <p> I started with guns . <p>  I say , ' My husband carries a gun on his hip -- he 's the sheriff of Rock Island County . All my sons own guns . I own a gun . But we 've got to be reasonable about this , '  she said to me .  I say , ' All I want to do is make sure people who are deranged or on a terrorist watch list do n't have guns . ' That 's how I talk about it .  <p> And abortion ? <p>  I do n't try to change their mind ,  she said .  I 'm Catholic , so I understand their views . I 'm pro-choice , but  -- here she shifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with others --  that 's not what most people are talking about . Most people are talking about jobs .  <p> She talks , in other words , about these kinds of things by not talking about them much , because the people she represents , she says , are n't talking about them much , either , or do n't want to . <p> Bustos has said to me several times that she considers members of Congress  independent practitioners ,  free in their districts to do what they think is best for themselves and their constituents . But the flexibility intrinsic in this approach butts up before long against the heightened rigidity of the expectations of the party nationally . Witness the recent occurrence of Perez , the DNC chair , endorsing a pro-life mayoral candidate in Omaha , Nebraska , only to backtrack after blowback from pro-choice advocates . Bustos , though she had been tapped to help the party in spots like northwestern Illinois , was not the pick to respond to Trump after his joint session speech at the end of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Beshear handle the Democratic Party 's response -- delivered from a Lexington diner , closed , darkened and quiet but filled with citizens set up at tables as stock-still props . The content of what Beshear said hit the appropriate populist notes on health care and jobs , but it elicited mixed reviews . Johnson , for one , was baffled not only by the odd dose of stagecraft but the selection of the person to deliver the message -- an old name , not a new face . <p>  Why not Cheri Bustos ?  Johnson told me . During Beshear 's remarks , he said , he sent Bustos a text message .  I said , ' Jeez , ' you should be the one giving this response . '  <p> *** <p> Being a centrist does n't mean being an enemy collaborator . In Washington in late April , in her Capitol Hill office , Bustos smiled , drank from her Abe Lincoln mug and verbally thrashed President Trump . <p> This was three months after I had watched Bustos at the pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter that she would  give him the benefit of the doubt .  <p> A week before our meeting in Washington , though , I sat in the front row of a panel at the Institute of Politics in Chicago and listened to Bustos say people in her district who had  tried  Trump -- that 's how she phrased it -- at this point were expressing  a lot of concern .  She did n't stutter when she pronounced his first 100 days  a disaster .  <p> And the day before , in a news conference , she said the passage of the Trump-pushed health care legislation would be like  ripping out the beating heart of rural America .  <p> Now , sitting across from me in her office , Bustos practically was taunting Trump . <p>  Man ,  she said ,  if I were president of the United States in my first 100 days , I 'd want to have a lot of wins -- and , you know , I would n't want to have wins that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his multiple claims of unprecedented accomplishment in his administration 's first few months .  It 's like , ' Did you ever study history ? '  <p> But the calamity of his presidency to this point , Bustos thinks , presents an opportunity for Democrats , confident and poised to make up ground , to get to 218 in 2018 -- but particularly , she believes , if they focus on winning districts like hers . <p> Could Bustos teach Democrats how to win again ? Responding to that question of mine , she said she did n't want to sound  stuck up ,  but what she has done , she pointed out , has worked . <p> What she has done challenges the purity-test fealty that has defined this era of historic and increasing polarization in Congress . Paying attention to the messages she 's getting on the ground as much as to the talking points from above , she might say , should n't make her a traitor in the eyes of her party . To keep faith with both her constituents and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the precise stance she is taking and more a question of how she puts it . In short , her blueprint for success is simply the freedom to make a call in the field . <p>  Mine is just one way of doing things ,  she said .  I 'm not saying it 's the only way or it 's absolutely the right way . I 'm not presumptuous enough or arrogant enough to think that I have all the answers or that mine is the way to go . I 'm not saying that at all .  <p> And yet ... <p>  I 'm just saying ,  she said ,  that in a district that Donald Trump won  -- and here is the closest the classically Midwest-nice native of Illinois came to a boast --  I won by 20 points .  <p> The competitive college team MVP in Congress , one of the star players and power hitters in the annual Congressional Women 's Softball Game , wants to help her side . <p>  That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what 's worked for us , and maybe it will work for you , and here 's how you can execute .  <p> She looked at me -- really , though , she was looking at , and speaking to , the whole Democratic Party .

18399583," Mothers of the World , Unite ! <h> Email this article to a friend <p> A politics of motherhood that demands society puts a value on mothers and mothering is a politics that repudiates the patriarchal idea that women fill a  natural  role in society . <p> Motherhood has been everywhere in the political discourse of the past year , sneaking its way into the mainstream under cover of louder and flashier debates . It was in the paid family leave policies put forward by everyone from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton to ( for some reason ) Ivanka Trump . It was in the newfound awareness of child care as a national crisis , and Clinton 's own ambitious proposals on that front . Motherhood framed the way we talked about other crucial issues , from Black Lives Matter to the minimum wage . Most recently , Trump 's nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary received overwhelming blowback from constituents and politicians alike , precisely because her anti-public-school policies financially hurt parents and endanger their children . Again and again , motherhood has been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , situating abstract economic issues in the specificity of real human lives . We can not evade motherhood politics . But this time , just maybe , we might get them right . <p> Strange as it may seem , it 's feminists who are most often adverse to motherhood as an organizing cry . That objection is rooted in a long history : The conservative ideal of the sweet , self-sacrificing , married , stay-at-home mom has been used to beat half to death any woman who fails to resemble her . Women still have to fight for the dignity and value of not mothering -- thus our focus on birth control access , or abortion , or choosing to be childfree . <p> Meanwhile , the same folks telling us to stay at home routinely demonize non-white mothers with invocations of  welfare queens  and  anchor babies .  And let 's not forget the alt-Right 's fixation on  white genocide ,  raising the specter of non-white reproduction in the hopes of inciting demographic panic . <p> Even when motherhood is used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the famous Mother 's Day proclamation : the 1870 anti-war manifesto that spawned a Hallmark holiday and even now informs the idea of mothers as a political class .  Our sons shall not be taken from us ,  Julia Ward Howe wrote .  We , the women of one country , will be too tender of those of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs .  Howe used mothers ' superior  tenderness  to argue for giving them real power , calling for  a general congress of women  to achieve  the amicable settlement of international questions .  <p> To be sure , going from  mothers are inherently nice  to  the U.N. , but with chicks  within four paragraphs is a spectacularly ballsy move . But Howe 's portrait of pacifist motherhood was not much different from the  Angel in the House  ideal of her age : Mothers were a civilizing force , inherently kinder and more pious than men , and their primary purpose in life was to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motherhood , of course , applied exclusively to white women . Howe was writing five years after the Civil War ; black women 's motherhood , under slavery and after it , was treated with contempt . <p> Fast forward to today : Consider how left-wing populists ( even the otherwise great Elizabeth Warren , in her book The Two-Income Trap ) can slip into fetishizing the single-income , Father Knows Best family -- which feminists fought tooth and nail to dismantle . Consider how even  progressive  women-led groups , like Code Pink , can slip into Howe 's trap of fetishizing mothers ' selfless devotion to their children , rather than advocating for the mothers themselves . Consider -- if you can stand it -- the poreless , femvertised motherhood politics of Ivanka Trump and/or her Instagram . <p> But motherhood need not be the province of conservatives , nor sentimentalized by well-meaning sexism on the Left . Though motherhood as a symbol is often anti-feminist , motherhood as a reality can be exceptionally fruitful feminist ground . <p> One might think that there 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more general politics of feminism or parenthood . But much of the discrimination we associate with being a woman in the workforce is , in fact , specific to being a mother . According to Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner of MomsRising , an economic-justice coalition for mothers and children ,  being a mom is now a higher predictor of wage discrimination than being a woman .  It 's well known that women make approximately 78 cents to a man 's dollar ; what 's less well covered is that this is an average . In reality , women who are n't parents make 96 cents to a man 's dollar . Mothers make 76 . <p> Mothers are also less likely to be hired or promoted than women without children , and they 're uniquely vulnerable to pregnancy discrimination . Most importantly , none of this happens to fathers , except those men who take the  motherly  step of requesting part-time work in order to care for children . In fact , the motherhood penalty opens up some of the most important truths about womanhood and work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive -- something they ca n't help doing , and therefore , something they do n't need to be compensated for . The emotional labor of keeping relationships or communities together , the domestic and care work of parenting -- all of this is supposedly what a woman needs to be  happy ,  not a learned skill . Yet this free work is necessary to keep society functional , and rather than taking to it instinctively , women have to be shamed and strong-armed into doing it . We would n't be reading 75,000 opeds about how selfish working mothers are if women 's  natural  inclination was to abandon all hope of public life the moment sperm hit egg . <p> A politics of motherhood that demands society puts a value on mothers and mothering is a politics that repudiates the patriarchal idea that women fill a  natural  role in society . Such a movement , then , treats mothering as work -- domestic and emotional labor that comes with a set of objective , pragmatic needs that can be addressed with practical solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frames its demands around their needs . It is not easy to keep a being alive when it has no language , no means of selfdefense and a tendency to put everything it can see directly into its mouth . The organizational and interpersonal skill necessary to manage another person 's schedule , emotional life and survival needs , often with little to no sleep or self-care time of your own , is not a valueless resource . Motherhood may be pleasurable -- many kinds of work can be -- but it can not be done well at all unless mothers themselves have social and practical support . <p> The history of feminism practically overflows with this sort of thinking : Dorothy Dinnerstein , Audre Lorde , Adrienne Rich , Silvia Federici , Barbara Ehrenreich , even Betty Friedan all poured ink and sweat into the topic . We 're not bringing motherhood into the political discourse -- we 're bringing it back . <p> Take Federici 's fight for wages for housework (  every miscarriage is a work accident  ) , or the second-wave feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child Development Act . NOW , considered hopelessly mainstream today , made the now-unthinkable argument that child care should not only be free , but available 24 hours a day . <p> The approach has also been led by the women of color who guide the movement for reproductive justice , which posits abortion as only one of many necessities in reproductive and sexual autonomy ; women must not only be able to choose when they get pregnant , but every mother must be empowered to , as per the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective ,  parent the children she already has with the necessary social supports in safe environments and healthy communities , and without fear of violence from individuals or the government .  Like all good intersectional politics , this draws issues together into new and relevant constellations : Domestic violence and state violence are both reproductive-justice issues , as are abortion and child care , gun control and criminal justice reform , education and environmental pollution . It places the responsibility for child safety firmly in the public sphere . Rather than endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time something goes wrong , it asks how the system has been built to fail children and mothers alike , and how it might be rebuilt to help them better succeed . <p> Forging any kind of utopian , or even optimistic , vision in the Trump era is hard . It 's harder when dealing with a split and wounded Left , where the false dichotomy between  identity politics  and class politics is frequently used to kick anyone one does n't like off of Progressive Island . Yet if there is a way forward , motherhood politics is key : a substantive economic theory of labor , deeply rooted in a specific identity and the lived experience of oppression . <p> Motherhood politics is not only essential to a full understanding of labor -- its position at the intersection of identity and work makes it a place where important questions can be asked and answered . It transforms the domestic , traditionally trivialized and pushed aside as mere  women 's stuff ,  into the central ground where policy is felt and forged .

18402199," The pundits , especially Tucker Carlson , seemed mighty certain that the young immigrants were guilty of rape . <p> After all , the Montgomery County police chief had assured them in mid-March that  we have a strong case  when his investigators had accused two young men -- Henry Sanchez Milian , 18 , and Jose Montano , 17 -- of raping a 14-year-old classmate in a bathroom stall at Rockville High School . Since Sanchez Milian was an undocumented immigrant who faced a deportation hearing , it was all the right-wing media needed to know to proclaim the case the latest incident connecting immigrants to crime . <p>  We only knew they were violent criminals after they had raped a ninth-grader ,  Carlson told a Baltimore city councilman . <p> City officials  do n't want to think about the connection illegal immigration might have to this crime or others like it ,  Carlson claimed . <p> Inviting on the defense attorney hired to represent one of the boys , Carlson badgered him about the claim that the event was consensual .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be impugning the character of a 14-year-old girl who says she was raped -- other people said they heard her screams ,  he lectured . <p> Carlson 's conclusion about what the case meant :  This is insanity , of course , a sign of a sick civilization at war with itself . A strong country enforces its laws and protects its citizens . That 's Job One . In the U.S. , too often we ignore our own laws and allow ruin to be visited on our own people .  <p> He was hardly alone . Other right-wing media piled on as well : Breitbart News trumpeted the case , as did Fox News generally . David Horowitz 's FrontPage website played the story prominently , and extremist Sheriff David Clarke got to call the men  subhuman scum  on Sean Hannity 's program . Even White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke about it at length during a regular briefing . <p>  The facts of this case do not support the original charges filed ,  said Montgomery County State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the claims by defense attorneys that text messages and surveillance videos contradicted the girl 's charges apparently proved correct . The victim claimed that on March 16 , she had been pushed from a hallway into a bathroom at Rockville High and that the two suspects assaulted her in turns . <p> Of course , the charges were n't the only thing that evaporated with the story . So did all the hyperbolic claims about illegal immigration bringing horrific crime that the story supposedly represented . <p> At Horowitz 's Front Page , it became fodder for an attack on liberals :  Maryland is moving forward with ' sanctuary state ' legislation shielding illegal aliens even after the rape of a 14-year-old girl by two illegals in a Maryland high school bathroom during school hours last week outraged state residents from Hagerstown to Ocean City ,  the site reported . <p> Carlson -- who , unsurprisingly , has become a fan favorite of the white-nationalist crowd , considering his evident eagerness to provide them fodder for their hate narratives -- led the charge on the story at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing cable network . <p> One Fox broadcast featured a local Rockville High parent , Kimberly Allman , praising Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan for using the word  illegal immigrant  when speaking to them , and suggesting that if  illegal  students were removed , the district would have more money to spend . Host Martha MacCallum concluded the interview :  You know , you talk about safe spaces in education , ah , it seems the very most basic element of a safe space would be for a 14-year-old to be able to go to school and not get raped in the bathroom .  <p> Sean Hannity hosted extremist Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke , who did n't hesitate to condemn the immigrants .  I heard about that rape case , these subhuman creeps -- the thing that really angered me is that one of those guys was out awaiting a deportation hearing . That 's these anti-detainer policies ,  Clarke said . <p>  These things are killing communities , they 're killing cities , they 're obviously becoming a haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued .  This is going to come to an end . I thank God every day since the November election that Donald Trump is the president of the United States . We are going to get our arms around this thing .  <p> Rush Limbaugh declared the young men 's guilt on his radio show , and then used the case to attack  sanctuary cities  : <p> In Maryland ... This is unbelievable . In Maryland , we have the rape of a Rockville High School student by two undocumented immigrants , and now the State of Maryland is taking a vote on whether they should become a sanctuary state ! It defies ... We 're gon na take a vote on how we are openly going to break and flout the law , and again this is because of Trump , because Trump is making everybody scared . Everybody 's afraid they 're gon na be deported . We need to provide a safe haven for anybody who 's afraid of Donald Trump . <p> The story was picked up and promoted at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily briefing about the case .  The idea that this occurred is shocking , disturbing , horrific ,  he responded .  Part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this . . ? . ? . Immigration pays its toll on our people if it 's not done legally , and this is another example ,  Spicer said . <p> The Trump administration has been promoting , in line with Donald Trump 's campaign rhetoric connecting immigration to crime , a weekly bulletin from Immigration and Customs Enforcement intended to shame  sanctuary cities  by calling out immigrant-related crime within their precincts . The initial report listed 206 declined  detainers  : immigrants marked by ICE for possible deportation but who instead were released by law enforcement . More than half the cases listed by ICE , however , involved people who have only been charged with violations but have not been convicted . Out of those 206 on the list , 116 cases involve pending charges . The detainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total 3,083 detainers issued throughout the country during that same period . <p> Even after the charges in Maryland were dismissed , right-wing pundits defended taking up the story as a cause celebre . Ann Coulter penned a syndicated column ( which appeared in the white-nationalist American Renaissance ) built around a wholesale swallowing of the victim 's story . <p>  There 's also the fact that she 's 14 years old ! Her alleged rapists are 17 and 18 . Under about 700 years of Anglo-Saxon law , that 's statutory rape . ( Statute of Westminster of 1275 . ) Apparently , diversity -- in addition to being a  strength  -- requires us to jettison our statutory rape laws ,  she wrote . <p> CNN 's Brian Stelter offered a scathing assessment of the right-wing media 's behavior in the case :  Too much of the coverage omitted the conservative media 's role in making it a national story ,  he said , mentioning the White House press briefing where  Sean Spicer talked at length about how disgusting the crime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  <p> But there was another story with Maryland ties that got little to no coverage anywhere on Fox or other channels . This is a story that crossed state lines from Maryland to New York . You may not have heard about it . This was about an army veteran , an alleged white supremacist , who drove to New York and attacked a 66-year-old black man with a 26-inch knife , killing that man . Now , there is much still to be learned about this story . You can you see surveillance footage from the incident here . But , this story received almost no coverage on Fox or CNN or anywhere else for that matter . Another example of a crime , but not a crime that fit the political agenda of those pro-Trump hosts on Fox . 
@@18402203 <h> A critical look at the future of health care <p> As a Montana born citizen , now retired with past careers in both construction and state and local government , we urge all Montanans to take a critical look at the future of health care for yourself , your family and friends , and all those who make up the Montana community where we live . <p> Recently the U.S. House of Representatives passed what they termed the repeal and replace solution to the Affordable Care Act ( ACA or Obamacare ) , known as the American Health Care Act ( AHCA or Trumpcare ) . The question I urge all Montanans to consider is if you , your immediate family , and your community , would be better off if this were passed by the Senate and signed by the President ? With what we know now here are the losers in the Trumpcare scenario -- women , senior citizens who will incur high-risk premiums , those living close to or under the poverty line , the mentally ill and all those with numerous other pre-existing conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Republican tax reform is passed , will achieve tax breaks . That along with healthy upper middle class families , employers who do n't wish to provide health insurance , and young healthy individuals who do n't prioritize health care . It is true that the  winners  may achieve some decrease in policy costs initially , and no longer be required to actually carry any health insurance at all if they so choose . So what is the problem with that ? <p> First , nobody seems to be addressing the problem of what happens to those who will no longer choose or can afford to carry health insurance when they get sick . That impacts all of us who presently do have health insurance . To reinforce that point to all , YOU ARE ONLY HEALTHY UNTIL YOU GET SICK . Because of the Hippocratic Oath , doctors and hospitals must treat those unfortunate people even though they have no insurance plans to cover the cost . With no alternatives such as Medicaid to augment the costs of the uninsured , health care in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to cover the costs of the uninsured that simply do n't have the assets to pay the full cost . Ultimately all people of this state and this nation will pay the cost of the uninsured no matter what the politicians say , whether in taxes or higher health care costs . You may get a small policy deduction , but you will end up paying for it in higher health care costs . There are no free lunches in the health care industry . <p> Second , for those buying into the Trumpcare solution , I 'd like to ask you a few questions . What if you have a child with leukemia , heart disease or epilepsy ? If you have a job with existing insurance you may be fine , but if you change employment , pre-existing conditions set in and your child will not be covered . What if you are a woman needing breast cancer screening , pap smears and other reproductive health services ? Those are also considered pre-existing conditions just because you are a woman ( not to mention that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer exist ) . What if you are mentally ill ? Trumpcare will essentially deny access the mentally ill so desperately require to function in our society and suicide rates in Montana may climb even higher than they already are . Pregnancy ? For young couples it means you better not choose to change jobs if you are pregnant -- pre-existing conditions kick in and you will be footing your own maternity costs . Are you retired or close to retirement ? My wife and I are presently under a Montana Medicare Advantage Plan . However , if we should decide to move out of state and have to change insurance policies , my wife 's glaucoma or my arthritis , considered pre-existing conditions , would no longer be covered . Again , insurance companies can lower deductions when they do n't cover much of anything but that does n't mean we will ultimately save money . <p> Some have estimated that out of pocket maternity costs will rise 300 to 400 percent for those having children under Trumpcare . Consider what that might do to the abortion rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting the majority party ; well Trumpcare certainly is n't Christian . Jesus did not favor the wealthy over the downtrodden , men over women or the healthy over the sick . <p> So what can you do ? Certainly all us  losers ,  as well as those with any compassion for the less fortunate , should be calling Senator Daines immediately , asking for him to work on a Senate bipartisan fix to the current ACA that works for all Montana 's citizens . However , we can also exchange this type of short-sighted political gamesmanship with Montana-type thinking in the upcoming election . We could elect another Trump/Pence indebted , Bozeman based multi-millionaire , who will carry an agenda that does not represent core Montana health care needs . Gianforte 's favorable opinion of Trumpcare is out in the open , caught on tape and his untruths of wanting further review of the language are not believable . Or we can elect one of our own , Rob Quist , who well understands how health care costs can impact a Montana family 's ability to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox <p> HelenaIR.com Daily Headlines <p> Obituaries <p> I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy . <h> Watch this discussion.Stop watching this discussion . <h> ( 7 ) comments <p> Probably the most important sentence in this entire article is this .  We are all healthy until we get sick .  <p> Young people , especially , need to heed this warning , because it is likely that someday they will get sick , perhaps with a costly and catastrophic illness . At one time insurance was once all about sharing the risk . Now it is about maximizing profits . <p> There is no better way to share the risks than to have EVERYONE in the insurance pool . That means young , old , healthy or sick , rich or poor , all sharing the risks , because remember-----  We are all healthy until we get sick .  <p> I know I must sound like a broken record , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks------ and , single payer health INSURANCE ( which is NOT socialized medicine ) has been proven in other developed countries to save massive amounts of money while providing good health care for all . <p> To those who say Medicare provides inferior health care I say baloney . I have Medicare and it is as good as , or better than , any employer-paid health insurance I have ever had during my lifetime . <p> We should not let health insurance lobbyist propaganda deter us from carefully considering the benefits of Medicare-For-All , a system endorsed by over 20,000 American doctors who are part of Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) . Check it out . <p> Yes , ignore the fact that Obamacare is going under . Aetna lost hundreds of millions and is dropping out . Soon with liberal foot dragging you will have nothing .

Even in the CBO report of TRump-scare - that horrible plan you 'll and they 'll support even if it kills you - the CBO noted the health and superiority of the ACA system over norms and trumpscare . Handsdown . <p> I know you do n't care about accuracy or truth John , but others do . This has been debunked roundly at every turn . http : **40;605;TOOLONG ... This is the right just hoping if they 'll claim it 's a disaster that parrots like you will believe it .

They tried to use the marketplace as a political tool to gain leverage to reverse the ruling . Again ... a smart man can look these things up ... and a fake news man can just repeat fibs . <p> The right 's had 9 years to replace their old plan from the 1990 's when they first attacked Hillary for somehow suggesting health care reform ... and you still have n't found a thing that works ... but that wo n't stop the right from passing legislation that hurts 24 million americans , and costs trillions more for there rest , just to give a fat trillion in tax breaks to GG and the Trumps of the world .

The young healthy people are not signing up even with the government mandate and penalties . And they are the ones the government wants to steal from to pay for the ACA . <p> As to socialized health care listen to a Canadian who had to live under it.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=q2jijuj1ys ... And why do n't you let all of us know how well healthcare is working in Venezuela . <p> So the president 's alt-racist advisor 's paper prints fake news to make the rubes angry and complacent all at the same time - and you cite that for your source John ? This is exactly why you NEVER win and argument here . Fake newser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no credibility ... makes one wonder what our education system has wrought . <p> Let 's try some facts :  Judge John D. Bates ruled Aetna made its decision to threaten to pull out of ACA entirely at least partially in response to a federal antitrust lawsuit blocking its proposed $34-billion merger with Humana . Aetna threatened federal officials with the pullout before the lawsuit was filed , and followed through on its threat once it was filed . .... Aetna executives had moved heaven and earth to conceal their decision-making process from the court , in part by discussing the matter on the phone rather than in emails , and by shielding what did get put in writing with the cloak of attorney-client privilege , a practice Bates found came close to  malfeasance .  <p> And Blue Cross Blue shield raised their premiums ... oh no , that 's never happened before has it John . In fact Blue Cross BS lawyers raises it 's rates . They once raised mine 75% for no apparent reason before ACA . Of Course , BCBS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Montana ... both Pacific Source and The MT health coop offered much more reasonable plans ... that 's why the ACA also works choice . Before ACA you had two choices only ... under act first year 3 , next year 4 , last year you had 5 and this year you have 3 and they offer different levels of plans and coverage - not the BCBS old take it or leave policies . <p> And even better - the State editor directly reviewed BCBS shields initial requests and declare that they were grossly higher than necessary . But because the republican legislature directly disallowed the Auditor from making them adjust it - she could only comment on the largess . <p> You are lying about the number of people signing up too . Those paying the small tax penalties was again 20% fewer this year than last year with an avg payment of 330 dollars total between the 4 million households paying it . And let 's remember that 's half of what it was two year before ... and of course that 's because of more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake new again . <p> And the numbers show that the increases in the last year still put the overall costs lower than they 'd have been if there 'd been no ACA . For two reasons overall , costs are rising slower because of the cutting of costs and more coverage leading to less write-offs . During the current course of ACA costs are rising still half as fast as pre-aca . <p> Gee one Canadian does n't like their health care ? Well it 's cheaper and much higher rated than ours . I can find millions of Americans who feel the exact same way about this system and your emperor 's new trump-scare . And you show your ignorance on the subject when you bring up Venezuela ? The only person pretending that 's our health care system is you just so you can straw man it . We 'd have a nice system like England - the highest rated in the world .

There 's no verification .  <p> Andrew Young first learned about Bryan while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky University . He said the legends about Bryan are a way to cope with the gruesome details of her death . <p>  I think we have a tendency to almost fictionalize victims ,  said Young .  It 's a little too hard to really think that 's a real person . I think we do make a spectacle out of it .  <p> Young 's fascination with Bryan 's story led him to write a book titled  Unwanted : A Murder Mystery in the Gilded Age .  <p>  You do n't get a feel for the victim because she did n't write anything down or say anything to anybody ,  said Young . <p> Though the details of Bryan 's short life are few , they provide some insight as to who this young woman was : a cattle rancher 's daughter from Greencastle , Indiana , the home of DePauw University . <p> The small display on Bryan 's murder in the Campbell County Historical and Genealogical Society includes the valise that purportedly carried her head . Allison Cohen WCPO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby of the family ,  said Young .

She felt she had no choice . She was looking down the barrel of a gun . I bet she was probably scared to death .  <p> So in January 1896 , Bryan told her family she would be visiting friends in Indianapolis . In reality , she was meeting up with Jackson in Cincinnati for what she thought would be a secret abortion . <p> This sketch depicts what the young Bryan might have looked like .

@@18420634 <p> Here are some of the best responses by special contributor Kristi Scales from her recent live chats on SportsDayDFW : <p> Now that the draft is over , what position battles are you most looking forward to in OTAs/training camp/etc. ? <p> Scales : Which of the newly drafted CBs might take a starting spot from Orlando Scandrick , Anthony Brown , and Nolan Carroll ? In my opinion , there are three starting CBs because the nickel is used more than the base defensive package . Will Auzie make enough of a mark in the offseason and training camp to move into the starting lineup ? How will defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli and DBs coach Joe Baker utilize the young guys , in particular , which will challenge for playing time in the slot ? <p> Two undrafted free agents who signed with the Cowboys that are worth monitoring <p> As for returning veterans , will Chaz Green be able to grab hold of the starting RT spot in place of the retired Doug Free , or will Byron Bell make it a competition with Green ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle in at RDE , or will they move him around the line . They like his versatility , but will they want him to focus more on one spot ? And if he stays on the right side , what about DeMarcus Lawrence ? Will he go to LDE ? If he does , will Tyrone Crawford get work again inside at DT ? <p> Lucky Whitehead should not rest easy , not with the selection of a Ryan Switzer in the 4th round ( he was a dynamic punt returner in college ) . <p> So many questions , so few training camp practices . <p> Would you have liked to see the Cowboys take a risk on Jake Butt ? <p> Scales : Jake Butt is an intriguing talent who obviously would have gone much higher if not for the injury in the bowl game , but ( pardon the pun ) should the Cowboys have taken Butt in the 3rd or 4th round when the players the Cowboys selected in those rounds ( CB Jourdan Lewis , WR Ryan Switzer ) have a chance to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusher , was the priority for the Cowboys , and they covered those positions with their first three picks . As for 4th round , Switzer has a chance to upgrade the return game immediately ... plus if he 's really Cole Beasley 2.0 , it 's hard to argue with that . So while I would have loved to see Jake Butt as a member of the Cowboys and the potential successor to Jason Witten , I completely understand why the Cowboys selected the players they did in Rounds 1 through 4 . Butt went in the 5th round to the Broncos . The Cowboys did not have a 5th round pick , but it would n't have mattered . The Broncos moved to the top of the 5th round to nab him . <p> Scales : The Cowboys have an excellent track record with undrafted rookie free agents , from Dave Edwards to Cliff Harris to Drew Pearson to Everson Walls to Bill Bates to Mark Tuinei . More recently , it 's the likes of Tony Romo and Miles Austin and Barry Church . Who will emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undrafted player 's chances are tied in with position need . And since there are only two veteran QBs on the current roster , I 'm really anxious to see if a rookie like Cooper Rush can step up and take advantage of this opportunity . Cooper Rush and Austin Appleby ( University of Florida ) both have golden opportunities over the next month to shine in Rookie Camp and OTAs . If either of these undrafted QBs can make a positive impression the way Romo did in 2003 , they may convince the Cowboys there 's no need to bring in a vagabond veteran QB to add depth to the position . <p> Rush started all four years at Central Michigan in a pro-style offense , and the scouting reports raved about his maturity and leadership . He 's one of the guys I look forward to visiting with during rookie camp this weekend . <p> What are your thoughts on the Cowboys selecting Jourdan Lewis with his on-going domestic violence case ? <p> Scales : Jourdan Lewis has a chance to turn a negative into a positive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greg Hardy playbook -- take the page , and burn it . I am not putting Lewis is the same category as Hardy . But he can learn from Hardy 's mistakes in regards to the way Hardy handled his situation in Dallas . <p> Lewis can come to Dallas , acknowledge his issues ( which he did during a conference call with media immediately after his selection in the 3rd round ) and pledge to work with local charities and groups that address the issue of domestic violence . Lewis has a chance to use his platform as a member of America 's Team to tackle the issue head-on and be a resource for good . If I were his agent or adviser , I would encourage him to work with the Cowboys ' community relations department to get out-front of the issue . <p> Will Rico Gathers be a guy that cracks the 46-man game roster ? <p> Here 's what it 'll take for Rico Gathers to make the 46-man gameday roster <p> Scales : Here 's the way Rico Gathers cracks the 46-man gameday roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 53-man roster , the best way to ensure he 's active on game day is to play special teams . If Jason Witten remains healthy in 2017 , Gathers will be competing for backups snap with James Hanna and Geoff Swaim , both of whom are returning from injury . Hanna was on PUP all of last season . <p> Here 's what I 'll be watching regarding Gathers in preseason games : how many opportunities will he get on special teams ? If the coaches have Gathers involved on multiple units ( including coverage units ) , then they are giving him an opportunity to show that he can be useful on teams . The tight ends on the Cowboys ' roster than are not named Jason Witten MUST , MUST , MUST contribute on special teams . <p> Last season , Gavin Escobar played 159 special teams snaps ; that 's almost as many snaps as he had on offense ( 170 ) . Geoff Swaim got 47 snaps on special teams before he was sidelined by an injury in the game at Pittsburgh . James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-leading tackler on special teams in 2014 ( 12 tackles , a career-high ) . <p> If Gathers can prove to special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia that he can contribute on special teams , that 's Gathers ' best bet for being suited-up on Sunday afternoon rather than wearing street clothes and watching the game from the sideline . <p> Scales : Jerry did the right thing to publicly support Randy Gregory on draft weekend , especially when  reports  of another failed drug test were still that --  reports  . Jerry and the Cowboys , to my knowledge , did not have confirmation of the reports . What else was Jerry was supposed to do ? He needed to remain consistent in his message . <p> Gregory has a serious problem , one that is costing him a career . Jerry Jones has already publicly questioned the future of the league 's stance on marijuana . But in addition to that overarching question , the league should re-assess the way it deals with players who , like Gregory , already have multiple strikes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the team -- and within the support structure provided by a team-setting -- Gregory has not been allowed to go to The Star of visit with staff/coaches . When a guy like Gregory needs the most help , a team can not give it . <p> What are your expectations from Charles Tapper this season ? <p> Kristi Scales : My expectation is for Charles Tapper to work his way into Rod Marinelli 's rotation of defensive ends and serve as backup to starters like DeMarcus Lawrence and Tyrone Crawford ( if Crawford remains at end , not moving back inside to tackle ) . As to where he will be on the depth chart along with Benson Mayowa and David Irving , that remains to be seen . But the departure of Jack Crawford to the Falcons via free agency opens up a spot for Tapper . And we still do n't know what reinforcements are arriving via the upcoming draft as well as veteran/rookie free agents . <p> But let 's be realistic with Tapper , just like we must be realistic with linebacker Jaylon Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to work with teammates on the practice field part of last season and camp . Smith did n't even get to do that . <p> Scales : NFL must do better job giving players like Randy Gregory access to team support system <p> What 's your favorite DeMarcus Ware off-the-field memory ? <p> Scales : Of all the players I 've met in covering the team for the past 26 seasons , the on-field DeMarcus Ware compared to the off-field DeMarcus Ware is the textbook definition of  dichotomy  ( mutually exclusive ; opposite , contradictory ) . DeMarcus was fierce on the field , but off the field he was ( is ) a true gentle man ( two words ) . <p> Where the coaches decide to line up Tapper during OTAs and camp will be interesting -- will they let him work both sides , or try to keep him on just one side ? That 's one of the mini-subplots of camp : how Tapper and other young DL are used in the rotation . Marinelli values position-flex . <p> My favorite off-field story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taniqua adopted a baby girl . DeMarcus and Taniqua had already gone through multiple difficult pregnancies , including the birth of a stillborn son . Then in 2008 they adopted a baby girl and named her Marley ( yes , after DeMarcus ' favorite singer : reggae legend Bob Marley ) . Several times at events away from Valley Ranch , I saw the couple with their baby girl . There was big , fierce DeMarcus ... holding a tiny infant and making baby noises . <p> Being a father is special for all men , of course . But seeing DeMarcus as a doting parent seemed more poignant because of what he and Taniqua had already been through . A few years late , Taniqua gave birth to a son , DeMarcus Jr . <p> DeMarcus Sr. talked about his children during his retirement press conference on Monday . Even though it would have been great to see him play another season with the Cowboys , on a personal level I 'm glad to see him ride into the sunset happy and healthy -- and able to play with his children .

@@18421221 <p> The Washington Post reported that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is praising the move of an arrested reporter this week . The arrest of the reporter is a move that has many , including the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , decrying both the actions of Tom Price and the Capitol Police . This arrest occurred at the same time that Tom Price himself is the subject of Congressional ethics complaints over actions far more egregious than the misdemeanor the reporter has been charged with . <p> The Washington Post detailed the incident of the arrested reporter who was arrested for asking Tom Price a question . The incident occurred in the State Capitol in Charleston on Tuesday of this past week . The journalist , Dan Heyman with the Public News Service , was asking Tom Price questions about pre-existing conditions in the new Trump Care legislation related to domestic violence . <p> Tom Price would not answer the questions . Heyman asked ,  You refuse to answer ? Tell me no comment .  Moments later Heyman was pulled aside by West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol Police . He was then arrested and charged with willful disruption of state government processes , which is a misdemeanor . <p> The complaint alleges he was  aggressively breaching  security detail of the Secret Service with Tom Price and Kellyanne Conway . The Capitol Police say the charges are not related to the notion that Heyman was just asking a question , but related to physical actions they allege that he undertook at the time in question . <p> Image by John Raby/AP Images <p> The Capitol Police allege that Heyman was trying to breach the Secret Security detail , and agents were forced to remove him . But Heyman said he was not even given a warning , or given the opportunity to leave or back away . <p> Heyman told CNN after the incident that ,  It 's fair for a member of the cabinet to have security . It 's not fair for that security to protect them from uncomfortable questions .  <p> The complaint against Dan Heyman also specifically addresses  yelling questions  at Kellyanne Conway and Tom Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ,  I 've never had a client get arrested for talking too loud or anything similar to that .  <p>  He was n't doing anything different than what happens every day around the country , which is a reporter trying to get a question answered .  <p> Jamie Lynn Crofts for the ACLU in West Virginia has asked the Capitol Police to drop the charges . <p>  They have shown us every day since Donald Trump took office they do n't care about the First Amendment or the free press . Today was just another example of that . It 's horrifying .  <p> A spokesman for the Capitol Police has denied that Heyman was arrested for exercising his First Amendment rights . But Tom Price noted the arrested reporter was  not in a press conference  suggesting that reporters are only allowed to ask questions in a press conference . <p> There is no law stating that reporters are not permitted to ask questions outside of a press briefing , conference , or scheduled press scrum . The First Amendment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .  <p> As a member of a presidential cabinet , Tom Price would know this . His judgement of a member of the free press brings his own history under scrutiny . <p> The Religious News Service reported that Tom Price is an orthopedic surgeon who was a member of Congress for Georgia before joining Donald Trump 's cabinet . He was picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services with much controversy . Tom Price also identifies as a Presbyterian , and is a graduate of Emory University that is affiliated with the United Methodist Church . <p> Image by Evan Vucci/AP Images <p> Tom Price 's voting record and record on legislation reflects one aligned with the far-right Conservative ideals of the Republican party . He opposes same-sex marriage and has a record of voting to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , signing a pledge in 2008 that he would not support global warming legislation that would raise taxes . <p> CNBC News noted that Price also has a record of  potentially illegal and unconstitutional  memos , and even received a blast from Republicans the same day that Heyman was arrested . On May 3 , Tom Price issued a memo to his subordinates that prohibited them from communicating independently with Congress without first informing him . It read as follows . <p>  To ensure that our efforts are coordinated , any communications with Members of Congress and staff should not occur without prior consultation with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation ( ASL ) . This includes requests for calls , meetings , briefings , technical assistance , policy development , hearings , oversight , detailees , etc . The ASL is responsible for ensuring Secretary Price 's involvement on appropriate matters .  <p> Tom Price then received a letter on May 4 , signed by Republican Jason Chaffetz , Chairman of the House Oversight Committee , and also by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Price that his memo to his employees was  potentially illegal and unconstitutional  and seen as an attempt to stifle federal employees freedom of speech and other First Amendment freedoms . <p>  Attached is an internal memorandum we obtained from your Department . It instructs Department employees to consult with legislative affairs personnel prior to communicating with Congress . Federal employees will most certainly read this instruction as a prohibition against direct communications with Congress without permission . As such , it is potentially illegal and unconstitutional , and will likely chill protected disclosures of waste , fraud , and abuse .  <p> It 's not the only ethics problem that Tom Price has faced during his thus-far very short tenure on the Cabinet . It was very difficult for him to get on the Cabinet , after it was revealed that Tom Price had an issue with reporting stock values in an ethical manner . A USA Today analysis showed that Tom Price  often misstated the timing of stock purchases or failed to report them all together  while he was representing Georgia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosures related to his own investments in an Australian biotech company . He also reportedly invested in health care companies , and followed up those investments with legislation that would benefit the companies . It made confirmation of Tom Price into the Trump Administration very difficult , with a coalition sending letters to Senate leaders during the confirmation process asking them to delay consideration of Tom Price until all of this was sorted out . <p> During his own confirmation hearing in January , the Office of Government Ethics ( OGE ) was tweeting ubiquitous tweets as well . The tweets from the OGE said the following , while Tom Price was under testimony at his own confirmation hearing . <p> The OGE stated on their website it is the responsibility of each federal employee to understand and abide by ethics laws and rules , and that agency ethics officials are available to help in that regard . They are not a prosecuting body , but do receive complaints from the public , saying on their website it is the public 's role to assist in holding federal employees accountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day the reporter was arrested , has been the subject of OGE complaints . CBS News reported that the OGE recommended discipline of Kellyanne Conway after she promoted Ivanka Trump 's fashion line on television . Kellyanne Conway has not conducted many media interviews since that violation , after having conducted them on a daily basis . She has also been reported to the Washington D.C. Bar Association and recommended for disbarment due to her complex relationship with the truth . <p> Also , right before Tom Price 's confirmation hearing , he was the subject of an earlier Congressional ethics complaint himself . This complaint is separate from the recent May 2017 complaint alleging he was engaging in  potentially illegal and unconstitutional  acts with his own staff . <p> On January 18 , the Democratic Coalition reported Tom Price to the Office of Congressional Ethics , a different agency than the OGE , after they discovered $41,950 in petty cash withdrawals during his Congressional campaigns . The Democratic Coalition said in a press release that petty cash disbursements began June 6 , 2006 , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $100 to $750 . <p> The press release for the Democratic Coalition noted that the FEC Campaign Guide instructed that petty cash can only be used to make payments of $100 or less , and all disbursements must be tracked individually . Tom Price appears to have violated those rules . Before Tom Price was confirmed , Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition said the following in a press release . <p>  Over $40,000 in cash was withdrawn from the Congressman 's campaign account , and we have no idea where it went . This should immediately disqualify Price from being confirmed to Trump 's cabinet , and he should tell us all what that money was really spent on .  <p> The Office of Congressional Ethics ( OCE ) reviews  allegations of misconduct against members , officers , and staff of the U.S. House of representatives .  It is an office that the Republicans tried to gut once Donald Trump took office , but they were unsuccessful in that regard . According to the OCE website , in the first quarter of 2017 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is unclear if the complaint against Tom Price is one of those complaints . Today , Kellyanne Conway and Tom Price , both the subject of ethics complaints , are happy with the Capitol Police for arresting a reporter on a misdemeanor . Here is a clip of the reporter being taken away by Capitol Police . <p> Benjamin Wakana , a spokesperson for Tom Price 's predecessor , HHS Sylvia Burwell had a comment for the reporter arrested from the Tom Price complaint . He said ,  If I supported a bill that destroyed protections for people with pre-existing conditions , I probably would n't want to answer questions either . But that does n't mean you can arrest the person asking questions .  <p> The reporter arrested from the Tom Price incident is n't the only incident of prohibition of speech on the record from Tom Price . In their scathing letter to Price following his recent internal memo , Republicans Rep. Chaffetz and Rep. Grassley also said the following . <p>  Protecting whistleblowers who courageously speak out is not a partisan issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  <p> If Tom Price experiences further backlash from his prohibition of speech with federal employees , that remains to be seen .

18430181," Written by <h> Obsession <h> Share <h> Written by <h> Obsession <p> Right before her summer break in 2016 , Sophie got a stomach virus . The pint-sized 11-year-old from London took it in stride . An avid athlete and highly accomplished student , she clamored to get better for a trip her family was taking to Spain . She wanted to try surfing , go hiking , and play with her cousins . <p> Six months later , Sophie sat on a London hospital bed while its top medical team implored her to eat a spoonful of ice cream . A psychiatrist . An endocrinologist . A gastroenterologist . A pediatrician . Sophie had lost a dangerous amount of weight . The doctors told her that her brain and heart would shut down if she did not eat . She was , quite literally , starving . <p>  You could die ,  said one doctor . <p>  I do n't care ,  she responded . <p> How this 11-year-old went from a bubbly , extroverted tennis star who loved brownies and burgers to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK 's high-stakes exams ? The negative influence of social media ? The insidious images of bone-thin women and girls in fashion and advertising ? Stress over fraught friendships , or pressure from home ? <p> But for those who have seen or experienced eating disorders , Sophie 's story might sound familiar . The illness seemed to come out of nowhere ; a  demon  that took over Sophie ( not her real name ) , fueling rage and paralysis when faced with food .  I was not negotiating with the child I had known for 11 years ,  Sophie 's mother said . She found herself needing to coach Sophie through every snack and meal , and facing a never-ending list of fears , including the potential long-term damage to her daughter 's brain and reproductive organs . Then there was grief over watching her child succumb to a disease she did not even know could affect kids so young . <p>  When the doctor told us ' I 'm sorry to tell you that your daughter has pre-pubertal anorexia nervosa ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mom .  How is anorexia something that a prepubescent kid can even develop ?  <p> While the number of people who suffer from anorexia has not changed dramatically over the years , the profile of the girls who are presenting with the condition has .  The illness is starting at a younger age ,  says Mima Simic , joint head of child and adolescent eating disorder service at the Maudsley Hospital in West London , a clinic that 's responsible for changing the way eating disorders are treated around the world . <p> Lisa Damour , a clinical psychologist in the US whose book Untangled examines the inner life of teenage girls , says anorexia is among the problems that worry her most .  I would not wish this on my worst enemy ,  she said .  Eating disorders , like substance use disorders , have a powerfully addictive property . They both can take over a person 's life and spin dangerously out of control .  <h> What causes it ? <p> Anorexia has a significant genetic component : 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is genetic .  There seems to be a biological vulnerability ,  said Joanna Steinglass , an associate Professor of clinical psychiatry at the Columbia Center for Eating Disorders .  You do n't get it because of something someone says to you .  Of course , most people who are vulnerable do not develop an eating disorder . But for those who do carry the genetic vulnerability , high levels of anxiety , perfectionism and competitiveness increase the risk of developing the disorder . <p> The illness is most often triggered by dieting or some kind of restrictive eating , and/or compulsive exercising . Since younger children are now bombarded with messages about what is  good  and  bad  food , and what constitutes a  healthy  lifestyle , some start to control their food at earlier ages , triggering the illness earlier . <p>  Younger people want to become vegetarian and vegan and they select the food they want to eat -- they restrict their diet -- and that will trigger the genetic risk they might be carrying ,  says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are emphasizing healthy eating , but rather that they demonize categories of food , such as sugar and gluten . <p>  Promoting sensible , healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle is clearly a positive ,  says Ivan Eisler , the other co-head of the eating disorders unit at Maudsley , and one of the doctors who helped pioneer changes in how the illness is treated .  The risk arises if it encourages extremes and/or implies that those who do not conform to this are in some way lacking in character or weak .  <p> Rebecka Peebles , co-director of the Eating Disorder Assessment and Treatment Program at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia is emphatic on this point . While she of course supports children ( and adults ) eating a balanced diet , she says the onslaught of eating advice is hard for kids -- and parents -- to navigate .  I am concerned that all of this focus on healthy eating is harmful to some kids ,  she says . <p> Social media and selfie culture also plays a role , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant and judgmental eye on images , taken , filtered , and doctored for Snapchat , Instagram , and other platforms .  They are being bombarded ,  said Simic . Weight shaming and weight bias sends kids a message that there is only one ideal of beauty , which they might not fit . <p> Bullying may also play a role , heightening feelings of shame and inadequacy , guilt and sadness .  Anorexia and bulimia provide an escape from the emotional pain ,  wrote two family therapists from the US . <p> Once the illness is triggered , a terrifying vicious cycle emerges : Restriction leads to starvation , and not eating becomes a greater comfort than eating . Starvation impacts the brain and leads to very irrational behavior .  It hijacked our daughter 's brain ,  said Sophie 's mother . <p> And in extreme cases , anorexia can be deadly . Indeed , it has the highest morbidity rate of all child and adolescent and mental health conditions . <p>  The eating disorder is characterized by extreme fear when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musby , whose own daughter had anorexia , and who wrote a book about it .  When you are in fear , you are in fight , flight , or freeze . You lose all of your rational faculties and you will do what it takes to make yourself feel safe .  <p> Eisler explains it this way : When people who are not predisposed to an eating disorder are starving , they become irritable and edgy . Eating will calm them . Those who are predisposed to anorexia react to food deprivation differently .  Instead of feeling irritable and edgy and wanting to eat , it can be calming to someone who is predisposed ,  he says . <p> One British broadcaster recalled publicly that he did not understand why his daughter would not eat . In frustration , he told her :  If you really want to starve yourself to death , just get on with it .  He told the Guardian later that he  failed utterly to grasp that she was seriously mentally ill .  <p> In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simic are also seeing younger girls present with other mental health issues .  We are seeing more young people with a mixed picture of depression , anxiety , and self harm , as well as eating disorder symptoms ,  says Simic . <h> The many misconceptions about anorexia <p> Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental health condition but many misconceptions swirl around it . Musby lists a few : <p>  The main one , that it only affects women ,  she says . In the UK , 11% of sufferers are men , a likely very low estimate . <p>  Another easy one -- it only affects adolescents .  <p> And , she added , it 's not true that  you have to look underweight to diagnose anorexia or to have anorexia .  <p> The biggest one ?  That it is a purely psychological disorder -- that it is a choice or a coping mechanism or about some need for control over one 's life .  <p>  People to this day often have ideas that patients are seeking control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all kinds of narratives which are hard to disprove but that the data do not support ,  says Steinglass . <p> Hadley Freeman , who was anorexic and writes for the Guardian , says this is frustrating .  Eating disorders are the only mental illness that people still assume is caused by something identifiable and external ,  she wrote .  No sensible person would ask anyone why they became schizophrenic , why they suffer from clinical depression .  <p> She writes that it is frustrating to see so many people associate the syndromes with just wanting to look thin .  Can we please make the overdue distinction between women suffering from body image issues and actual eating disorders , which are a specific mental illness ?  <p> Then there are people who assume eating disorders are the result of some kind of trauma , or something serious that has happened with the family . They quietly conclude the parents are to blame . <p> Carrie Arnold , also writing in the Guardian , reflected on how much therapists wanted to assign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosed with anorexia more than 15 years ago . The reason I continued to starve myself despite my failing organs and being forced to drop out of school , the doctors said , was that something was wrong in my family . And as soon as that was sorted out , I would get well . One therapist told me my parents were too controlling . Another said that there was too much pressure on me to be perfect . Yet another suggested that I just did n't want to grow up , and my mother was afraid to let me leave the nest .  <p> The problem , she concludes , is  none of these things were true .  <p>  Sophie no more chose to get anorexia than another child chose to get leukemia or autism ,  her mother said .  This illness came out of nowhere , hijacked her brain and messed up the circuitry between her brain and her eating system .  <h> Anorexia nervosa , by the numbers <p> There are many kinds of eating disorders : anorexia nervosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss ; bulimia , which involves binging and vomiting ; Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder ( OSFED ) , which has various subtypes ; and Unspecified Feeding and Eating Disorder ( UFED ) . <p> Parsing statistics on eating disorders is tricky for a number of reasons : Many children are not diagnosed or misdiagnosed , and some do not meet the full criteria for receiving a formal diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia . The diagnostic standards have changed dramatically , and there is more familiarity with the illness . For example , it used to be that girls had to stop getting their period to be diagnosed as anorexic , which precluded anyone who had not started menstruating . Earlier criteria had strict weight guidelines and behavior requirements . <p> Rates of eating disorders vary around the world . One study that looked at the Netherlands , where all general practitioners are trained to recognize eating disorders , found a significantly higher rate , of 107 adolescent girls per 100,000 , in the late 1990s . That figure has since stabilized at 97 per 100,000 , still almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per 100,000 . Rates for women over a lifetime in the US range from 1% to 4.2% for women ; according to the National Institute of Mental Health , 2.7% of teens aged 13-18 years old struggle with an eating disorder . <p> The illness appears to be growing in children under 13 , studies and doctors say .  The data would suggest there are younger kids who are developing anorexia who were not before ,  said Eisler . <p> A UK study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry tried to assess news cases in kids under 13 ; it found that  it may be increasing in younger age groups .  <p> This presents certain challenges . Distorted body image or refusal to see the seriousness of low weight is often a symptom of anorexia nervosa , but younger kids are less likely to report these , said Peebles .  They are more likely to report tummy pains ,  she said . Younger kids decide not to eat but can not articulate why . They are more likely to exercise , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child has lost weight and exhibits anorexic tendencies -- a preoccupation with food and how to not eat it , for example -- but the child has not lost enough weight to warrant a diagnosis under the medical criteria , the child is not technically anorexic . With the changes in diagnostic criteria , Eisler thinks many people who used to receive a diagnosis of  eating disorders not otherwise specified  are now being diagnosed as anorexic . <p> Not everyone believes increased referral rates for younger children are the result of more kids developing anorexia : it may be improvements in diagnosis , similar to autism . Peebles says she sees many younger patients , but is wary of attributing that to rising rates of the illness , rather than increased awareness among pediatricians who refer patients to her . In her practice ,  8- to 12-year-old patients are not uncommon at all -- they used to be less common ,  she said .  The numbers are up , but is the incidence is truly rising ? We are not sure .  <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new way to treat anorexia at the Maudsley Hospital . One of the main changes was looking at parents as a potential resource , rather than a target for blame . Called family therapy in the UK , it focuses on keeping kids out of hospitals -- unless they were dangerously ill -- and harnessing the family as the key resource in recovery .  Our mantra is families do n't cause anorexia but families are the best resource in treatment of anorexia ,  says Simic . ( The approach is called family therapy in the UK and  family-based-therapy  or  FBT  in the US . ) <p> In family therapy , parents take charge of the eating completely until weight is normalized and healthy eating habits are rediscovered , and then control is gradually handed back to the child . <p> The challenge is that starving appears to upset the brain 's normal function .  It 's realizing that the way you think and behave comes from how your brain functions , and your brain needs nutrition ,  says Musby . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomized clinical trial published in 2010 , around half of teenagers with anorexia treated with family therapy met the criteria for full recovery after a year , compared with 23% receiving standard treatment . <p> Part of the argument for family therapy is based on research and experience showing that the best treatment is not in a hospital , where other kids which can sometimes spark competitive starving , but at home , with ample support . <p> With in-patient settings , Eisler says ,  we often see the symptoms escalate and there is copying behavior .  As the pathology gets more severe ,  they get institutionalized because it is a protected environment . Normal life becomes more distant .  For many patients , however , hospitalization is necessary and life-saving . When a child can not eat , re-feeding is essential . <p> That was the case for Sophie : After months of all-day inpatient treatment , she was finally hospitalized .  We could n't help her be safe ,  said her mother .  She needed the power of a full 24-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  <p> There are some advantages to getting the illness earlier , namely that parents can play a bigger role in supporting their child 's recovery because they are still in a pattern of feeding and caring for younger children . Teenagers seeking independence can be more resistant to control from their parents . <p> But younger children also are less likely to understand the complex emotions they are feeling around food , and when they are asked to eat it to gain weight , it can trigger raw panic .  These kids who have been incredibly gentle kids , they turn into different people when they are asked to eat and gain weight ,  said Peebles .  They become demonic . They scream and hit their parents .  <p> And Eisler says research has also identified heightened risks to children when it strikes at a younger age . For one , they do not have to lose much weight to be in danger . Prolonged starvation can affect bone density and brain function , though much of that can be restored if treatment happens sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of restoring weight with food that has been repeatedly condemned as  unhealthy .  <p>  Health promotion messages , and our society 's demonizing of certain foods and body shapes , make recovery extra difficult ,  says Musby .  For most people with an eating disorder , health means the exact opposite of the typical health promotion message . They need to eat more of all food types , they need to drop rules about ' good ' and ' bad ' foods ; many ca n't beat the illness while they exercise , and it looks like nobody truly recovers if they keep the ' skinny ' look that society idealizes .  <h> Outcomes <p> Musby wrote her book in part because she felt she had wasted precious time trying to work out how to get her child to eat . When her daughter became ill at 10 , the family struggled to figure out how best to help her . <p> The experience was terrifying .  I recall not being able to convince her that water would not make her fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of families going through the same thing and said there are some patterns : truthful children become expert liars ; throwing food and even plates can become normal as the child tries to resist food , and parents struggle to force eating when it so clearly appears to harm the child .  Some young people cry ,  Musby says .  Some get angry -- most get angry . They are in fight or flight . When they are given no choice but to eat , they will look for ways of cheating -- they put food in their pockets , drop it on the floor .  One mother said her daughter hid food in her underwear . <p> Many kids close themselves off from their friends , stop sports and extracurricular activities and some have to drop out of school . For many , the effects carry on later in life , even after normal eating habits have been restored . <p> The good news is that anorexia appearing in younger children is highly treatable .  This is one of the most rewarding conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery ,  said Simic . Between 60% and 70% of kids seen in at Maudsley are discharged after a year with no further treatment at all ( not even therapy -- a critical difference from the US , where therapy tends to be ongoing ) . About 15% will continue to need help managing anxiety and depression , and the rest facing ongoing challenges . <p> Eisler 's message to parents is simple : If you are worried that your child might be developing an eating disorder , go to a specialist immediately , he says .  Do n't wait and see where it will go .  <p> Women who are diagnosed as adults have a much tougher prognosis for recovery .  The longer you have the disorder , the harder it is to recover ,  Simic says , noting that changes in the brain may be harder to reverse ( though not impossible ) . <p> Musby has seen all sorts of outcomes .  For some it is treated and it goes , and that 's the end of it ,  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relapses and then it goes . And for some it is something they have to control all their life .  <p> Sophie was ultimately force-fed , an experience she decided she did not want to repeat . She started eating again and returned to a healthy weight . Her mother describes the experience as  hell  and worries about what adolescence will hold for her daughter . Have they survived the worst of it ? Will Sophie relapse ? Will they walk away from the illness , or forever live in its shadow ? <p> List of resources : <p> Eva Musby can be contacted here .

@@18430185 <h> Sign in <h> My Grandmother 's Desperate Choice <p> My questions about my grandmother 's death , of a self-induced abortion , have n't changed since I was twelve years old . What feels new , in the Trump era , is the urgency of her story.CreditPHOTOGRAPH COURTESY KATE DALOZ <p> As a child , I knew only that my grandmother had died when my mom was still a baby . The one time I asked what had happened to her , a bolt of panic flashed across my mother 's face .  A household accident ,  was all she said . <p> I was twelve years old when she finally told me the truth . Some friends and I had got into a long after-school discussion about abortion , prompted by the gruesome posters that a protester had staked in front of the Planned Parenthood in our Vermont town . I had already begun reading my mother 's Ms. magazines cover to cover , but this was the first time I 'd encountered a pro-life position . When I hopped into my mom 's car after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost finished repeating one friend 's pro-life argument when I saw the look on Mom 's face . That 's when she told me : the  household accident  that had killed her mother had , in fact , been a self-induced abortion . <p> Her hands were tight on the steering wheel as she spoke . I realized later that it was n't the topic of abortion itself that made her so uneasy -- she was a nurse and a Roe-era feminist who usually responded straightforwardly to even the most embarrassing health questions . Rather , her anguish arose from sharing a truth that she 'd been brought up believing was too terrible to speak . <p> Sitting beside her in the passenger seat , I struggled to absorb the meaning of what she 'd told me . I had only just grasped what abortion was a few hours earlier , and was still trying on this new pro-life idea .  O.K. ,  I said ,  but what about the uncle or aunt I never had ?  Mom whipped toward me , face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with me .  What about the mother I never had ?  she said . <p> Until recently , everything my mom knew about her mother fit into one three-ring binder . Inside were letters , documents , and photos that my mother had collected over the years . After the election last fall , as an Administration hostile to women 's reproductive rights settled into the White House , I asked her to send the binder to me , and did some sleuthing of my own . I got in touch with aging relatives and family friends , who offered crumbling bundles of my grandmother 's letters , carefully preserved for decades . My questions about her life and death had n't changed since I was twelve years old . What felt new , in the Trump era , was the urgency of her story . <p> My grandmother , Winifred Haynes Mayer , was born in New York City , in 1912 , to an upper-middle-class family . Her father , a doctor , spent time in France during the First World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. in love with a Frenchwoman and seeking a divorce . Win and her brother were raised in the Bronx by their mother , Nyesie , a nurse . <p> Nyesie was determined that her daughter receive a college education , and in 1929 Win enrolled at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . There she majored in English , helped found a literary magazine , and , in her senior year , met my grandfather , Eddie . Win was lean and athletic , with high cheekbones and windblown hair . In photographs , she always looks as though she 's just returned from a brisk stroll . <p> Win and Eddie married in 1939 . She got pregnant immediately but miscarried after her doctor prescribed some medication , possibly for morning sickness . In a short letter to her mother , dated  Thursday , I guess ,  she wrote ,  I lost the little kangaroo early Wednesday morning and am now lying in an empty and ethery tearful state of mind .  Nyesie wrote back , with some words crossed out ,  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to you .  <p> My uncle Peter was born in 1941 . (  He is a very funny looking little squirt but we like him ,  Win wrote Nyesie .  Are there any chipmunks in our family ?  ) Soon after the United States entered the Second World War , Eddie was recruited by the newly formed Office of Strategic Services , and the family moved to Alexandria , Virginia . They rented a small apartment from some friends , Katrina and Chandler Morse , whose rambling house was a gathering place for a community of O.S.S. families . <p> Sooner or later , they knew , Eddie would leave for London . But the dates and duration of his deployment kept changing , and the uncertainty began to wear on Win . With Eddie away on a three-day business trip , she noted ,  I am getting a foretaste for which I do not particularly care .  When he finally departed in April , Win was seven months pregnant with my mother , Judy . Eddie would not meet his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friend and landlady , needed the apartment for her sister-in-law and infant niece , so Win moved away , to a nondescript block of Army housing . She spent the summer of 1943 caring for her two children alone in the thick Virginia heat . Her letters to Nyesie convey a parent 's mix of joy and fatigue .  Judy is a sweet , juicy little girl as ever ,  she wrote .  She howls from 7 till 8:30 which is very dull because by then I am fed up with children and want only to sit on the front porch in the cool of the evening .  <p> Eddie 's letters indicated that he 'd likely be returning in November , but that month came and went with no sign of him . Then , just before Christmas , Win 's neighbor ran over to relay an urgent message from Katrina -- she 'd heard , through the O.S.S. grapevine , that Eddie was on a flight home . Win quickly cleaned the house , and then rushed with the children to the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. &amp; P. , they told her he was waiting at the train station .  So we all dashed in to meet him !  she wrote to her mother .  T'is wonderful to have our family whole again .  <p> It was n't to last . Eddie 's commanders had decided that his project would require him in Europe indefinitely ; once deployed , under the best scenario he 'd have short leaves every six to eight months .  I really do n't think the Lord would have had to try boils to find the limit of my endurance after that ,  Win wrote . That winter , a preoccupied tone crept into her letters to Nyesie :  I . . . heard from Beth that Winston had been killed over Munster . . . and that his widow has had twins , a boy and a girl ,  she wrote .  Birth and death follow each other so swiftly these days that one has no time for the appropriate feelings about either of them .  A few weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This pregnancy , unlike the others , is never mentioned in her surviving letters . Nyesie came to visit the first weekend in April , and it 's likely that Win asked her in person for help in obtaining an abortion . This would not have come as a shocking request . Nyesie was part of a large social circle of progressive doctors and nurses , and she would have known which of her colleagues might be willing to perform a  D. and C.  in violation of the law . In the nineteen-thirties , she had arranged an abortion for her son 's wife , an actress . The couple had gone on to have two daughters . <p> Nyesie agreed to help Win . The next weekend , Win left her children in Virginia and travelled to New York . But , at the last moment , for reasons that have been lost , the arrangements Nyesie had made fell through . Win then turned to another New York physician she hoped might be able to help -- her father . He refused . Eddie later told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this advice :  Frenchwomen take care of these things themselves .  <p> Back in Virginia the next Sunday , Win went with Eddie and the children over to Katrina 's house . The weather was cool and gray but the peach trees were in full bloom . Katrina wrote to her husband , who was stationed in London ,  The maples are covered with their funny yellow-green flowers and the grass is that beautiful soft lush spring green .  Win left no record of what she was thinking or feeling that weekend as the others tilled the garden while the children napped in a hammock . But when I imagine her these are the things I think about : of how provisional and precarious early pregnancy feels , even when welcomed with more joy than fear ; of how everything during that time narrows in toward the dark knot at your center , the turning point of your whole future ; and of desperation , the kind that manifests not in panic but in a calm practicality . Of how plain the way forward can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Tuesday , April 18 , 1944 , Eddie went to work as usual . At noon , Win gave the children lunch and put them down for their naps . Then , as though it were any other task that needed to be completed during her few hours of solitude , she went into the bathroom . The sharp object she took with her -- a knitting needle ? -- is another detail that has been lost . That evening , Katrina was coming home from the Washington Nationals ' opening day .  As I walked across the porch into the house from the game . . . the phone was ringing ,  she wrote to her husband .  It was about 6:45 . I let the phone ring while I went and let the dogs out who had been shut in our bedroom all afternoon . As I picked up the phone Eddie Mayer 's voice came to me saying , ' Katrina -- can you come right over . I think Winnie is dead . '  Eddie had arrived home from work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in her crib , crying , but two-year-old Peter had been out of bed and wandering around the apartment for hours . <p>  The true cause as stated by the autopsy is ' death due to shock as a result of an attempt to force a miscarriage by mechanical methods , '  Katrina wrote to her husband .  But the party line which we are following and telling every one is death caused by an embolism .  My mother would not learn what really happened for more than two decades . In lieu of an explanation , adults offered confusing half-truths that conveyed no clear message apart from their own guilt and shame . Once , Nyesie sat her grandchildren down in the living room to tell them the story , mixing the truth of the abortion with the lie of the embolism in a way she apparently thought that they could handle . My mom was five years old at the time . Almost seventy years later , she recalled the scene to me in detail : how she was sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backlit against the living room 's bay windows .  What I understood was that there was a baby and a bubble ,  my mom told me . Her grandmother offered no follow-up , and the children had long since learned not to ask questions . Peter , who was seven years old , decided that his mother had died of cancer . But my mother heard something different : she knew that she had been a baby when Win died . It took her decades to shake the conviction that she 'd been the cause of her mother 's death . <p>  It took all my courage and energy just to bring up the subject the few times I did ,  my mom recalled . As a junior at the University of Hawaii -- the farthest-from-home college she could find -- she wrote her father a letter , demanding at last to know the truth . It arrived the same day Eddie found out that his own mother had died .  I 'm so grateful for your having written ,  he wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a terrible brink of loneliness &amp; lack of communication &amp; hopelessly tumbling over the edge into the void .  But it was n't until he visited her a year later that she dared to bring it up again . She was the exact age that Win had been when Eddie first met her , and they bore a startling resemblance . As my mom remembers it ,  I was driving my car from the Waikiki side to the Kailua side of Oahu when I told him that I wanted to know how Win had died .  In clipped sentences , he told her the truth . She reached over to grab his hand , but he shoved it back at her . Eddie lived for another forty years , but they never spoke about Win 's death again . <p> It was in the feminist movement of the nineteen-seventies that Mom found , for the first time , other women who were determined to talk about abortion -- not in hushed tones but as a matter of health care and family planning . Three years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a few months old , she finally sent away for her mother 's death record . Under  cause of death ,  the coroner had written in a sloped hand :  Attempt at criminal abortion , self-inflicted .  The word  criminal  refused to sink in .  That night , for the first time in many years , I vomited several times ,  she told me .  Somehow I knew I was n't sick , but was having a life purge .  <p> Several months before the election , my own seven-year-old daughter asked me how her great-grandmother had died . Already , there 'd been reports of a rise in self-induced abortions in states where access had been restricted . Despite years of thinking about Win 's death and how to talk about it , I was caught off guard by her question . We were on the street . I was wrestling car keys out of my purse with one hand while trying to keep a grip on my toddler son with the other . Like my own mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story -- what had happened to her , what she had done , and why -- my daughter would need a number of moral and biological concepts that were not yet in place in her young mind .

I wanted to assure her that , even though this was a story she needed to grow into , she should always feel free to ask questions , and that I would answer as honestly as I could . And I wanted to break my family 's long-standing silence surrounding Win 's death , because silence only helps to perpetuate the fallacy that outlawing abortion has ever stopped women from attempting it . <p> If I could n't immediately explain to my daughter how Win died , I decided , I could at least explain why .  She needed help really badly and no one would help her so she died ,  I told her . Then I added a reassurance that I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a thing that would happen to us now ,  I said .

Yvanna Cancela 's SB265 , which would increase transparency from pharmaceutical companies over diabetes drug costs and mandate certain disclosures from pharmaceutical sales representatives and health care nonprofits , continues to work its way through the legislative process . The bill was heard in Senate Finance on Saturday and is scheduled for a committee vote on Monday . <p> The poll , paid for out of Cancela 's campaign account , was conducted by David Binder Research between April 17 and 20 . It sampled 505 people in both English and Spanish with a margin of error of 4.4 percent . <p> Cancela said that she felt it was important to poll the issue because the bill is  unlike anything that 's been done in recent Nevada history .  <p>  I thought it was really important to have a gauge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  Cancela said .  While it 's clear there is a problem , I was n't sure if there was public support for addressing the problem in this specific fashion , and I think the poll really shows that this is an issue people want action on .  <p> She also said she wanted to have data as a tool for her conversations with fellow lawmakers and show public support for the bill . <p>  I think that the data allows for there to be a conversation about public support and the public 's desire for change on this issue ,  Cancela said .  I think that 's a good tool with policymakers .  <p> The poll shows Nevadans tend to believe that diabetes is either a  serious problem  for the state ( 63 percent ) or a  public health crisis  ( 11 percent ) .

The vast majority of them , 65 percent , believe that pharmaceutical companies are responsible for the costs of prescription drugs , while 18 percent blame insurance companies and 8 percent blame pharmacies . <p> The Nevada data backs up a perception that exists across the country that prescription drugs are too expensive and that the pharmaceutical industry is to blame .

Pharmaceutical companies argue that middlemen in the drug pricing process known as pharmacy benefit managers ( PBMs ) and insurers negotiate heavy rebates and discounts off of the list prices of drugs and are n't passing the savings along to consumers , resulting in high drug costs . <p> The difficulty is that the only publicly and consistently available numbers on prescription drugs are the list price and the amount that someone pays at the pharmacy counter , making it difficult to tell whether it is pharmaceutical companies , PBMs or insurers who are taking the biggest slice of the pie . That 's part of what Cancela aims to address through her bill by requiring companies to disclose the costs of manufacturing drugs and the rebates they give to PBMs . <p> The poll also gauges the public 's opinion on controlling the prices of diabetes drugs , a portion of the bill that Cancela struck from her bill due to constitutional concerns raised by legislative lawyers .

@@18446358 <p> Guest columnist Terry Maxon worked as an airlines reporter in Dallas for more than two decades , covering the major carriers headquartered in North Texas . Here , he offers his take on the airline 's recent run of negative attention -- deserved and otherwise . <p> If you 're like most people , you may be wondering why the skies over America seem to have become so wild recently . The examples are easy to remember : A doctor dragged off a United Airlines flight , flight attendants wrenching a stroller away from a distraught woman with kids on an American Airlines flight ; a Delta Air Lines passenger booted for getting up during taxiing . What 's happening ? <p> First of all , there will always be an abundance of airline complaint stories if a reporter wants to chase them . The numbers dictate it . <p> In 2016 , U.S. airlines carried about 744 million passengers , or nearly 204,000 a day . If one in 100 has a gripe about something -- seat assignment , damaged bag , rude gate agent , bad checkpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more than 20,000 unhappy people a day . <p> But almost all of us have shock absorbers between our ears . We go with the flow . A late flight , a bad seat assignment , the last bag off the conveyor , someone reclining their seat in our lap -- we sigh and let it go . But they 're the ordinary unhappy customers , not the really unhappy . <p> For the sake of argument , let 's say only one one-thousandth of 1 percent ( 0.001% ) of the daily flying mob ends up truly unhappy -- they were bumped against their will , their bags were stolen , a flight attendant unloaded on them , they missed the wedding , graduation or funeral . That 's 20 people a day , 20 stories a day . And the actual number of unhappy people who have a gripe they 'd like to air is much higher , I 'm sure . <p> You can make a career out of reporting about unhappy airline customers . Even when airlines are almost perfect ( and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always some story . A video of a fight onboard a flight is newsworthy any time . Sorry . We ca n't help ourselves . <p> Most of the  bad airline  stories involve cases that started when a passenger violated some rule . <p> Second , the United Airlines incident sensitized the news media to potential stories . Without the United Airlines incident , most of the stories coming out would not have been aired or written . But so much attention was devoted to the United incident that it elevated the public 's and media 's interest in similar stories . <p> Third , and I say this without defending any airline , most of the  bad airline  stories involve cases that started when a passenger did n't obey the flight crew or otherwise violated some rule . <p> The woman who tried to keep her double stroller with her . The United passenger who refused an order to get off the airplane . The family who tried to put a car seat on a seat for another passenger who did n't take the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an ineligible passenger . The man who ignored the seat-belt light and got up to go to the bathroom during taxiing . The woman who ignored the seat-belt light and got up to go to the bathroom during descent . <p> I once had a coworker complain to me that a flight attendant made her take out her earphones during takeoff , under safety rules then in effect . The coworker was outraged that the flight attendant did n't trust her to have her music player off . I had no sympathy since someone continuing to use a music player would look exactly like someone with their music player off . <p> She informs me that the story was more complex than that . But as I saw it , it was simple -- she did n't want to do what the flight attendant told her to do . Whether the passenger is right or not , you have to do what the pilot or flight attendant tells you to do on the airplane . Now , we can argue about whether the safety rules are reasonable or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable . But those are the rules , and it 's the airline 's airplane . <p> With this spate of recent stories , we might come to the conclusion that passengers are registering ever more complaints against airlines , that complaints are soaring . Here are some facts . <p> In 2016 , airline customers lodged 10,833 complaints with the U.S. Department of Transportation . That 's 1.52 complaints per 100,000 passengers . By comparison , the year before they registered 12,771 complaints , or 1.90 per 100,000 . That 's a 20 percent drop in the rate of complaints in 2016 compared with 2015 . <p> This is encouraging , but the rate of complaints is still historically high . In 2014 the number complaints was 1.29 per 100,000 . Go back 10 years , and there were 0.87 complaints per 100,000 in 2006 . <p> Here 's something the DOT numbers do n't show : the impact of social media and , perhaps more important , the ability to take video on most cellphones . Few people know that they can complain to the DOT , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhappy Facebook comment or highly entertaining video and really get an airline 's attention . <p>  We have become a nation of outrage fueled by social media ,  says veteran airline reporter Ted Reed .  This mood elected a president . I can not quite figure out how airlines got into the middle of this .  <p> Reed , who began covering airlines some 28 years ago for the Miami Herald and now writes for TheStreet.com , agreed that  most airline passengers have a good experience . But social media became the medium of the unhappy and the outraged -- despite the opportunity it offers to ' like ' stuff . So recent airline incidents are largely a social media phenomenon with only a minimal relationship to airline customer service .  <p> Aware of this growing phenomenon , airlines keep growing their staff to counter the cyber complaining . Several years ago , Southwest Airlines showed off its social media room where a team of employees was keeping constant tabs on what their passengers were saying about them on Twitter , Facebook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked the customer . If they got a complaint , particularly about something that was happening right then , they worked to resolve the situation before it got out of hand . <p> The room was filled with video screens displaying floating tweets , comments , whatever , as the employees watched or typed away or otherwise responded to the problems that popped up many times during the day ( and night ) . <p> Southwest regularly has among the lowest rate of complaints , as measured by DOT . Last year , it received 0.47 complaints per 100,000 passengers , lowest of the major U.S. carriers . Compare that to Spirit Airlines , an ultra-low-fare carrier , which recorded 6.74 complaints per 100,000 . <p> I do n't like adding regulations , but someone has to protect the passengers from the race to the bottom in economy coach . <p> When I was a daily reporter , I received more customer complaints about Spirit than all other airlines combined . That likely was due to an interview I did with Spirit 's then chief executive officer , Ben Baldanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies . People Googled  Spirit Airlines  and found me and my email address . <p> In that interview , Baldanza said Spirit would n't be able to offer its rock-bottom fares if it did n't adhere to its business plan , which charged extra for basically everything except the seat and the seatbelt . If it waived its policies , it would n't be so inexpensive , he said . <p> I had told him about a woman who had flown on Spirit on a round-trip ticket from Minneapolis-St . Paul to Phoenix to visit relatives . Her husband called her in Phoenix to tell her that their young daughter had died suddenly of a previously undiagnosed physical problem . <p> With all the attention paid to social media videos and onboard service , is anyone noticing that the size of seats are shrinking ? <p> Wikicommons <p> She could n't get a Spirit flight back home soon enough , so she booked a ticket on another flight . She contacted me some time later because Spirit had declined to refund any money for the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very sad case indeed , but insisted that Spirit had to stick to its no-refund policy for tickets such as her 's to be able to offer its cheap fares . The woman had bought a non-refundable fare , and Spirit had non-refunded it . <p> As I remember , the complaints did n't involve situations when Spirit was breaking its rules . The passengers just did n't like them because the rules seemed so ... unfair . <p> Baldanza departed Spirit in January 2016 , and new CEO Robert Fornaro has by all accounts tried to make the airline more customer-friendly . Initial reports indicate he 's making some headway . And as bad as Spirit 's 6.74 per 100,000 rate of complaints was in 2016 , it was way less than its 11.73 per 100,000 rate in 2015 . <p> But what 's our freshest memory of Spirit Airlines ? Video of the Spirit passengers throwing punches at the Fort Lauderdale airport May 8 when Spirit had to cancel a spate of flights because of a lack of pilots . Now we have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline service gotten so bad . <p> In the constellation of airline gripes , I 'm more concerned about the tendency to reduce legroom than charge fees for bags or bump passengers from overbooked airplanes . By paying so much attention to the altercations captured on cell phones we might be missing some of the more systemic abuses that make more fliers miserable . I think the amount of unfocused unhappiness on airplanes is due to the full airplanes and decreasing legroom in the back of the airplane , where most of us sit . <p> When I started covering airlines in 1990 , load factors ( percentage of seats filled with passengers ) was 62 percent . To put it another way , nearly four of every 10 seats was empty on the average flight . When major carriers launched a half-price sale in summer 1992 and everyone commented on how crowded the airplanes were , the loads were barely in the 70s . <p> There 's a difference between leg room and seat pitch , but reductions to either increase that cramped feeling onboard . <p> Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside you unless you 're leaving at 5:30 a.m. or 10:30 p.m . U.S. airlines averaged loads of nearly 85 percent on domestic flights last year . It was over 87 percent in June and July 2016 . That means there 's a packed airplane on most flights between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m . <p> Our perception of crowding is as much as how much room we have beside us as we have in front of us . And if you 're sitting between two big passengers -- or even two small ones -- you 're more stressed than if you are n't sandwiched in there . Then you add in the fact that they 've taken an inch or two from your legroom and you realize you 're stuck in your little narrow prison for the next one to 12 hours . <p> American Airlines recently said it was reducing the pitch -- the spacing between seat rows -- on its next generation of Boeing 737s , in the economy section . Other airlines have reduced pitch . New-design seats that are thinner may minimize the space that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a long trip any shorter . <p> I think it may be about time for the federal government to step in and set some minimums on legroom . I do n't like adding regulations , but someone has to protect the passengers from the race to the bottom in economy coach .

The data in this report is largely contained in Knights of Columbus ' 990 tax forms filed for the years 2013 , 2014 and 2015 , as well as from news releases and other statements contained on the organization 's website . While no simple means exists to measure the effect of the Knights ' spending , there is hardly a corner of the Catholic world where the resources of this international force have not left an impression . <p> The organization 's money has restored Roman antiquities ; rescued , to the tune of tens of millions , an abandoned facility in Washington D.C. , built to honor the organization 's favorite pope , St. John Paul II ; and provided communications hardware over decades to the Vatican 's public relations and news apparatus .

For more than a decade and a half , under the leadership of a former political operative , the Knights of Columbus has increasingly used its enormous wealth to influence the direction of the church , underwriting think tanks and news outlets while gaining entr ? e to some of the highest levels of decision-making in the church . <p> Its capacity for funding has given the Knights of Columbus an inordinately loud voice , potentially drowning out that of others , and no other lay group can match the Knights ' ability to leave its mark on the church .

Kauffman 's Faith and Fraternalism : A History of the Knights of Columbus 1882-1982 , McGivney , while viewing a fraternal order  as a pastoral necessity in protecting the faith ,  also wrote to another priest :  Our primary object is to prevent our people from entering Secret Societies by offering the same if not better advantages to our members italics in original .

The Knights no longer need take a defensive stance . <p> Kauffman documents that the Knights helped Catholics prove their loyalty to the United States by mobilizing church members behind World War I. As a result , he writes ,  the Order was infused with the self-confidence that it could respond with organizational skill and with social and political power to any need of Church and society . In this sense , the K. of C. reflected the passage of American Catholicism from an immigrant Church to a well-established and respected religious denomination which had proven its patriotic loyalty in the acid test of the Great War .  <p> Knights sing during the Aug. 5 , 2014 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbus in Orlando , Fla .

Dahlkemper had previously publicly defended federal restrictions on the use of taxpayer funds for abortion . <p> The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty , a legal group that has carried the fight for the U.S. bishops and the Little Sisters of the Poor against the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act , received $300,000 in one 2014 donation and an additional $25,000 from the Knights of Columbus as  a sponsor of the Canterbury Medal .  Supreme Knight Anderson received the award in 2007 , and Chaput in 2009 . <p> The Little Sisters of the Poor had received $100,000 in 2013 and another $20,000 in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received another $25,000 in 2015 . <p> A total of $525,000 was spent in two amounts in 2014 to support the March for Life and the March for Life Education and Defense Fund . The March for Life is held each January in Washington to protest the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that liberalized the nation 's abortion law . The Knights of Columbus also made a $255,000 gift to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund in 2015 , according to the Form 990 for Knights of Columbus for that year . <p> The Ethics and Public Policy Center , a conservative think tank that is home for neoconservative scholar George Weigel , received $330,000 in 2014 . Weigel , one of the more prominent voices of the Catholic right , also is a member of the board of the Institute on Religion and Public Life , which publishes First Things , a journal to which he regularly contributes , that has influentially shaped the narrative of the Catholic right during the John Paul II and Benedict XVI papacies . The center received $98,000 in 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast to  gather people to renew our dedication to faith and this great republic ,  according to one of the 990 forms . <p> The Knights gave $50,000 each year , in 2014 and 2015 , to the Federalist Society , described in a recent New Yorker article as  a nationwide organization of conservative lawyers  whose executive vice president , Leonard Leo ,  served , in effect , as Trump 's subcontractor on the selection of Neil Gorsuch  as nominee , eventually confirmed , for justice to the Supreme Court . Aside from Leo 's reputation as a devout Catholic , the society is thoroughly secular and largely an operation benefiting the Republican Party . <p> Pro-life advocates with the Indiana State Knights of Columbus carry a banner past the U.S. Supreme Court Jan. 27 during the annual March for Life in Washington .

The donation to the news program in 2015 was $250,000 . Another $250,000 to EWTN was listed on a different 990 in 2015 and was described as  general support .  <p> The Association for Catholic Information of Englewood , Colorado , received $245,000 in 2014 to  support operations of Catholic News Agency ,  an online outlet distributed free of charge . According to its website , it was founded in 2004 in response to John Paul II 's call for a new evangelization . In the United States , it pays particular attention to  news related to the creation of a culture of life .  In June 2014 , Catholic News Agency and its sister organization , ACI Prensa , a Spanish-language Catholic news organization , joined the EWTN Global Catholic Network . ACI Prensa 's headquarters are in Lima , Peru , and it also operates the Brazil-based ACI Digital , a Portuguese-language service . <p> The Knights also fund Crux , an online Catholic news outlet run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was initiated by The Boston Globe in 2014 but lasted less than two years for lack of advertising revenue . The site has not been in business long enough in its current form to show up on a Knights 990 filing , but in an email answer to an NCR query , Allen said that the Knights of Columbus contributes $350,000 a year  against a total budget of around  $850,000 . Advertising earns Crux about $125,000 a year , he said , and other support comes from the DeSales Media Group in the Diocese of Brooklyn , New York , and from the Archdioceses of Washington , New York and Los Angeles . <p> Allen has previously made the case in interviews for his publication 's independence , saying the Knights have no control over content . He did so again , writing ,  Our agreement with all our sponsors is that editorial control remains with us , and they 've all respected that .  <p> In other areas , including more communication projects , in 2013 through 2015 , the Knights spent : <p> $20,201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unnamed . <p> $147,000 to  support HD broadcast of canonizations  ; $50,000 in  support of various programs and communications  in East Asia and the Pacific ; and , also in East Asia and the Pacific , $50,000 in 2014 to support a papal visit ( Pope Francis visited Korea in 2014 ) and $33,000 to support satellite uplinks during the papal visit . <p> $53,496 in North America to  support programs and communications ,  without specifics . <p> $48,425 in North America to  support development of website ,  without specifying . <p> $60,000 to the Catholic Information Center in Washington , D.C. , an outlet run by two priests who are members of Opus Dei , a conservative order for which John Paul II created a  personal prelature ,  which amounts , essentially , to a global diocese . <p> $207,456 in Europe to  support broadcast expenses for papal ceremonies .  <p> $100,000 to support the  Holy See 's strategic communications office .  <p> The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments received $100,000 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liturgical texts . Vox Clara is a committee of bishops established by the congregation in 2001 to take over the work of the previous International Commission on English in the Liturgy and provide a more traditional , literal translation from a Latin text . <p> The Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious , a conservative alternative to the much larger Leadership Conference of Women Religious , received $365,000 in 2014 for its National Assembly and eucharistic council . <p> $158,400 went to the Catholic University of America to establish a  Pope Benedict XVI Chair in theology .  Catholic University received $328,600 in 2015 for support of educational conferences and the Benedict XVI  chair in theology fund .  <p> Two amounts , $344,277 and $226,351 , were listed on the 2014 document as made in North America with no other identification than  support various programs .  <p> The Knights refused to answer any questions regarding the figures listed on the tax forms . NCR had sought explanations for some of the unspecified amounts and for the different forms filed . In each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms were filed . One of the forms is for Knights of Columbus Charities Inc . PDF links : 2013 , 2014 and 2015 and contains donations primarily but not exclusively to women 's health and pregnancy centers across the country , as well as international donations . A second form , for Knights of Columbus Charities USA Inc . PDF links : 2013 , 2014 and 2015 , contains amounts given to Catholic institutions such as parishes , dioceses and a few colleges and universities . The third , for simply Knights of Columbus PDF links : 2013 , 2014 and 2015 , contains most of the donations to think tanks , news outlets and agencies involved in hot-button cultural issues . <p> The response from Cullen , Knights spokesman , was curt . In an email , responding to the questions , he wrote :  The Knights of Columbus fulfills all legal requirements concerning reporting related to Form 990 . We do not generally comment on tax filings .  <p> Between 2010 and 2014 , according to earlier NCR reporting , the Knights spent more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included speakers opposing homosexuality , same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting . Presentations included psychologically discredited claims that people who identify as gay or transgender can be  cured  through counseling and can become heterosexual . <p> The anti-gay training for bishops is coordinated by the National Catholic Bioethics Center , according to a 2014 report in NCR by Nicole Sotelo . The center is another organization that receives Knights of Columbus support . In 2014 , it received $250,000 ; in 2015 , $300,617 . <p> Much of the political activity in recent years appears to align with Anderson 's earlier political life . His official biography on the Knights website notes his  distinguished career as a public servant ,  but provides none of the particulars . He began his public career working for Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina , known throughout his five-term career as one of the most conservative members of Congress . Helms was an ardent supporter of the death penalty and military spending and opposed civil rights legislation and arms control . <p> Anderson later worked in the Reagan White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of public liaison , dealing with domestic policy , Catholics and family issues . <p> Notably , when the issue of AIDS first surfaced , Anderson differed with then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on how to speak of the disease . Anderson wanted the government to use language that contained moral judgments about those afflicted . According to Koop 's autobiography , Anderson also wanted the surgeon general to say that  all Americans not most Americans , as Koop maintained are opposed to homosexuality , promiscuity of any kind and prostitution .  Koop wrote that Anderson  did not seem to understand that I could not say it because it was not true .  <p> Knights in context <p> Faggioli , a contributing editor to Commonweal and author of The Rising Laity : Ecclesial Movements Since Vatican II , sees the Knights of Columbus  as an extreme version  of a post-Vatican II phenomenon , the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves , apart from any identification with the local church or diocese or a ritual community . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism , a kind of lobbying that actually alters the church 's ecclesiology . Underwriting conservative outlets and think tanks , he said , means  you can shape the narrative so a rather limited number of conservative Catholic voices from the West can have their voices heard much louder than the whole African Catholic community on some issues .  <p> The Knights are rarely mentioned as comparable to such overtly evangelical groups as the Focolare Movement , Communion and Liberation , the Neocatechumenal Way or like organizations that rose to international prominence in the post-Vatican II era . But the Knights ' influence may be as profound or greater than any of those in its funding of church entities and of groups that influence thought and ideology in the public sphere . <p> Greg Repta and Walter Komarnicki cook cod Feb. 12 during the St. Eugene Parish fish fry sponsored by the Knights of Columbus in Chicago . ( CNS/Catholic New World/Karen Callaway ) <p> The Knights of Columbus has , throughout its history , been quite political , often taking a very conservative and at times ultra-patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it boldly repudiated the views of such hate groups as the Ku Klux Klan , even publishing a book by noted black writer W.E.B . Du Bois , one in a series of books published as correctives to the Klan 's revisionist history . <p> But Kauffman , in Faith and Fraternalism , also makes the point that in the years after Vatican II , as the  Catholic anti-defamation character  of the order began to fade , the leadership  attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church .  That led , post-1960s , to the formation of a  variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church .  <p> Simultaneously , new initiatives resulted in leaps in membership numbers and revenue . And with the increase in funds came a flurry of activity , a substantial amount of it aimed at funding Vatican projects and initiatives of the U.S. bishops . <p> One area in which the Knights recognized a need was in Vatican communications . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Knights donated a shortwave transmitter to Vatican Radio , and has helped upgrade the communications systems ever since . In 1974 , for instance , the Knights were approached  to seek support for a significant expansion of televised Masses .  <p> The following year , the Knights began sponsorship of annual telecasts of Christmas Eve Midnight Mass , the Stations of the Cross from the Coliseum on Good Friday , Easter Sunday Mass ,  and a special ceremony that would be determined each year ,  according to the Knights website . <p> In the years since and through 2010 , the order has upgraded transmission systems to provide broadcasts to larger areas of the globe , as well as  the outfitting of a mobile unit with recording and transmitting equipment to enable Vatican television to broadcast in high definition .  That has enabled broadcasts of major events like installations and elections of popes , World Youth Day , and ecumenical gatherings in Assisi . <p> The Knights , in turn , are well-represented in the upper echelons of the Vatican . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council for Social Communications , a position he still held in 2015 . He is a member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity , the Pontifical Council for Family , and the Pontifical Academy for Life . He previously served on the board of the Vatican bank . <p> Is such access the result of wielding influence -- a consequence of unparalleled wealth -- or simply reward for doing good work ? Or a bit of both ? <p>  From an ecclesiological point of view ,  said Faggioli ,  it is a distortion because the Catholic Church is based on an idea of leadership where the sensus fidelium , the voice of the faithful , should be equal for all the faithful .  No equivalent organization exists to represent those who may hold differing theological views or to represent the interests of Catholics in the developing world . Undoubtedly , those affected by natural and human-caused disasters are grateful for aid . But how do laypeople in those circumstances gain similar access as Knights ' leadership to Vatican agencies and officials ? <p>  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  so the sense of the faith in Africa or Latin America or Asia , with no money , should carry the same weight , currency , relevance , authority , as a wealthy Catholic in the Northern Hemisphere .  <p> Catholic historian David O'Brien has a somewhat softer view , acknowledging the  incredible amount of good work  done by ordinary members of the Knights of Columbus at the parish and diocesan levels . He wonders , however , if there is a kind of split in worldview between those levels and the higher echelons of the organization . <p> He said Anderson seems to have tapped into  this broader kind of need for identity that conservative people within the church  have felt since the reforms of Vatican II . It is an element in the U.S. church , he said , that feels the denomination has  lost its edge , its identity and maybe even its integrity  over the past half century . <p> The Knights of Columbus is among groups that have  come up with issues that create the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These guys have figured out a way to build a popular following by combining their politics with the faith .  <p> The religious liberty campaign , he said ,  was a brilliant , if misguided , effort to combine these two things .  <p> If religion and politics can be flashpoints for conflict , combining them does n't seem to have damaged the Knights ' bottom line or their ability to remain close to the ecclesial centers of power . In his 2015 report , according to the Knights of Columbus website ,  Supreme Knight Anderson said that insurance in force is at $99 billion , an amount that has more than doubled in the last 12 years .  In the 2015 Form 990 for Knights of Columbus , the organization reports total revenue of $2.234 billion , down about $50 million from the total of $2.285 billion in 2014 . In 2015 , it showed expenses of $2.165 billion , leaving a net gain of $68,859,419 , down from a net gain of $115,076,047 with expenses of $2.170 billion in 2014 . Net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $1.905 billion the year before . <p> Anderson , who earned a degree in philosophy from Seattle University , a Jesuit institution , and a law degree from the University of Denver , has published several books and has been amply awarded with honorary degrees from Catholic institutions and honors from various other organizations . His status has provided him rare face time with popes and , in addition to his Vatican positions , appointments as the only layperson from North America to serve as an auditor at the world Synod of Bishops in 2001 , 2005 and 2008 . He has served on a number of committees of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops . His papal honors include Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sylvester , a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great , and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem . 
@@18446360 <p> A proposal to kill a century-old business tax provision -- one that 's been key to President Donald Trump 's real estate fortune -- is poised to become the next great tax-reform fight in Washington . <p> House Republicans want the $1 trillion that ending a deduction for businesses ' interest expenses would raise so they can offset the cost of slashing the corporate tax rate , one of the centerpieces of their tax-reform plans . <p> Story Continued Below <p> But that is riling a host of industries that say they have little choice but to rely on borrowed money and fear they will face big tax increases . Farmers , private equity , utilities , real estate , manufacturers and others are raising alarms in the Capitol , where Republicans are divided over the proposal . <p> Though it 's been obscured by the long-running battle over border adjustments , as that debate fades , many predict the interest-deduction fight will soon take center stage . <p>  This is going to be a big deal -- it just has n't had its time yet ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Taxation and longtime congressional tax aide . <p> It 's crucial to House Republicans ' plans because it 's their second-largest pay-for , raising even more money than border adjustments , according to an analysis by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation . <p> But Trump has long backed the deduction , important to his real-estate development business -- which is certain to raise anew conflict-of-interest issues for his administration . <p>  It 's controversial ,  said Texas Sen. John Cornyn , the chamber 's deputy Republican leader .  I think we need to be careful because there are a lot of businesses that borrow money as part of their business model .  <p> What , if anything , to do with the break is now a  significant  part of lawmakers ' tax talks , said one top Republican aide , though how vulnerable it is depends on how they decide to proceed . <p> If they opt to pursue a deficit-neutral tax reform , as House Republicans are pushing , there could be big changesbecause lawmakers will need a lot of budget savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If they decide to simply cut taxes , without pay-fors , there will be less pressure to cut the provision . <p>  Its usage will be determined by how low of a corporate rate members want to get to , and if it 's going to be deficit-neutral or if it 's going to be a tax cut ,  the aide said . <p> As part of their tax-reform plan , House Republicans want to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent , from the current 35 percent -- a reduction that would be so deep that they had to look beyond the usual roster of loopholes for ways to finance it . Trump wants a 15 percent rate and he told The Economist it would be  OK  if tax cuts were n't offset . <p> Interest expenses have long been considered a normal business expense that companies can deduct just as they would their employees ' wages or their rent . Lawmakers have rarely tinkered with the provision , let alone proposed ending it . <p> Back in 1987 , amid a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those sorts of mergers , which sparked a big selloff on Wall Street . <p> House Republicans also want to kill the deduction so they can adopt so-called expensing , which refers to allowing businesses to immediately write off the cost of their investments , instead of having to spread those deductions out over a number of years . <p> That 's considered important for long-term growth , but experts say expensing ca n't be combined with the interest deduction because that would provide such rich tax benefits that the government would effectively be paying companies to buy equipment , so lawmakers have to pick one or the other . <p> A spokeswoman for House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( R-Texas ) said :  Republicans have proposed full and immediate expensing for all businesses because it will deliver robust economic growth and create jobs .  <p> Their interest-deduction proposal is backed by many economists who say the code so heavily subsidizes debt that it pushes companies wanting to raise money to turn to loans rather than equity . And that can make economic downturns more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they can not meet the demands of their creditors ,  the Tax Foundation said in a recent report .  The more a firm borrows , the more it owes in interest , and if it can not pay interest , bondholders can make claims on the firm 's physical assets to get their money back .  <p>  In contrast , equity is much more flexible ; during downturns , equity simply accepts a loss of shareholder value . It may not accept that loss happily , but it accepts it nonetheless , and there is no immediate threat to the health of the firm .  <p> But the debate is underscoring how much some industries rely on loans . Among them : farmers , whose opposition to the plan is likely to weigh heavily on red-state Republicans . <p>  Farming andranching is almost completely financed with borrowed money ,  said Patricia Wolff , senior director of congressional relations at the American Farm BureauFederation .  There are n't stock options of venture capital or other ways for us to raise money so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and from USDA programs , so anything that makes capital more expensive adds to the cost of business .  <p>  Even with the lower proposed taxrates , we could see a tax increase ,  she said . <p> Critics of the plan are taking solace in the fact that Trump has long opposed the idea . It was not included in his revised tax plan rolled out last month , and he rejected the proposal during his presidential campaign , said former tax adviser Stephen Moore . <p>  Trump did n't like it because he 's a real estate guy , and a lot of real-estate deals are financed with debt so he squashed the idea ,  said Moore , who helped developed the campaign 's tax plan .  He felt like debt was an integral part of financing business deals so we did n't get very far with that idea .  <p> During his campaign , Trump did eventually propose allowing manufacturers to choose between expensing and the interest deduction , though many experts say that is probably unworkable because Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals . That 's because they assume businesses that rely on expensing will choose that , and those with big loans will opt for the interest deduction , leaving relatively few businesses paying little to the Treasury . <p> Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) is also wary of the House proposal , telling Bloomberg Television :  Almost everybody is borrowing at this particular point , and some borrowing in big ways , so I think that 's going to be on the table , but I think it 's going to be difficult to get rid of that .  <p> Added Sen.

18447290," In writing papal encyclicals , many popes have taken courageous stances against the spirit or powers of the age . The titles Rerum Novarum , Pascendi , and Humanae Vitae come readily to mind . And yet , there is one papal encyclical that stands out both for its bold opposition to evil and for the dramatic means taken to present it to its intended audience . Issued by Pope Pius XI in 1937 as a response to Hitler 's demonic Nazi regime , it was titled Mit brennender Sorge . <p> In modern times , many seem eager to believe anything and everything negative regarding the Catholic Church , regardless of how bizarre the legend or conspiracy theory may be . One such theory is the supposed complicity of the Vatican and other influential Catholics toward Hitler 's Nazi regime . Of course , such a position completely collapses under the weight of solid historical investigation performed in such books as The Myth of Hitler 's Pope : Pope Pius XII and His Secret War Against Nazi Germany by Rabbi David G. Dalin ; Hitler , the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False Witness : Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History by Rodney Stark . <p> In word and deed , both Pope Pius XI and Pope Pius XII were devastating opponents of Nazism , and the issuance of Mit brennender Sorge -- largely written by the future Pius XII and issued during the reign of Pius XI -- was the philosophical hallmark of that opposition to Nazism . By 1937 , Pope Pius XI wanted to address the situation directly to German Catholics . Since this would be completely impossible , he did the next best thing . He issued this encyclical , whose title translates into English as  With burning anxiety .  <p> There were a number of unique aspects of the encyclical . First , its unique and original authorship in German was a sign of solidarity with faithful Catholics in Germany and as a reminder of exactly who the encyclical was holding in contempt . Second , Mit brennender Sorge exhibited something rarely seen in papal documents : anger . Consider the following passage : <p> The experiences of these last years have fixed responsibilities and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war of extermination . In the furrows , where We tried to sow the seed of a sincere peace , other men - the ' enemy ' of Holy Scripture -- oversowed the cockle of distrust , unrest , hatred , defamation , of a determined hostility overt or veiled , fed from many sources and wielding many tools , against Christ and His Church . They , and they alone with their accomplices , silent or vociferous , are today responsible , should the storm of religious war , instead of the rainbow of peace , blacken the German skies . <p> Pope Pius goes on to illustrate the inherent contradiction between Nazism and Christianity : <p> In your country , Venerable Brethren , voices are swelling into a chorus urging people to leave the Church , and among the leaders there is more than one whose official position is intended to create the impression that this infidelity to Christ the King constitutes a signal and meritorious act of loyalty to the modern State . <p> If anger was rare in encyclicals , contempt and mockery were even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial minds could stumble into concepts of a national God , of a national religion ; or attempt to lock within the frontiers of a single people , within the narrow limits of a single race , God , the Creator of the universe ... <p> Ronald Rychlak writes that Pope Pius ' encyclical  was one of the strongest condemnations of any national regime that the Holy See ever published .  <p> But there was something else that made Mit brennender Sorge unique : the method of delivery . From the Latin , the word  encyclical  means  to circle ,  meaning that it is meant to be widely distributed . And though all encyclicals are intended to be distributed far and wide , none in history have been delivered quite like Mit brennender Sorge . Pope Pius and his advisors realized that they could not simply print this encyclical letter and casually mail it to the many Catholic churches in Germany without the authorities noticing . Were they to find it , the Gestapo would never allow it to be distributed . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Germany , and distributed to Catholic printers . An estimated three hundred thousand copies were printed , and under the cover of night on March 11 , Mit brennender Sorge was delivered to Catholic churches throughout the nation . <p> The next morning , Palm Sunday , 1937 , priests throughout Germany read the encyclical letter to their congregations . The numbers are staggering . As Dalin writes , the encyclical was  read in its entirety from the pulpit 's of all of Germany 's Catholic Churches ...  It is estimated that over twenty million German Catholics heard the encyclical in virtual unison that morning . This must have been a surreal experience for all involved . Reading the encyclical from the pulpit was a shocking act of open defiance against Hitler and his regime . Everyone involved -- priests , printers , couriers -- risked death or imprisonment . Indeed , some were imprisoned for their  crime .  <p> Perhaps even more astonishing was the fact that none of the Nazis saw it coming . Rychlak writes :  The only reason Mit brennender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught off guard . By the time Palm Sunday Mass was over , Gestapo guards were at the church doors to confiscate copies .  Yes , they were confiscated , but not before millions of German Catholics had heard the message . The delivery of Mit brennender Sorge was one of the great and heroic clandestine efforts against Hitler , before or during World War II . <p> Though it was written for a particular time and place , Mit brennender Sorge contains a beautiful and powerful defense of truth . Many anonymous heroes sacrificed their careers and jeopardized their lives in order to make these truths known . This story should not only inspire us to read it today , but it should also inspire us to read more of the encyclicals that the popes have issued over the years . In the Church 's many encyclicals , a wealth of knowledge and wisdom awaits us . <p> And who was the person who smuggled the encyclical into Germany ? None other than Cardinal Spellman , Archbishop of New York . The Germans never suspected that this American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he crossed into Germany . <p> Posted by Joanne Newnam on Monday , May , 15 , 2017 5:57 PM ( EDT ) : <p> Geezzz ! This could be addressed to the left and the main stream media in the USA today . Reading only a few of the quotes gave me chills . The same assault by the socialist communist George Soros crowd led by the professors in universities across this nation sound remarkably like the characterizations referred to in this encyclical . The same anti freedom of speech created the circumstances in which the pope had to essentially smuggle it in to be read to the people . I 'm German American and I often wonder about all those Roman Catholics in Nazi Germany who were so easily fooled by the politics of Hitler . Thank God for Benedict and the strong resistance of his parent to protect him . They were not fooled . I worry about so many Catholics today who are fooled by the politics of abortion and the fascism of socialism and the American press that supports it . ( see Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The BVM is calling this  The Storm  and indeed it is . The attacks of President Trump are chilling . Truth is dead . Here 's praying that on the 100th anniversary of the final apparition of Fatima ( October 13 , 2017 ) her Immaculate Heart will triumph and the Storm will subside . <p> Posted by Jacob on Monday , May , 15 , 2017 5:20 PM ( EDT ) : <p> Many thanks for this article . I did know in general about this encyclical , but I had never read any excerpts or seriously pondered the risks and complications involved in publishing it in secret to be read as a kind of surprise attack on the Nazis . How ashamed the critics of the Church should be when they seriously consider this amazing and heroic moment in German history . How tragic that modern German Catholics can forget so easily the heroism of their own countrymen in opposing the demonic philosophy that lay behind the Nazi movement . <p> Posted by sursun on Monday , May , 15 , 2017 4:58 PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away with the myth of Hitler 's Pope .

Neither the driver nor Romano 's son saw each other , according to the Austin , Texas Police Department . <p> The 40-year-old Dulaney High School and Johns Hopkins University graduate died at the scene in Austin , where his mother said he was working for a remodeling company . <p>  It 's not the way life is supposed to be ,  Romano said of her son 's accidental death .  It 's not the order of life . Parents should not be burying their children .  <p> Ten months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Timonium home , Romano set out to fulfill her son 's last wishes in Ocean City May 8 with a service arranged by Florida-based Eternal Reefs . <p> The company creates reef memorials in the ocean made from a mixture of concrete and cremated human remains , said Eternal Reefs CEO George Frankel . <p> The 750 to 3,800-pound reef balls create new marine habitats for fish and other sea life , Frankel said . At a cost of $2,995 to $7,500 , the memorials also help build up oceans reefs threatened by such human activity as pollution and unsustainable fishing practices . <p> The memorials are placed in locations permitted for fishing , diving or habitat development . <p> On May 8 , Romano joined six other families on a boat ride from Ocean City into the Atlantic Ocean to say goodbye to their loved ones . She was accompanied by her daughter , son-in law , grandchildren , husband and Friedman 's college friends . <p> About four miles off shore , each family was called , one by one , to the edge of the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast into the sea the reef ball memorial they 'd helped to make just days before . <p> Romano read a poem from a greeting card she 'd mailed to her son 15 years ago . <p>  He had saved it ,  Romano said .  When his reef went down I read the poem . That 's what it says on his plaque -- ' Believe in Yourself . ' Sometimes , when things get tough , people give up , but he never did .  <p> Once placed , Eternal Reef staff dedicated the memorials with a short passage from a speech given by former President John F. Kennedy , and , as a final tribute , crew members sounded the boat horn three times before heading to shore . <p> Evolving traditions <p> The ocean ceremony is one of many alternative burial methods gaining popularity alongside a rise in cremation , said Mike Nicodemus , vice president of the National Funeral Directors Association . <p> According to the group , public preference for and acceptance of cremation has risen over the last 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The percentage of families that choose cremation is expected to rise in 2017 to 51.6 percent and reach more than 70 percent by 2030 , according to the NFDA . <p> Families are choosing traditional burials less often for a variety of reasons , Nicodemus explained . <p>  You have a family get together and -- especially if no one has talked about what to do -- you have families just putting together ideas ,  he said .  Everyone comes up with some type of reason and comes up with a happy medium , and that 's what they do . There 's really no sort of research as to why the trend has changed , as much as this is just a personal choice for the families .  <p> Cremation may also cost significantly less than traditional cemetery burials , Nicodemus said . <p> While a traditional burial costs about $3,000 before embalming , facilities fees , visitation or a casket , an immediate cremation , without a viewing , can cost under $2,500 , according to NFDA statistics . <p> After cremation , Nicodemus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remains made into jewelry . Others have used ashes to create a fireworks display , while one company uses a mix of ashes and paint to create custom paintings . <p> The increase in cremation is also being seen in Towson , said Ruck Funeral Homes president Michael Ruck Sr. The Towson funeral home , which has operated in the Baltimore area for 93 years , also has a crematorium . <p> Though Ruck said he could n't attribute a specific number to the increase in cremations , about 30 percent of families he sees now choose that option , an  incremental  increase from 10 years ago , he said . <p>  Certainly the number of families we serve is increasing ,  he said of the crematorium .  There 's a certain comfort level knowing that we can do everything right here .  <p> Once a person is cremated , families choose the next step , Ruck said . Most still choose traditional burials , but the fraction that choose Eternal Reefs , or other non-traditional methods , has risen alongside the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also realizing they can have any type of funeral service before cremation ,  Ruck said . <p> ' A sense of contribution ' <p> After her son was cremated , Romano asked friends and family to make gifts to strangers of random acts of kindness , something she said her son would have wanted . <p> Frankel attributes families interest in alternative burial methods and ceremonies to a desire to get more involved in seeing off their family members . <p> Since going into business 17 years ago , Eternal Reefs has placed more than 2,000 reef memorials in the Atlantic Ocean and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico . <p>  They take ownership and there 's a real sense of contribution ,  Frankel said .  You 're seeing a sea change in how people are viewing memorialization . They 're not seeing the same value in a casket they see for an hour .  <p> Three days before the ceremony , Friedman 's family and friends mixed his ashes in with an ocean-safe concrete blend . <p> After the concrete ball was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedman enjoyed , or of things the 40-year-old never got to do -- a Jewish star for his religion , Orioles pins , coins from places Friedman traveled and a million dollars in shredded currency . <p> Though shredded currency has no monetary value it can be purchased from the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing as a novelty item . <p> The family also included a model of his dream BMW car and a picture of Friedman 's cat , Isabelle . <p> Romano said the ceremony brought closure in knowing her son 's ashes would go toward helping the environment . <p>  I know Barry is no longer here , but when I look in the ocean , I know he is at peace and making a small , but positive , impact that will last beyond our lifetime ,  Romano said .

As the Washington Postnotes , over the weekend there were technically bipartisan calls for Trump to turn over the tapes to Congress , if they exist . But the Republican effort to get to the bottom of the president 's shocking claim basically consisted of two GOP senators saying it would be great if the president would explain himself . <p> Sunday on Meet the Press , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he thinks former FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Graham sits on .  Did the president ever say anything to the director of the FBI that would be construed as trying to impede the investigation ?  Graham mused .

If there are any tapes of this conversation , they need to be turned over . I doubt if there are . But we need to clear the air .  <p> On Fox News Sunday , Senator Mike Lee said he thinks  it 's probably inevitable  that the tapes will be subpoenaed by Congress , though he did n't suggest that he would have any role in making that happen . When asked what he thinks of the possibility that President Trump set up a taping system in the White House , Lee said ,  I do n't know ,  noting that  it has n't always turned out well  for other presidents . <p> Unsurprisingly , Democrats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN 's State of the Union that if the tapes exist , the president should turn them over to Congress and investigators  immediately ,  and  to destroy them would be a violation of law .

We have got to make sure that these tapes , if they exist , do n't mysteriously disappear ,  Warner said . <p> Several House Democrats have already attempted to obtain the tapes . Last week , Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi sent a letter asking White House Counsel Donald McGahn to send any recordings of Trump 's conversations with Comey to the House Oversight Committee .

The President 's actions also risk undermining the ongoing criminal and counter-intelligence investigations and the independence of federal law enforcement agencies .  <p> So far , nothing has come of these requests , and if the vast majority of GOP lawmakers remain ambivalent about the possibility that the president secretly taped the FBI director , perhaps nothing ever will .

@@18447303 <h> Special elections offer test for politics of ObamaCare repeal <p> The GOP 's push to repeal and replace ObamaCare has spilled into the special elections in Montana and Georgia , creating showcases for how the healthcare bill could shape the 2018 midterms . <p> Democrats hoping that the controversial bill 's passage in the House will help them take the lower chamber next year are now looking for any signs of voter pushback in the special elections . <p> The GOP nominees in both special elections have taken different positions on the bill , which has repeatedly polled at below 30 percent support . In Montana , Greg Gianforte publicly distanced himself , but in leaked audio of a private call , he was supportive of its passage . Meanwhile in Georgia , Karen Handel came out strongly in favor of the bill , which was embraced by President Trump . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p>  It 's hard to say how much one vote matters , but the vote in Congress on the American Health Care Act -- that crystallizes liberal opposition to the Trump administration ,  said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Helena , Mont . <p>  Certainly with a special election in Montana the Thursday before Memorial Day , it will hurt Republicans if Democratic-leaning voters are more energized .  <p> With two weeks until Montana 's race , Gianforte , a millionaire tech entrepreneur who unsuccessfully ran for governor last year , took some heat for sending mixed signals on the bill , which narrowly passed the House last week . <p> Gianforte initially declined to take a stance on the bill , with a spokesman later saying that he  needs to know all the facts .  During a call with Washington lobbyists , though , Gianforte played up the bill 's  national significance .  <p>  The votes in the House are going to determine whether we get tax reform done , sounds like we just passed a healthcare thing , which I 'm thankful for , sounds like we 're starting to repeal and replace ,  Gianforte said on the call , according to The New York Times . <p> Gianforte 's campaign manager tried to clarify Gianforte 's private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the process of repealing ObamaCare has begun while the revised bill is still waiting on a Congressional Budget Office score . <p> Democrat Rob Quist 's campaign seized on Gianforte 's private comments , saying in a statement that voters  want a congressman who 'll shoot straight , not a dishonest politician who says one thing to Montanans and another to the millionaires behind closed doors .  <p> Quist 's campaign reported raising $550,000 in the four days since Gianforte 's remarks , bringing his fundraising total to more than $3.7 million . <p> Quist 's campaign has also targeted Gianforte over a Friday campaign event with Vice President Pence , saying the two have an anti-abortion record and want to defund Planned Parenthood . <p>  I think both sides are seeing this race as a potential referendum on what the healthcare reform that was recently passed by the House means politically ,  said a Montana Republican familiar with the race . <p>  The Democrats are smelling blood more than they thought maybe before ,  the Republican added .  They 're anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Montana and if that healthcare bill really is a problem .  <p> Republicans in the state , however , are defending Gianforte , arguing that he was praising the steps taken to start the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare instead of the bill itself . <p>  There 's almost more of a risk of the Republican base getting disillusioned if nothing got done on healthcare ,  the Montana Republican said , calling the hype over Gianforte 's comments  a tad overblown .  <p> The back-and-forth on the bill comes in the final weeks of the May 25 election . Recent polls reflect that the race is tightening as Quist , a local folk musician , now polls within single digits of his GOP opponent . Both parties and affiliated outside groups are continuing to flood the airwaves with ads . <p> In Georgia , Republican nominee Handel has been far stauncher in her support for the repeal bill . Handel 's campaign has said that she would have voted for the bill if she was in Congress . <p>  She believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while not perfect , represents just the first step in replacing Obamacare with patient-centered healthcare ,  Handel 's campaign said in a statement to the Washington Examiner . <p> Democrat Jon Ossoff has been just as full-throated in his opposition to the bill , releasing a statement following the bill 's passage that said it  puts Georgians ' lives at risk .  <p>  I strongly oppose this bill , which allows discrimination against Georgians with pre-existing conditions and would make health insurance unaffordable for millions of families ,  Ossoff said in a statement . <p> Handel and Ossoff will compete in a June 20 runoff in the most closely watched special elections of the year . Democrats have looked to mobilize their base for Ossoff , an investigative filmmaker , pouring in resources to make the reliably red district more competitive . While Republican House candidates traditionally have won the district easily , Trump won it by less than 2 points in 2016 . <p> Ossoff 's 48 percent came just short of winning the April 18 all-party primary outright , forcing a runoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , has managed to coalesce the splintered Republican Party behind her since the primary . Recent runoff polls show the race in a dead heat . <p> While the American Health Care Act plays a role in Montana 's race , some Georgia strategists see the bill having a  minimal impact  on the race and argue that it must head through the Senate to see if it could be a factor in down-ballot races . But they say Ossoff can still use the House passage of the bill against Handel . <p>  What Jon Ossoff can say is ' that 's why we need to elect more Democrats to Congress . Had I been in Congress I would have voted against this , '  said Tharon Johnson , a Georgia Democratic strategist . <p>  What he has to do is have a clear and concise message to 6th District voters about what they are possibly getting with TrumpCare and what they are losing with ObamaCare .  <p> Still , healthcare has yet to become a major factor in either race . Some political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the healthcare bill . <p> Montana 's ads have largely focused on gun rights as well as attacks on Quist 's past history of financial troubles and Gianforte 's 2009 attempt to restrict public access to a stream near his property . <p> While Handel 's campaign gears up to run TV ads in the final five weeks of the runoff , ads in Georgia have mostly targeted Ossoff , linking him to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi ( Calif. ) and criticizing his out-of-state campaign contributions . <p>  It does seem like Democrats are not going full bore on opposition to healthcare in these special elections ,  said Kyle Kondik , managing editor of Sabato 's Crystal Ball .  Both parties seem to be tiptoeing around the healthcare issue because they do n't necessarily know how it 's going to play .  <p> There are less two weeks left in Montana 's race , but Kondik said there 's still more time in the Georgia runoff for the healthcare bill to become a more defining issue . <p>  It 's possible that perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said .

@@18466025 <h> The Independent News Source <h> Search form <p> Search <h> Knights of Columbus needs to show restraint in the political sphere <p> Fifteen-month-old Charlotte Kerscher , held by her mother , Laura , watches the Knights of Columbus honor guard process during an outdoor Mass at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help in Champion , Wis. , Aug. 15 , 2016 ( CNS/Sam Lucero , The Compass ) <p> My colleague Tom Roberts ' look at the finances of the Knights of Columbus sent shockwaves around Catholic circles yesterday . Like Roberts , I commend the Knights for all the wonderful work they have done since their founding in 1882 . The questions raised by Roberts ' reporting do not detract an iota from that work , yet they are important and they all come back to one larger question : Is it time for new leadership at the Knights of Columbus ? <p> The first question is whether it is healthy for a Catholic organization to have so much money , and therefore so much influence , combined with an evident willingness to use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from politics , but not the Knights . As Roberts ' article demonstrates , they fund a variety of conservative political causes and organizations , especially those like the Ethics and Public Policy Center , which shape the public conversation about the role of religion in American culture . If the Knights are to maintain the common perception of them as a charitable organization , they need to demonstrate restraint in using their influence in the political sphere , or at least seek to strike a balance . <p> And the problem is not simply politics . The Knights deploy their influence within the church as well . Would Anderson serve on so many Vatican commissions if he did not have such a large checkbook ? Will bishops challenge the direction the Knights are taking within the church , funding conservative media outlets like Crux and EWTN , when they know that the Knights have such large influence ? Will staffers at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops more easily embark upon a conservative project , knowing they can get Knights money for it , but decline to initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise the money elsewhere ? The Knights jumped in to rescue the white elephant John Paul II Shrine founded and funded by the Archdiocese of Detroit . Other bishops noticed and made a mental note : If I am ever in trouble , I may need to turn to them too . That creates enormous influence . <p> As professors Massimo Faggioli and David O'Brien indicate in the article , the Knights represent that brand of Catholicism that believes Catholicism has  lost its edge , its identity and maybe even its integrity  over the past half century , as O'Brien said . And they have  come up with issues that create the difference between you and other religious groups and with the culture . These guys have figured out a way to build a popular following by combining their politics with the faith .  The Knights are the bank for the culture wars if you will . <p> But , like other culture-warrior Catholic conservatives , the Knights do not challenge every aspect of the dominant culture . Take a look at their salaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 , so that year he only made $1,277,232 . He made more than $2 million the year before . To be clear : If Anderson were paid $400,000 it would still be too much , but more than a million ? <p> Our readers rely on NCR 's independent voice to better understand today 's news and its intersection with their faith . We could n't do this work without your help . Please donate today . <p> The comment by the Knights ' spokesman , Joseph Cullen , makes my point better than I can . He said that an analysis of Anderson 's compensation  by a well-respected and unnamed external consulting firm -- shows that 75 percent of CEOs within a market comparative group are compensated overall at a higher rate than he is . Our CEO is responsible not only for overseeing the operations of a charitable organization but the operations of a Fortune 1000 life insurance company as well .  How many times has Pope Francis reminded the Church that we are not an NGO , let alone an LLC ! Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Knights are a Christian organization and pay stubs in seven figures are simply not consistent with the Gospel call to poverty . If Anderson wants to be paid like a CEO of a major , secular corporation , let him go work for one . It is ironic that Anderson , like so many conservative Catholics , is a frequent critic of secularization , and urges Catholics to stand apart from the ambient culture when that culture challenges our faith , to make our  Catholic identity  clear , but that desire to be countercultural apparently vanishes when it comes time to calculate his compensation . <p> It is ironic , too , that the Knights have earned a reputation for their spirit of volunteerism . The members not only donate money and pay dues , but they give their time and do so at no cost . I wonder what they think about the organization feathering so many beds , and with such feathers , while the charism of the order is so obviously different . Cullen reminds us that Anderson is also a CEO of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you are going to invoke a corporate model , should n't you follow it ? Anderson did not rise through the ranks of an insurance company , developing the kind of expertise that might warrant such a large salary . <p> Anderson is not alone . You look at the salaries of football coaches at Catholic schools and CEOs at Catholic hospitals . And you wonder why we sometimes lose track of our sense of mission . I do not begrudge anyone a living . I understand , too , that in certain occupations , there are expenses that a lowly writer who works from home does not have . I suppose CEOs need several suits , and I only need one . They may have to fly around more than I do , although I suspect the company pays that tab . But , when so much of what is wrong with the West is rooted in the idolatry of money , would n't it be great to see our Catholic organizations look a little harder for leadership that grasps how morally obscene it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do ? Could n't we see a little more Christian witness in this area ? <p> I also want to highlight a specific concern about the political spending by the organization , and draw what I think is an important distinction . I applaud the Knights for their efforts to promote a culture of life , and to defend the unborn , but the Susan B. Anthony List , which received $1 million in 2014 , is more of a Republican operation than a pro-life one . In 2010 , they did not target pro-choice Democrats in the midterm elections , they targeted pro-life Democrats . The group argued that voting for the Affordable Care Act invalidated the pro-life credentials of these Democrats because the law permitted federal funding for elective abortion . In fact , it did no such thing . <p> I would not give two cents to the Ethics and Public Policy Center , not least because it provides a handsome position and salary to George Weigel , a man who can no longer even pretend to be anything but a critic of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion in the public square and while it leans heavily to the right , it is not explicitly partisan . Same for the donations to the Becket Fund . They lean heavily to the right , but at least they are involved in the defense of religious liberty , an obvious concern of the church too . <p> But why do the Knights , which profess fidelity to the pope and the bishops , give money to the Federalist Society ? The organization has precisely no religious mission . What is more , the Federalist Society website states ,  The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order .  Pope Francis just denounced libertarianism in the clearest of terms , a denunciation that was hardly novel , echoing papal teaching at least as far back as Pope Pius XI . <p> The Knights underwrite about a third of the budget of Crux , edited by former NCR Vatican correspondent John Allen . Allen told Roberts ,  Our agreement with all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've all respected that .  Yet , the online magazine tilts hard to the right and features a host of papal critics such as Fr . Raymond de Souza and former priest Thomas Williams , who also works for Breitbart . <p> One other area of funding is remarkable . Giving $1.5 million to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and $435,000 to the Archdiocese of Baltimore makes me want to ask the Knights at our local parish : You pay dues , how come our diocese is not getting such handsome checks from Mr. Anderson ? I would not object if they were giving such large sums to desperately poor dioceses in the Global South , but Philadelphia ? <p> It is time for new leadership at the Knights . It was a mistake to hire a political operative as supreme knight , and not just any political operative , but one who got his start working for Sen. Jesse Helms , a racist bigot who did as much to poison race relations as any politician of his era . It would be one thing if Mr. Anderson were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a start with their home senator . Anderson is not from North Carolina . I know from mutual friends that he loves the church , but lots of people love the church and they are not able to wield such great influence because they do not control the purse strings of the Knights . <p> The Knights will continue to do good work , to be sure , no matter who is in the leadership . But , they can do that work without also funding a bunch of right-wing causes in both church and state . They tarnish their own efforts by engaging in partisanship and near-partisanship as their 990s reveal . The bishops who provide cover for the Knights , and show up in such great number at the annual convention , they need to start asking questions about this funding , or stay away entirely until the organization charts a new , less politicized course . And , they should insist that Anderson retire and that his replacement be someone committed to having the Knights justified reputation for charity no longer be sullied by the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture wars . <p> Michael Sean Winters covers the nexus of religion and politics for NCR.

18469592," The question remains , what type of game will this be ? So far Nintendo has given us Mario Run and Fire Emblem Heroes . These are both obviously different in mechanics and pricing from their mainline console titles . Mario Run , of course , is a runner game that costs $10 to unlock the full content . To no one 's surprise , many thought that the price was too high for what you received . Then there is Fire Emblem Heroes , which turned out to be a gacha game with poor drop rates . Sure both mobile games still have their fans , but to think that these are anywhere near the quality of Nintendo 's console offerings , well , you would be kidding yourself . <p> So far details are pretty light on what The Legend of Zelda 's mobile version will offer . What we do know is that it is rumored to be released after Nintendo 's next mobile title Animal Crossing . Keep in mind that this release window may change . Considering how tight-lipped Nintendo is when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few specific details until the game is officially announced . <p> Personally , I am going to stay cautiously optimistic for The Legend of Zelda on Android . I would think that it would be an odd choice for Nintendo to tarnish the series with freemium idiocy after they just reinvigorated it with The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild . So far both mobile games from Nintendo have had different pricing models . Maybe this trend will continue . Though , the fact that Fire Emblem Heroes IAP filled pricing model has made a ton more money than Mario Run 's more honest method of paying in full for the entire game is a bit of worry . <p> So what do you dear readers think ? Will this be another title filled with gacha and IAPs , or will Nintendo do us right with a worthwhile Zelda release on Android ? <p> I could see that , a good Zenonia game with Zelda dungeons . That would be fun . A puzzle game would be another interesting take . Something like The Room , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn based zelda game . But as a spin-off for the switch .

You 'll probably find an item near the beginning of the stage ( like 4 Swords Adventures or Triforce Heroes ) . It 'd be cool if they implemented multiplayer like 4 Swords now that I think about it , but still unlikely . <p> I think it 'll have a format similar to Mario Run , flat price tag with you being able to access a few sections of the map from the get go . <p> Randroid <p>  it is rumored to be released after Nintendo 's next mobile title Animal Crossing .

@@18469598 <h> Leak of Seahawks ' sudden interest in Kaepernick sparks some cynicism <p> Posted by Mike Florio on May 16 , 2017 , 10:03 AM EDT <p> Getty Images <p> On Monday , Seahawks coach Pete Carroll mused publicly about the possibility of signing quarterbacks Colin Kaepernick of Robert Griffin III . Then came the report from NFL Media that the Seahawks had recently reached out to Kaepernick 's agent about a possible backup job . <p> One league source with knowledge of Kaepernick 's situation posed this queston to PFT in response to the news :  When do teams publicize that they 're interested in a player who is available for other teams to sign as well ?  <p> The answer may be this : The NFL wants it out there that someone/anyone is talking to Kaepernick about a job . <p> In recent days , questions have intensified regarding Kaepernick 's ongoing unemployment . With weeks of flawed assumptions and false narratives regarding Kaepernick 's demands , abilities , and objectives , no one had actually gone to the source to acquire the information necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word emerging that the Seahawks have spoken to Kaepernick about being a backup , the glaring failure of anyone to reach out to Kaepernick has now been addressed . <p> The real question is whether the Seahawks will offer Kaepernick a job , and if so under what terms . If the Seahawks are indeed interested in signing him , it 's a change from late March , when Pete Carroll sounded lukewarm about Kaepernick at best . <p>  Well , we 'll see ,  Carroll told PFT Live at the league meetings in Arizona .  We 'll see about the quarterback position . Colin has been an effective player , and he 's had some ups and downs in his playing career . I hope he finds a spot . I do n't know if it 's going to be with us .  <p> So the real questions now become : ( 1 ) whether the Seahawks ' interest in Kaepernick is legitimate ; ( 2 ) if so , whether they will offer him a job ; ( 3 ) if so , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they make it publicly known that they 're making a move on signing Kaepernick as a backup given that other teams could be inclined to jump into the fray ? <p> Sounds like Pete is trying to artificially drive up demand for has-been commodity . <p> wayne1693 says:May 16 , 2017 10:12 AM <p> Let 's get REAL : You do n't mind all the headaches &amp; weirdness -- the NFL has plenty of that -- if there is better than a 50/50 chance the Player is gon na have a positive impact on the Field .

The difference is , the teams who would take a chance on him like the Cowboys and Bengals are not in need of a QB .

No conspiracy required . <p> For whatever anybody says about kap being a has been , I 'll say he 's probably better than anybody the bears , jets , browns have to play quarterback .

He initiates things then blames people when they do n't work out ? He gets people to call GMs and head coaches liars . Must be nice to have that stroke . Kaepernick is n't a pro style QB .

After pressure from the business community and LGBT advocates , Pence signed into law a fix to the measure . <p> That same year , Pence ordered state agencies to halt resettlement for Syrian refugees after terrorist attacks in Europe .

We 're making sure Mike Pence knows we have our eye on him , and we 've been following him for a long time .  <p>  Vice President Pence has a right to speak anywhere he 's invited , it 's not a question of any of that ,  said Hegedus .

Apodaca said Thursday . <p> Asked for comment on the lawsuit , the university issued a statement that said :  Cal State San Marcos is committed to fostering a campus environment where diverse ideas and views can be presented and discussed . In addition , we take student complaints and concerns very seriously .  <p> Student activities fees , which this semester were $50 and will rise to $75 this fall , are mandatory for every student at the San Marcos campus .

His firm filed the case on behalf of Students for Life . <p>  It 's really outrageous for any university to force students to pay for viewpoints that they agree with , while denying support for opposing points of view ,  Langhofer said . <p> Will Creeley , senior vice president of legal and public advocacy for the Foundation for Rights in Individual Education -- a nonprofit aimed at defending civil liberties in academia -- said the case will come down to whether the university is applying the same standard to all groups . <p>  The Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities funds to be disbursed , they have to be disbursed in a viewpoint-neutral way ,  said  They ca n't pick and chose who gets funds based on the viewpoint of the group .  <p> Creeley said the plaintiffs will have to show evidence of a double standard or that the decision to deny funding was motivated by the viewpoint . However , if there is an objective , content-neutral rule that justifies the decision to deny funding , the plaintiffs  will have an uphill climb .  <p> He said , ironically , similar campus speech cases from 30 years ago  involved LGBT groups that were denied funding and recognition .  <p> This school year , the Associated Students ' operating budget at CSUSM was nearly $1.4 million . Of that , $296,000 went to support the two centers and all of their programming -- more than 21 percent of the operating budget . <p> The student government also funds the student groups through its leadership fund , up to $500 a semester for approved uses .

18522966," In this early novel from Japan 's master surrealist , Abe ( The Box Man ) casts a young man 's journey home as an agonizing exploration of the depths of human suffering . Three years after the surrender of Japan in World War II , Kyuzo escapes from his hometown in Manchuria amidst the Chinese Civil War . He yearns for his ancestral homeland of Japan , a place he has only ever  imagined from his textbooks .  His train is derailed in the fighting , and he is led away from the wreckage on a treacherous march through the countryside by a man named Ko . They are soon lost in the  endless repetition of stones , ditches , withered grasses , and swelling hills  and only survive due to  a beastlike visceral impulse .  The bulk of the novel is taken up by this journey , its every trial chronicled with riveting ferocity by Abe . Kyuzo wonders ,  Could anyone promise that human beings were less cruel than nature ?  This novel is an excellent entry point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone and style . He is a master of controlling the reader 's emotional investment while crafting an increasingly suffocating atmosphere of dread , resulting in a devastating reading experience . <p> Elizabethtown College historian Brown ( Richard Hofstadter : An Intellectual Biography ) writes a tight , finely observed character study of F. Scott Fitzgerald ( 1896 -- 1940 ) , one of America 's most cherished authors . Though remembered as an epicurean and chronicler of the Roaring Twenties , Fitzgerald was , in Brown 's view , a nostalgic moralist with a broad historical imagination . Like Frederick Jackson Turner , Sigmund Freud , and T. S. Eliot , he was an avid observer and critic of the modern age . Brown draws the figure of a sentimental romantic , perplexed by the collapse of pre-WWI taboos , who idealized a declining Anglo-Saxon elite to which he did not belong . Fitzgerald 's early success with This Side of Paradise made him a literary superstar . An erratic private life of high living in Europe and country houses followed , complicated by his mentally unstable wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hollywood , an affair with gossip columnist Sheilah Graham , and an early heart attack . Brown deftly explores the great uncertainties of social class in Fitzgerald 's day and the outsider feelings that clouded his life and psyche . Making sense of his time-bound views of African Americans and women proves more of a challenge . Carefully researched and a pleasure to read , Brown 's persuasive , original account will entice Fitzgerald fans and cultural historians alike . <p> Dinerstein ( Swinging the Machine ) traces the trajectory of the notion of American cool through the cultural milieu of the 1920s through the early 1960s , emphasizing its deep associations with jazz culture .  Keeping cool  originally served as a survival tactic against the many injustices of the Jim Crow era , and it found triumphant voices in the improvisations of jazz heroes like Lester Young and Billie Holiday who refused to cater to the expectations of white audiences . Dinerstein deftly reveals points of convergence between expressions of cool in jazz , film noir , and existentialist literature ; each rejected societal constructs perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law ) and celebrated the  ethical rebel ,  always a rugged loner . In the 1950s , this rebel ethic shifted focus , emphasizing instead rebellion against what was perceived as vacuous material culture and consumer society , a sentiment lucidly expressed in Kerouac 's On the Road . Stars like Frank Sinatra ( who headlined events for Martin Luther King Jr . and refused to patronize white-only establishments ) gave substance to the celluloid rebels of the noir-era , becoming real-life rebels against racial injustice . Impressively researched and broad in its reach , drawing from film , music , theater , philosophy , and literature , this book approaches the subject with scholarly authority while remaining eminently readable . Much more than just a history of cool , this book is a studied examination of the very real , often problematic social issues that popular culture responds to . <p> Djian 's slim , disturbing novel , already a controversial bestseller in France , is unsparing and fiercely intelligent . The book begins with narrator Mich ? le on her living room floor after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  nearing fifty , fiercely independent and unsentimental ,  reacts to this assault in the same way that she meets most of the demands of her life : with incisive wit , brutal honesty , and an almost unnerving composure . In spite of the attack , she continues to manage a demanding career , financial responsibility for her son and her mother , and an affair with her best friend 's husband . However , Mich ? le 's assailant does not disappear . He breaks into her home while she is away ; he taunts her with lewd and threatening messages . As Mich ? le tries to discover who her attacker is , readers come to learn of her family 's violent past and understand how this history shapes her present and how the present circumstances reshape her history . Djian 's bold novel , winner of the 2012 Prix Interalli ? and adapted into an award-winning film directed by Paul Verhoeven , is slight but packs a powerful punch . <p> Instead of enjoying her senior year of high school in Ohio , Caroline Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not super-stable and the fear of terrorism is real ,  so her mother can fulfill a dream of opening an eye clinic in  Garbage City ,  home to Cairo 's most impoverished inhabitants . A practicing Catholic , Caroline is eager to learn about Islam and Egyptian culture , but she struggles to adjust to the crowded urban environment , the mosque 's predawn calls to prayer , the fact that she needs a driver to take her around the city , and frequent sexual harassment . A growing friendship with her driver 's teenage children , Adam and Aya , helps her acclimate , and things look up when she discovers that her crush on Adam is mutual . With humor , sensitivity , and empathy , Doller ( The Devil You Know ) conveys the complexities of an interfaith , intercultural romance : the blatant disapproval from Adam 's family and friends , her parents ' worry (  The kind thing to do would be to leave him alone  ) , and Adam 's own doubts . It 's a tender story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Readers do n't need to be fashionistas to appreciate the dilemmas of Charlene  Charlie  Dean and John Thomas-Smith as they prepare for a garment design competition , hoping to win a scholarship to a prestigious fine arts high school . Charlie knows just about everything there is to know about fashion design ; immersing herself in it is a welcome escape from life with a drug-addicted father and his string of sketchy girlfriends . John , a classmate , could n't care less about the clothes , but is desperate to get into the school , and the contest is his last chance . As the rivals furiously brainstorm ideas , search for models , betray friends , and misplace their priorities in a race to win , they undergo significant changes that profoundly alter their outlooks . Charlie and John 's voices ring clear in a series of fashion diary entries ( a requirement of the contest ) , reflecting their personalities , attitudes , and inner conflicts . Filled with hilarious and tragic moments alike , Juby 's ( The Truth Commission ) vibrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two very different teens . Ages 12 -- up . <p> In this haunting hybrid of memoir and true crime account , Marzano-Lesnevich describes how a law school internship set her on a collision course with Ricky Langley , a pedophile and murderer , forcing her to contend with past trauma and preexisting prejudice . Langley was sentenced to death for the 1992 murder of six-year-old Jeremy Guillory , a sentence that was overturned after a surprising request for leniency by the victim 's mother . In an impeccably researched account , Marzano-Lesnevich explores Langley 's childhood , his repeated efforts to get help , suicide attempts , and a prior prison sentence , during which he told a therapist ,  ' Do n't let me out of here . '  The author draws parallels to her own history of sexual abuse and the family members who failed to confront her abuser , and she recounts her later battles with an eating disorder and PTSD . Marzano-Lesnevich excels at painting an atmospheric portrait : a staircase becomes an ominous symbol , and a house 's peeling paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked underneath .  The dual narratives are infinitely layered , as Marzano-Lesnevich allows for each person 's motivations and burdens to unspool through the pages . Her writing is remarkably evocative and taut with suspense , with a level of nuance that sets this effort apart from other true crime accounts . <p> The Jamaican novelist and poet Miller ( The Last Warner Woman ) presents a rueful portrait of the enduring struggle between those who reject an impoverished life on his native island and the forces that hold them in check , what the rastafari call Babylon . The year is 1982 , and a teacher cuts the dreadlocks off a child named Kaia because he looks  like some dirty little African .  Ma Taffy , Kaia 's aunt , comforts him with the story of Bedward , an Augustown preacher and forerunner of the rastafari . Sixty years earlier , Bedward 's miraculous attempt  ' to rise up into de skies like Elijah '  was halted by the  Babylon boys  pulling him down  with a long hooker stick .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the principal of the school has been tutoring her , and after the local college accepts her application ,  a certain lightness of being  takes her over ,  as if she could close her eyes right now and begin to rise .  After seeing Kaia 's bald head , though , she is instead forced into a confrontation with Babylon . In the end , there is no avoiding  the stone  Ma Taffy describes the poor people of Augustown being born with ,  the one that always stop we from rising .  The flashback is telling of Miller 's talent for infusing his lyrical descriptions of the island 's present with the weight of its history . <p> In this outstanding standalone , set in late-1950s Glasgow , from Edgar-finalist Mina ( Blood , Salt , Water ) , William Watt stands accused of butchering his wife , daughter , and sister-in-law , but he vehemently proclaims his innocence . Only ace attorney Laurence Dowdall saves him from prison , but public sentiment is against him , forcing Watt to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meets Peter Manuel , career criminal , convicted burglar , suspected rapist . The two form a strange alliance after Manuel promises to show Watt where the murder weapon is hidden -- but for a price . With knifelike precision , Mina flicks between the bizarre 12 hours Watt and Manuel spend together getting drunk in Glasgow bars , and Manuel 's later trial , where 's he 's on the dock not only for the murder of the Watt family but also the slaughter of another trio , asleep in their beds . The question of guilt or innocence is irrelevant , and the gray of the in-between reigns supreme . And while Mina 's usual tough female protagonists are absent , the presence of women presses as near as the crush of bodies eager to attend Manuel 's trial . <p> This remarkable book does much more than offer a gripping reconstruction of the 1737 trial of Joseph Suss Oppenheimer , who had been the personal banker and advisor of the duke of a small German state and was executed , after the duke 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would already have been a significant achievement , as the rigorous attention to detail and nuance bring the case vividly to life . But Mintzker , a history professor at Princeton , also explains the challenges presented to a historian in ascertaining the truth about the trial , and the rationale behind his way of dealing with the evidentiary record . He articulates , cogently and with a refreshing lack of academic terminology ,  a general methodology to help deal with common historical dilemmas in which the contradictions in the sources seem frustratingly irreconcilable .  He combines direct quotes from the available sources , critical analysis , and efforts to  get beyond what the sources describe  by examining the context of their creation . The sections analyzing the trial from the perspectives of four men -- including a judge-inquisitor -- allow Mintzker to illustrate the merits , and logic , of his approach . This fascinating intellectual journey deserves a wide audience outside the academic scope of the book . <p> Philbrick draws on an episode recounted in his 2013 adult work , Bunker Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one-to-two page chapters , interspersed with Minor 's luxuriant gouache and watercolor illustrations , Philbrick skillfully summarizes the events leading up to that encounter -- including the Boston Tea Party and ensuing British occupation of Boston -- and effectively contrasts printer Isaiah Thomas 's patriotic fervor with Ben 's boyish preoccupations . Ben and his schoolmates excitedly follow British soldiers to Lexington and Concord but find themselves trapped outside Boston after the British seal off access to the city . For more than two months , separated from his family , Ben delivered food for General Israel Putnam 's wing of the nascent provincial army . Philbrick recreates the tension of the hard-fought Battle of Bunker Hill , as seen through Ben 's eyes , and provides a satisfying reunion with his family . The concluding chapters of this succinct , dramatic narrative tell of Ben 's work as an apprentice to Isaiah in Worcester , where he discovered his future profession as a newspaper publisher .

18525689," Events <h> TV Schedule <h> Rockies Lose Game 2 Of Doubleheader With Twins <p> MINNEAPOLIS ( The Sports Xchange ) -- Coming up through the Minnesota Twins ' system , Jose Berrios gained plenty of accolades and caused anxiety for the organization and its fans waiting for the right-hander to show his tantalizing mix of pitches at the major league level . <p> Berrios ' first start of the season , last Saturday at Cleveland , finally displayed the talent he possesses and confirmed the recognition that he received as a minor-leaguer . <p> Thursday 's follow-up was even better and had the Colorado Rockies heaping more praise on the young Puerto Rican . <p> Berrios ( 2-0 ) dazzled with a career-high 11 strikeouts and gave up just two hits in 7 2/3 innings as the Twins earned a 2-0 win over Colorado in Game 2 of a doubleheader . <p>  It looked a lot like ( late Miami Marlins right-hander ) Jose Fernandez , to be honest . Explosive , quick heater , that sweeping curveball that he can turn into a slider ,  Rockies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes you got to tip your cap , and I have no shame in doing that today . He pitched really well .  <p> Max Kepler and Robbie Grossman each had two hits and an RBI for Minnesota , which salvaged the second game after a 5-1 loss earlier in the day . Brandon Kintzler allowed a single and a walk in the ninth but closed out his 11th save in 12 chances for the Twins . <p> Rockies starter Tyler Chatwood ( 3-6 ) walked a season-high five batters and surrendered five hits and two runs in five innings . <p>  I think with Tyler , again his stuff was outstanding ,  Colorado manager Bud Black said .  The fastball had velocity . It just looked mechanically just a little bit out of sync as far as maybe coming down the mound a little bit .  <p> Nolan Arenado homered , and German Marquez ( 2-2 ) pitched five innings and allowed one run for the Rockies in the first game . Mark Reynolds added a two-run single as Colorado tied for second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . <p> Ervin Santana ( 6-2 ) took the loss in the opener for Minnesota , allowing five runs in seven innings . <p> Long considered the top pitching prospect for a team desperate for help on the mound , Berrios struggled in a 14-game debut last season as he dealt with control problems . <p> Berrios looked strong in spring training but did n't break camp with the Twins after the World Baseball Classic interrupted his spring work . He was recalled to fill an open rotation spot for Minnesota and beat Cleveland by pitching 7 2/3 innings with one run allowed on May 7 . <p> On Thursday , Berrios held the Rockies hitless through four innings while walking one batter . <p>  He backed up the last one ; might even have been a touch better ,  said Twins manager Paul Molitor , who was booed by the hometown crowd as he went to pull Berrios in the eighth inning with 106 pitches .  I just think it was maybe a touch more dominant . But all the things that we 've asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him find success at this level , he 's been trying to address and it 's been showing up so far in his first couple of starts .  <p> Berrios controlled his fastball and displayed a devastating slider to keep Colorado off-balance . He struck out seven of the first 13 batters . Berrios hit two batters in the first two innings but stranded each with strikeouts . Gerardo Parra had Colorado 's first hit to lead off the fifth but was caught stealing . <p>  The work I put in in the offseason and during spring training and be able to be ahead of the hitters gives me the confidence ,  Berrios said .  I can tell you guys that I 'm 100 percent compared to last year in my confidence . I did n't have that last year .  <p> Kepler singled to center in the first to drive in Grossman , and Grossman plated Ehire Adrianza with a single in the fourth . <p> Chatwood struggled with command throughout but was able to hold Minnesota in check . <p>  I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to strand guys ,  Chatwood said .  Today , I was able to strand guys even though I walked them .  <p> NOTES : RHP Jose Berrios ' 11 strikeouts were the most by a Twins pitcher since Ervin Santana had 10 against the Kansas City Royals on Aug. 21 , 2016 . ... Colorado manager Bud Black said SS Trevor Story ( left shoulder strain ) would start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque on Friday . Story has hit with the team and fielded ground balls to test his non-throwing shoulder and had no issues . ... Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said LHP Adalberto Mejia would be recalled to fill the open spot in the team 's rotation and start on Saturday . Mejia started the season with the Twins , going 0-1 with a 5.79 ERA in three starts as a rookie . ... Wednesday 's rainout was the fourth this season for Minnesota and the second at home . The Twins have played the fewest games in the majors . ... The Rockies travel to Cincinnati for a weekend series against the Reds . Minnesota hosts Kansas City . 
@@18525690 <p> Planned Parenthood affiliates announced the closures of 10 health centers across the Midwest and Southwest this week , citing a variety of reasons including political attacks by antiabortion lawmakers . <p> Planned Parenthood of the Heartland said it planned to close four clinics across Iowa because of the recent budget signed into law by Gov . Terry Branstad , who pledged to  defund  the women 's health organization . <p> Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains announced it would close six clinics in Wyoming , Colorado and New Mexico as an efficiency measure largely unrelated to the political climate . One contributing factor was the health care law enacted under former president Barack Obama , which caused many existing clients who previously paid for their care out-of-pocket to qualify for Medicaid , which offers a lower reimbursement rate , officials said . Another was a desire to consolidate services in a new facility the organization plans to build in New Mexico . <p> Concern about political attacks did play a role , said Whitney Phillips , a spokeswoman for the affiliate , who said the goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way .  <p> The decision removes Planned Parenthood 's presence entirely from Wyoming , which becomes the second state after North Dakota to have no Planned Parenthood centers . The organization concluded that other clinics could handle the 500 patients served by its health center in Casper , Phillips said . She added that the organization plans to continue to have a political and educational role in the state . <p> The closures come at a pivotal time for Planned Parenthood , a 100-year-old nonprofit that provides birth control , testing for sexually transmitted diseases , cancer screenings and other services at hundreds of clinics around the country . It is facing attacks at both the state and federal level over its role as the nation 's largest abortion provider and a prominent proponent for abortion rights . <p> Congressional Republicans are seeking to cut Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid , the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled , with the House earlier this month passing a health-care bill that would do just that . Republican-led states also have sought to block taxpayer money from supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to push back against the measures , arguing they could lead to gutting services for the millions of people who rely on the organization for their health care . <p> By law , federal funds can not be used to pay directly for abortions except in narrow circumstances . But antiabortion activists say taxpayer money should not support Planned Parenthood 's non-abortion work . <p> In Iowa , an appropriations bill Branstad ( R ) signed last week ends a program that used mostly federal dollars to provide family planning services to low-income women . Branstad has said it will be replaced by a state-funded program that will direct funds to organizations that do not provide abortions . It follows a similar move by Texas four years ago . <p> Planned Parenthood officials say it will force the closure of clinics in Sioux City , Burlington and Keokuk , which will shutter June 30 , as well as one health center in Quad Cities , which will continue to provide abortions until the building is sold . The closures will affect 14,676 patients , many of whom live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control , the organization says . <p> In three of the four Iowa counties where clinics are shuttering , Planned Parenthood served 80 percent or more of the women who received birth control at a publicly funded health center , officials said . In the case of Keokuk , women in that community will have to drive nearly an hour to find the closest provider of safety-net family planning services , they said . <p>  We will do everything we can to continue to care for as many patients as we can ,  Suzanna de Baca , president of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland , said in a statement .  However , the harsh reality is that , despite all our efforts , there will be women who fall through the cracks and lose access to health care because of this dangerous legislation .  <p> Antiabortion groups celebrated the news that the Iowa clinics would shutter and suggested that other health centers could absorb the patients . <p>  This is good news for families in the state of Iowa ,  Maggie DeWitte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  There are many quality community health centers in Iowa that provide comprehensive health care to women and families across the state .

She goes to work , hangs out with friends and comes home to crank up something interesting on Netflix or Hulu . <p> Every now and again , however , Burke leaves Greenville for a little excitement , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Formation tour . <p>  It was the best night of my life , seriously ,  she says .  And I thought her pregnancy photos were beautiful . She would have twins . She 's just so ... perfect .  <p> ( Yes , Burke 's a member of the Beyhive , the music icon 's most devoted fan base . ) <p> When she 's not jamming to all things Bey , Bruno Mars and Jason Derulo get her dancing . She does admit , though , that country music has lately found its way onto her playlist . <p>  I just started hearing the same songs over and over on the radio ,  she says , noting a newfound love of crooner Thomas Rhett . <p> But on Thursday nights , the music is off , the phones are silenced and the TV -- yes , Burke has cable -- is tuned to her go-to scripted drama ,  Grey 's Anatomy .  <p>  I have to be home at 8 p.m. to watch every Thursday , and though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the sexual tension and the romance mixed with the medicine action and good , sweet story lines ,  she says . <p> As for other scripted shows , she notes  Private Practice ,   The West Wing ,   Friends  and  Gilmore Girls  as standouts -- most of which she gets via streaming services . Her cable subscription is also put to good use on the reality shows she loves , such as  The Bachelor  and  The Bachelorette ,   The Real Housewives  ( Orange County , Beverly Hills and Atlanta ) and  Dancing With the Stars .  <p> It 's best when they 're not trying to be as trendy and cutting edge . <p> -- Katie Burke <p> On the film front , Burke 's all-time favorite is  Forrest Gump .  In fact , anything Tom Hanks does is good with her , she says . The last movie she saw in theaters was the Emma Watson-fronted  Beauty and the Beast .  <p>  I thought it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And yet , while Burke clearly counts herself a lover of film and TV , when asked to give the industry a grade , she offers a B-minus . <p>  I think it 's best when they 're not trying to be as trendy and cutting edge ,  she says .  Sometimes they try too hard .  <p> Like NBC 's short-lived  The New Normal ,  where a gay couple allowed their surrogate and her 9-year-old daughter to move in with them . <p>  Sometimes I wonder if I live in a bubble and everyplace else there 's all these things that people might be experiencing that it relates to ,  Burke says . As an example , she mentions a 2016 episode of  Modern Family ,  one of her favorite shows to watch with her mom . Titled  A Stereotypical Day ,  it featured a trans boy as one of the new friends of a pre-teen character . <p> https : **34;212;TOOLONG ? hl=e ...  It felt like the show was trying to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  she says .  But sometimes I feel like shows feel like they have to have things like that or they 're not relevant .  <p> Burke does not identify as conservative , though she did volunteer on a Republican senator 's campaign last election cycle . When it came time to choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for president , she voted for Clinton , and says she considers herself  politically moderate .  Since Trump 's election , she admits she 's stepped away from politics and now mostly gets her news from her Facebook friends , coworkers and the infrequent alerts between commercials during  Lockup  on MSNBC . <p> Of course , Hollywood has become more expressly political in the last six months , with late-night show hosts taking on the healthcare fight and award-season red carpets brimming with banter about the government 's various antics . <p> One of the season 's most talked-about moments came with Meryl Streep 's speech at the Golden Globes in January , in which she criticized Trump for making fun of a disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean Hannity criticized Streep Burke sees a potential utility in using such a massive platform in this way . <p>  It 's tough , because as annoying as it is , they are saying things that need to be said ,  she says .  And there are a lot of people who do n't watch the news that do watch these award shows , like people in South Carolina who might be blinded to things if they only watch one news network .  <p> Even so , she says ,  it can be overshadowing the reason why I watch the awards show -- for the celebration .  And , of course , the dresses . <p> Her least favorite movie of the 2017 awards season was  La La Land .  <p>  It was overrated , and I know it 's not a popular belief ,  Burke laughs .  But the fact that it had as many award nominations as ' Titanic ' is embarrassing , because they 're not in the same class .  <p> Her favorite movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female characters and that it was based on the lives of real women who helped put men on the moon . <p> On reflection , however , Burke realizes that she did n't connect with any film last year . <p>  None of them really applied to me ,  she says .  But I 'm OK with it . That 's why I go to movies .  <p> To escape . <h> ' Let 's just be entertained .

A fourth-generation farmer , she 's known throughout Georgia and the world for her cattle and equine expertise as owner of Jones Cutting Horses in Flowery Branch .

I think that sometimes the folks in Hollywood do n't realize that though the star makes the big bucks , there are 150 other people depending on that person 's performance right down to the gentleman or lady that sweeps the floor .  <p> She notes her  excellent friend  Newt Gingrich , the former Republican presidential candidate for whom she campaigned , as an example of someone who  gets it .

Instead , she prefers  Law &amp; Order  and old James Bond movies . Her packed schedule does n't allow her time to see the latest films in theaters , but she notes ,  John Wayne was a great cowboy .  <p> News is perhaps the most consistent form of media she consumes , from a variety of sources , including newspapers , apps on her phone and Fox News .

If I felt like the last administration had gotten the same treatment , then it would n't make a difference .  <p> The incongruous treatment , she says , might have had something to do with President Obama being the first black man to hold the office . Media , she says ,  felt that some of the questions they should 've been asking were taboo . <p>  And it mattered not to me if the man was purple .

I prefer not to let it in . If you want to watch it , watch it . But I think sometimes TV does push the point , for whatever reason . I think sometimes it 's just because they can . They go unchecked , because they think they 're above the rest of us .  <p> As for the types of productions she 'd like for Hollywood to do , Jones is hoping for  something a little bit middle of the road .  <p>  They have reality that is beyond reality , and then you have the stories that push the limit ,  she says .

There 're so many liberals there , and because of it , nothing has been told from a conservative viewpoint in so long . It 's probably going to take a new generation of filmmakers before that occurs .  <p> Until then , she says , the industry 's effort to be truly universal will go unreached . <p>  They 've not achieved the universal appeal , because I do n't think when they do their research for a film , that they 're willing to understand our point of view .

@@18525733 <h> Signs of the Times <h> Share <p> Cardinal Blase J. Cupich speaks before the start of the tenth annual March for Life in Chicago . <p> This summer will mark the thirty-fifth anniversary of the installation of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as the twelfth bishop and seventh archbishop of Chicago . He served the archdiocese and the church with singular distinction , and is perhaps most remembered for his consistent-ethic-of-life approach to critical issues of the day . He was guided by three convictions : that there was a need to read the signs of the times ; that the church 's social teaching had a role not just in deciding issues , but also in shaping and defining them ; and that the church was uniquely positioned institutionally to promote the common good in society . In pressing these convictions he was revolutionary -- and so it 's no surprise that , even to this day , he has his critics . <p> But , nearly four decades after the 1983 address at Fordham University in which he introduced this framework , Bernardin deserves a fresh hearing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the signs of our times , which I will propose here , makes it clear that the church 's social teaching on solidarity , consistently applied across a full range of issues that impact our human interactions , is required . He understood that the urging of the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council to read the signs of the times required the church to be fully engaged in the world by being attentive to what was really happening in the lives of real people , the trends and forces influencing policies and public opinion . Only in this way could the church be viewed as a credible and authentic voice for speaking about human affairs . I suspect he would have liked how Pope Francis has captured that sentiment in his pithy phrase  realities are greater than ideas .  <p> Cardinal Blase J. Cupich blesses a rosary during a Thanksgiving dinner put on by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago . <p> In reading the signs of his times , Bernardin was concerned about the futility of treating issues like abortion , capital punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrete topics . He understood how these issues were divisive in themselves . But he was convinced that a comprehensive commitment to respecting life as a principle connecting these issues would benefit them all .  The purpose of proposing a consistent ethic of life ,  he said ,  is to argue that success on any one of the issues threatening life requires a concern for the broader attitude in society about respect for human life .... The viability of this principle depends upon the consistency of its application .  <p> He knew as well that the integrity of Catholic social teaching made it uniquely suited as a framework for holding these issues together under a common principle . How was it , he asked , that the Catholic bishops , virtually alone among leadership groups in American society , found themselves witnessing ardently against both abortion and the nuclear-war policies of the United States ? It was the integrity of its teaching -- that is , a consistent ethic of life , that set the church apart . As a result , Catholic social teaching would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework that governs American public life , then or now . <p> Yet this also explains the hostility to the consistent-ethic-of-life approach . It asserts that the integrity of Catholic social teaching can not be contoured to political divides . It asserts that Catholics are called to allegiance to their faith before allegiance to their partisan worldview . And it asserts that the integrity of Catholic teaching must not be undermined by diminishing the importance of key social teachings in political life , even to advance important political goals . <p> Cardinal Bernardin was also convinced that the church 's social-policy role had to go beyond deciding key questions in the public debate , arguing it was just as important for the church to take the lead in defining such questions . This is how he put it in observing what was accomplished that same year by the bishops ' pastoral letter The Challenge of Peace : God 's Promise and Our Response :  The impact of the pastoral was due in part to its specific positions and conclusions , but it was also due to the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , it shaped the debate going forward , which was also his intention in proposing a consistent ethic of life . Our Catholic faith , accompanied by our long intellectual tradition , he argued , is uniquely able to assist our society in framing the moral calculi we , as a nation , are called to make , to define the terms and the values that should shape our public-policy discussions and decisions , to offer the moral and human vocabulary that is so often lacking in the technocratic paradigms dominant in our culture . <p> The final principle that guided him was that the church should recognize that it is well positioned as an institution to implement a reshaping of public policy . Our worship , pastoral life , ministries of health care , and education all provide a platform of lived experience where the integrity of Catholic social teaching is on display . In fact , he readily admitted in his Fordham address that he intentionally chose a Catholic university to introduce his consistent-ethic-of-life approach to church teaching , appreciative of the fact that a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a community and institution committed to the examination and testing of ideas , a Catholic university does more than repeat and summarize those ideas . Rather , he noted , universities have the noble vocation of determining the impact of new ideas and reflecting on the possibilities for development latent in them . <p> In fact , I am convinced that the legacy of the cardinal 's contribution has been enhanced over the years as Catholic universities live up to his challenging vision . Consider how his words and example have had a continuing impact : <p> 1 . There is more awareness of the role of conscience in public life , and the moral dimensions of issues of life and death , war and peace , and who moves ahead and who is left behind in economic life . <p> 2 . The substance and language of the consistent ethic of life are in many ways reflected in Catholic teaching , including the U.S. bishops ' statements on faithful citizenship and Pope Francis 's powerful metaphor of a  throw-away culture .  <p> 3 . Decades after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and increasingly young pro-life movement is challenging the violence of abortion and offering life-giving alternatives to abortion to women and children . <p> 4 . The use of the death penalty is diminishing as prosecutors , juries , and Catholic and other Americans make the case that you can not teach that killing is wrong by killing . <p> 5 . The church and other moral voices in public life increasingly reflect Cardinal Bernardin 's efforts to engage and persuade , not simply to proclaim and judge on issues of life and death , justice and peace . <p> 6 . Catholic social teaching , which was often a centerpiece of Cardinal Bernardin 's legacy , is increasingly seen as a central part of Catholic life , guiding the church 's participation in public life . <p> 7 . There is increased understanding of the connections between issues of human life and human dignity ( among young people in particular ) , care for  the least of these  and care for creation , the pursuit of justice and respect for others . <p> Cardinal Bernardin 's call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across political , ideological , and ecclesial lines is reflected in the best of Catholic and interfaith witness and advocacy . In short , many life issues formerly treated in isolation and considered unrelated are now discussed in the same context and within a shared moral framework . <p> Catholic social teaching would not and could not be fitted into a partisan political framework <p> What Cardinal Bernardin did in introducing his consistent ethic of life was nothing short of revolutionary , which is why he had his critics -- both within and outside the church . Some unfairly charged that his approach ended up making all life issues morally equivalent . Others suggested that the consistent ethic of life diminishes a commitment to resist abortion . He disagreed , and so do I. A full and consistent commitment to human life and dignity and to solidarity will enhance , not diminish , our defense of children and women victimized by the violence of abortion . As Pope Francis has said ,  It is not ' progressive ' to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite suffering the distortions and misunderstanding of his critics , Bernardin lived long enough to see the impact of his approach . And I suspect he smiled when he heard Saint John Paul II use the phrase a  consistent ethic of life  in an address to a group of U.S. bishops in 1993 on the meaning and purpose of human sexuality . It is also noteworthy that the Holy See used the term in addressing the United Nations on the need to safeguard the human rights of all forcibly displaced people . <p> But the best way to honor what he did is to apply in our day the three convictions that guided him . What are the signs of the times ? What can we retrieve from our Catholic social teaching to present challenges ? And how can our institutional resources be used to shape a response going forward ? <p> The world has changed a great deal over the past thirty-five years -- or for that matter , the past two . Our time is plagued by global terrorism and threatened by global warming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unchecked forces of economic exploitation and globalization , and others are left homeless or forced to migrate by wars and privation . As a result , we have become fearful of one another in a world marked by great divisions over race , ethnicity , religion , and place of origin . <p> Without oversimplifying , the challenge for us today is not only that the issues are in silos , separated one from another ; it is also that people , in their social networks and through the media they consult , are in silos , bereft of challenge or debate , isolated by differences of opinion or politics , race or social class , in a way that obscures our shared humanity and the ties that historically have united us as a nation of immigrants . It is not too strong to say that this sense of disconnectedness is being legitimized not only by voices in the streets , but also by those in the halls of governance here and around the world , giving rise to xenophobia , nationalism , populism , and racial intolerance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences that only further divide while pretending to offer as solutions distorted views of the role of the economy and politics , how we relate to other nations , and how to deal with global conflicts . <p> I am convinced that just as Cardinal Bernardin proposed that an ethic of life be consistently applied to unite all life issues , we need in our day to mine the church 's social teaching on solidarity , as a means of uniting humanity through a reawakening of our interdependence as a human family , which Pope John Paul II called for in his groundbreaking encyclical Sollicitudo rei socialis , and which Pope Francis is advocating in his writings . Solidarity needs to be applied consistently to all our human interactions , John Paul II wrote three decades ago , calling us to  see the ' other ' -- whether a person , people or nation ... as our ' neighbor , ' a ' helper ' ... a sharer , on a par with ourselves , in the banquet of life to which all are equally invited by God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need  to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs , the sacrifice of all forms of economic , military , or political imperialism , and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration . This is precisely the act proper to solidarity among individuals and nations .  <p> We should not be na ? ve about the resistance that an ethic of solidarity , consistently applied , will meet . It will make demands on how we live our personal lives , and how we view our national agenda and our role in the family of nations . But the first demand according to the Compendium of Catholic Social Teaching is that it will require  men and women of our day to cultivate a greater awareness that they are debtors of the society of which they have become a part . They are debtors because of those conditions that make human existence livable , and because of the indivisible and indispensable legacy constituted by culture , scientific and technical knowledge , material and immaterial goods , and by all that the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recognized in the various forms of social interaction ,  the compendium continues ,  so that humanity 's journey will not be interrupted but remain open to present and future generations , all of them called together to share the same gift in solidarity .  <p> Solidarity produces the kind of social-market economy that John Paul II advocated <p> Let me now offer some examples of what an ethic of solidarity consistently applied to the range of issues of our day looks like . The principle of solidarity would critique a narrow approach to the economy that uses a one-dimensional measure of the economic growth of a nation , singularly defined by profits , that promotes policies that maximize the freedom of markets and individual choice , and that believes that market forces left to themselves are the best -- indeed , the only -- arbiters of economic progress . This narrow approach has produced  an economy that kills ,  as Pope Francis has said . In its place , a consistent ethic of solidarity would argue that inclusion and economic security for all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision-making . Solidarity produces the kind of social-market economy that John Paul II advocated , which involves , as Pope Francis noted , passing from a liquid economy  directed at revenue profiting from speculation and lending at interest , to a social economy that invests in persons creating jobs and providing training .  <p> Solidarity also challenges a transactional approach to international relations . I have already quoted from John Paul II 's Sollicitudo rei socialis , which called world leaders to recognize the interdependence of all members of the human family and to promote a solidarity that serves peace and human development and unites rich and poor in a relationship that lifts up the most vulnerable . <p> John Paul II also wrote in that encyclical that it would be a desertion of a nation 's moral obligation for it to care only for its own well-being :  If a nation were to succumb more or less deliberately to the temptation to close in upon itself and failed to meet the responsibilities following from its superior position in the community of nations , it would fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words have much to say to us in the present climate , on a number of levels . Today , the lines between nationalism and patriotism seem to be blurred . San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy reminded us in his talk at the Erroneous Autonomy symposium this past year that our nation 's sense of being exceptional has never been a done deal ; it has always been an aspiration , a work in progress , something that we strive to live up to in each generation . Pope Francis said as much in his closing remarks to the joint session of Congress in 2015 :  A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty , as Lincoln did ; when it fosters a culture that enables people to ' dream ' of full rights for all their brothers and sisters , as Martin Luther King sought to do ; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed , as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work .  <p> John Paul II 's words about a leading nation 's moral obligation in building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calls to reignite an arms race , which from all angles will seriously reduce the capacity of our nation to address the root causes of violence in our world : social , political , and economic exclusion . <p> The question is not whether there should be military spending , but what is the needed proportion so that other ways of making us safe , secure , and whole are not neglected . Our nation already spends more on its military than any other nation on earth . It has been estimated that the world spent about $1.6 trillion on military funding in 2015 . U.S. military spending amounted to about 37 percent of this total , equaling the spending of the next seven nations with the largest military budgets -- and many of those seven are our allies . <p> At the same time , dramatic cuts are being proposed in poverty-reducing humanitarian and development assistance that helps address the root causes of conflict . Here is a small sample gleaned by staff at Catholic Relief Services , the official relief and development agency of the U.S. bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time with a record number of famines ; a 20 percent cut in development assistance that funds such priorities as basic education , democracy-building initiatives , human rights , agriculture , and employment ; a 17 percent cut in U.S. refugee admissions at a time when the number of displaced people is at its highest since World War II ; dramatic reductions in key global health programs , including a 13 percent cut in the fight against polio , a 13 percent cut in nutrition assistance , a 34 percent cut to an account for vulnerable children , a 19 percent cut for addressing tuberculosis , and many others . <p> Surveys show that if you ask the average American how much of our federal budget is spent on international assistance , they answer between 20 and 25 percent . If you ask them , how much the U.S. should spend , they say 10 percent . When they find out that non-military international aid is less than 1 percent , they are incredulous . What would it mean if funding levels actually reflected the values average Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are but a few examples of how an ethic of solidarity , consistently applied to the full range of issues that impact our human living , has the potential of reshaping the debate at a time the nation and the world are deeply divided , and vulnerable to influences that only deepen the fears at the heart of that division . An ethic of solidarity offers a language and a vision , reminding us who we are as a nation -- but also what it means to live together in this common home , as the Holy Father calls Earth in Laudato si ' . <p> Cardinal Bernardin 's consistent ethic of life has led me to once again take up the work of reading the signs of the times and pursuing a path that aspires to define the issues of the day so that the good of humanity will be served by our witness . Just as he did in his day , I now leave it up to all Catholics , and especially Catholic universities , to reflect on and develop ways to apply the church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We continue to be haunted by the threat of nuclear war and nuclear weapons . Headlines about North Korea and the ongoing debates about Iran 's nuclear ambitions highlight the continuing wisdom of the pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons . The number of abortions has gone down significantly in the United States , but the violence of abortion continues to haunt our society , and there are new pressures to require cooperation with what we believe is the taking of innocent human life . Our nation is still divided about whether decent healthcare is a human right or a commodity that depends on personal resources . In some states assisted suicide is advocated , in the knowledge that the pressures to end life will probably be more severe on the poor , the isolated , those with disabilities , and those without access to palliative care . The question of national priorities continues to haunt us as leaders advocate steep increases in military spending , renewed investment in nuclear arms , and cuts in the safety net at home and in diplomacy and development around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised if voices are raised in opposition to an ethic of solidarity , for when consistently applied , it will make demands on us all . <p> Cardinal Bernardin was convinced that the church should not shy away from her unique contribution , even if it meant standing apart from the prisms of political decision-making used by other groups , even if the integrity of our social teaching was met with hostility because it could not be made to fit into the partisan political framework that governs American public life . But , as we remain undaunted in our witness to the world , let us also take up the task before us in a way that does not confuse firmness and resolve with a lack of respect for others in the debate . It would be good to once again return to Cardinal Bernardin 's talk at Fordham , which he closed with sage advice about carrying on the debate of serious public issues with civility and mutual respect :  I suggest ,  he offered ,  a style governed by the following rule : We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our civil courtesy . We should be vigorous in stating a case and attentive in hearing another 's case ; we should test everyone 's logic but not question his or her motives .  <p> He could offer that advice because he was convinced that the church had so much more to offer the world than what could be gained by the world 's approval . Pope Francis calls us to that same sense of pride as he presses forward in building a world marked by solidarity , unafraid of how our witness will be received :  Serving means working beside the neediest of people , establishing with them first and foremost human relationships of closeness and bonds of solidarity . Solidarity , this is a word that frightens the developed world . People try to avoid saying it . Solidarity to them is almost a bad word . But it is our word .  <p> Cardinal Blase J.

Shortly after , Trump fatally undercut McMaster 's ironclad denials by confirming the main thrust of the Washington Post 's spy scoop on Twitter . <p> Echoing scores of other instant analysis pundits , Dershowitz also took to Twitter to decry Trump 's reckless actions .  This is the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president . Let 's not minimize it .

That is until Dershowitz and company dumped that test into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , Trump 's loyal Republican lemmings in Congress batted away Dershowitz 's hyperbole like a pesky mosquito , claiming the president can declassify and share intelligencewhenever he wants to , and with whomever he wants .

To his surprise , the President just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comey related and indeed , he regarded the call as weird for how substanceless it was . What bothered Comey was twofold -- the fact that the conversation happened at all ( why was Trump calling him to exchange pleasantries ? ) and the fact that there was an undercurrent of Trump 's trying to get him to kiss the ring .  <p> As a general observation , Wittes notes thatComey was  preoccupied  throughout this period with the need to protect the FBI from inquiries on investigative matters from the White House :  While I do not know how many incidents we 're talking about , how severe they were , or their particular character , I do know this : Comey understood Trump 's people as having neither knowledge of nor respect for the independence of the law enforcement function . And he saw it as an ongoing task on his part to protect the rest of the Bureau from improper contacts and interferences from a group of people he did not regard as honorable . This was a general preoccupation of Comey 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't forget as these shoes continue to drop : Comey is a Republican . <p> -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein indicated to Senate lawmakers during a classified briefing that , contrary to the White House 's version of events , he knew Comey would be fired before he wrote the memo that was used as justification for the dismissal . <p> Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) said his takeaway from Rosenstein 's briefing is that the focus of the FBI 's investigation has shifted :  It was a counterintelligence investigation until now . It seems to me now to be considered a criminal investigation .  <p> Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) said Rosenstein refused to answer  completely appropriate  questions asked by his colleagues , our colleagues report . But several Republicans asked Rosenstein if the Intelligence Committee could continue its work now that Mueller is conducting his investigation , and Rosenstein was  unequivocal  that the panel can and should continue its investigation , according to one attendee . <p> -- During the session , Rosenstein faced especially aggressive questions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Sessions was involved in Comey 's firing when he had recused himself and what his role is in selecting a new FBI director . Ed O'Keefe has some buzzy inside details :  Kirsten Gillibrandand Al Franken especially grilled Rosenstein on Sessions 's role and the scope of Mueller 's new investigation ... Another aide familiar with the exchange described Franken as ' heated . ' But one of the senators asked to recount the meeting said that Franken and Gillibrand were ' passionate ' -- not rude . Rosensteinconfirmed that Mueller 's investigation will have a broad scope -- encouraging news to Democrats especially eager for an investigation to cover all potential angles . Because of the wide berth , Rosenstein referred several of the senators ' questions to Mueller , which caused much of the frustration in the room .  <p> -- On Capitol Hill , the race is on to see who can land Comey 's first public appearance . Paul Kane reports :  Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee , operating the highest-profile investigation of Russian interference , are trying to reschedule a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private Tuesday . On Wednesday , the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a formal request for Comey to come before the panel ... And not to be outdone , House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz ... announced on Twitter that he had scheduled a hearing for Comey next week -- before he had made contact with the former FBI director .  Every panel believes Comey should still testify even with Muller in place :  Lawmakers can barely hide their ambition at landing what would be a grand media spectacle . It 's a lot like Barbara Walters and other TV personalities fighting over the first interview with a Hollywood starlet beset by scandal .  <p> -- Trump has expressed hope that Michael Flynn could rejoin the administration in some capacity after the FBI investigation concludes , The Daily Beast reports :  The president 's continued loyalty to his ousted former aide is so strong , in fact , that the two have remained in touch despite the potential that their communication could be portrayed as White House interference in a federal investigation . ' He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a friend of the retired Army general . ' He did n't want to be in the government . He wanted to go back to private life . But Trump insisted on it . ' Flynn was ' reluctant but honored ' when offered the post , according to a senior Trump administration official , and only accepted it at the president 's urging . ... Several sources said Trump has expressed his hopes that a resolution of the FBI 's investigation in Flynn 's favor might allow Flynn to rejoin the White House ... a scenario some of Trump 's closest advisers in and outside the West Wing have assured him absolutely should not happen . ' Trump feels really , really , really bad about firing him , and he genuinely thinks if the investigation is over Flynn can come back , ' said one White House official . One former FBI official and a second government official said Trump thought he owed Flynn for how things ended up and was determined to clear Flynn 's name and bring him back to the White House .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message from Trump : ' STAY STRONG , '  by Yahoo News ' Michael Isikoff :  Saddled with steep legal bills , Flynn wanted to reconnect with old friends and talk about potential future business opportunities . ... ' I just got a message from the president to stay strong , ' Flynn said after the dinner was over , according to two sources who are close to Flynn and are familiar with the conversation , which took place on April 25 .  <p> -- Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said Flynn has not responded to a subpoena from his panel in its ongoing Russia investigation , which was issued last week after he refused to cooperate with an April 28 request for documents . The AP reports :  Legal experts say it 's unlikely Flynn would agree to turn over the personal documents because he would be waiving his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by doing so . Flynn , though his lawyer , had earlier asked for immunity from ' unfair prosecution ' in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with the committee .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INVESTIGATION : <p> -- Trump convened his legal team yesterday for a strategy session . Politico 's Alex Isenstadt and Josh Dawsey report :  One White House official said the discussion ... centered around the nuts and bolts of how the investigation would work - and how the administration will need to handle the inquiry . Among those in attendance was longtime Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen , who came down from New York to attend . White House Counsel Don McGahn and his team are urging the White House - and Trump - to be cautious in its comments with a special prosecutor involved . McGahn has begun explaining to aides in detail about records retention and potential requests , two people familiar with the conversations say . One objective : to keep Trump from hurting himself any further . Two senior administration officials said they believed Trump 's letter firing Comey was a mistake . Some aides have begun reaching out to lawyers to see if they need ( their own ) counsel .  <p> -- A longtime private attorney who represented Trump for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president really needs to hire a  tough Washington lawyer  to help navigate the special counsel investigation .  He needs a good lawyer , someone who is strong , not that he would go against the lawyer 's advice , but everybody should have a lawyer who sees things through and comes up with good advice ,  Jay Goldberg told The Post 's Michael Kranish , who adds :  Trump 's need for a private attorney is viewed as a high priority because he so far has been relying on government lawyers , including his White House counsel , who could eventually be called to testify about their private conversations with him . ... Trump 's constant tweeting about subjects under investigation ... could undermine efforts to cite executive privilege , analysts said .  <p> -- Trump has signaled that he is likely to hire a new lawyer to join his defense team , but he has not yet made a final decision . From the New York Times ' Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush :  The president is said to recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is deeply cautious in selecting people he trusts , and he adds new people to his orbit slowly . ... Some of Mr. Trump 's advisers and allies ... are pushing him to move at an accelerated pace .  <p> A DEFIANT PRESIDENT -- WHO STILL CA N'T GET HIS STORY STRAIGHT : <p> -- Trump again denied asking Comey to obstruct any FBI investigation.Ashley Parker and David Nakamura report : Asked at a new conference whether he urged Comey to ease up , the president said :  No . No .  Then he ordered the media to move on to the  next question .  Trump also repeated his claim that the decision to appoint a special counsel to look into possible collusion with Russia was  a witch hunt .   I respect the move , but the entire thing has been a witch hunt , and there is no collusion between -- certainly myself and my campaign , but I can only speak for myself and the Russians . Zero ,  Trump said .  Believe me , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comey 's account of their encounter , Trump 's comments also put him into stark opposition with Rosenstein , who appointed the special counsel and whose memo criticizing Comey was initially used as justification by the White House to explain the president 's decision to fire his FBI director . The president himself later said he had long disliked Comey and made up his mind to fire him before Rosenstein presented him with his memo ... But during the news conference , Trump contradicted both his own account and that of Rosenstein .   Director Comey was very unpopular with most people ,  Trump said .  I also got a very , very strong recommendation , as you know from Rosenstein .  <p> Even though a Trump appointee decided to name the special counsel , Trump claimed that it was actually  a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election  and  hurts our country terribly  :  It shows we 're a divided , mixed-up , not-unified country ,  he said during a lunch with television anchors at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows that we 're not together as a country . And I think it 's a very , very negative thing .  <p> Mike Pence prepares to enter the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House last week . ( Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post ) <p> WHAT DID THE VICE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT ? <p> -- Pence has begun tiptoeing much more gingerly in recent days as scandal has engulfed the White House . From the Associated Press 's Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey :  It has n't been easy , and it 's getting harder by the day . ... And there are fresh questions about how much Pence knew as head of Trump 's transition team . The vice president was under new scrutiny Thursday after reports that Flynn in January alerted the transition team about a Justice Department inquiry into whether he was secretly working as a foreign lobbyist for Turkish interests . An administration official said Thursday that Pence knew nothing about Flynn 's activities at the time and referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March in which Pence said , ' Hearing that story today was the first I heard of it . '  <p> -- Pence 's people inside the White House are apparently beginning to leak in an effort to protect the vice president . This could foreshadow a significant rupture . It appears that the ambitious Pence 's emerging strategy to save his own political future is to insist that he was out of the loop , but this is a risky play because it makes him look less powerful and it will backfire badly if a smoking gun emerges to show that he knew more than he 's let on . <p> An unnamed source close to Pence told NBC News last night that the Veep was kept totally in the dark about Flynn 's alleged wrongdoings . This person complained that it is part of a  pattern .   That 's an egregious error -- and it has to be intentional ,  the source close to Pence told NBC .  It 's either malpractice or intentional , and either are unacceptable .  Vaughn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall campaign , reports on the fuller context :  This would be the second time that Pence claims he was kept in the dark about possible Flynn wrongdoings , despite the White House 's alleged knowledge of them . Earlier this year , Pence said he was not made aware of Flynn 's discussions with Russian officials until 15 days after Trump and the White House were notified . The source ... is now saying that Pence and his team were not made aware of any investigation relating to Flynn 's work as a foreign agent for Turkey .  This Pence loyalist tried to place the blame on White House counsel McGahn for not alerting the V.P. , who was head of the transition . <p> --The last few days have taken a physical toll on Pence and he 's kept a very low public profile , per CNN 's Elizabeth Landers . He even skipped the weekly Senate GOP lunch :  Though Pence will continue to be a ' loyal soldier ' because he is a ' relentlessly positive guy , ' he ' looks tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly knew we needed to be prepared for the unconventional , ' but , the source adds , ' not to this extent . '  <p> -- Are Pence 's loyalists telling the truth ? Or are they just trying to save their boss ?  There are two possible defenses for Pence here ,  The Post 's Aaron Blake writes :  The first is that maybe McGahn did n't pass this information along to Pence . This does n't make much sense , though , given that Pence was leading the transition effort . That would be gross negligence on McGahn 's behalf . The second is that , even if Pence knew about it , perhaps he was referring strictly to the reports about Flynn having just filed as a foreign agent when he said it was the first he 'd heard of it . But that would be highly , highly misleading -- at best .  <p> Dana Rohrabacher , actor Steven Seagal and Rep.

He claims to have lost a drunken arm-wrestling match with Putin ... in the 1990s . ... The warning to Mr. Rohrabacher shows that the F.B.I . has for years viewed Russian spies , sometimes posing as diplomats , as having a hand in Washington .  This story comes a day after a story revealed that House Majority Kevin McCarthy said during a private meeting with GOP leaders last summer that Trump and Rohrabacher are being paid by the Russians . ( He now claims he was joking . ) <p> THE SPECIAL COUNSEL GETS HIS OWN DUCKS IN A ROW : <p> -- Bob Mueller will undergo a Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding his former law firm , which represents several figures who could be caught up in his probe.Matea Gold and Rosalind S. Helderman report :  DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said the agency will conduct a background investigation and detailed review of conflict-of-interest issues , a process outlined in the regulation governing special counsels under which he was appointed . For the past three years , Mueller has been a partner in the Washington office of WilmerHale , whose attorneys represent Paul Manafort , as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner . Federal regulations prohibit officials from participating in matters involving their former employers for two years after joining the government unless they receive a waiver to do so . Ethics experts said they anticipate that the Justice Department will grant a waiver , noting that Rosenstein would have taken Mueller 's past employer into consideration when selecting him .  The firm insists there Mueller has no potential conflicts and did n't work for the others . <p> Joe Lieberman walks out of the West Wing after a job interview with Trump on Wednesday .

@@18528332 <h> DREAMCAR Talks Not Being A Supergroup &amp; The Future of No Doubt <p> For No Doubt fans that have been anxiously awaiting a new record , DREAMCAR is here to satiate musical palettes . While the project is a sonic departure from what No Doubt enthusiasts are used to , it unites the iconic band 's Tony Kanal , Adrian Young and Tom Dumont with AFI 's Davey Havok . The fascinating part : the quartet was able to keep their project under the radar for the past few years -- pretty impressive for two bands who have almost one million combined Twitter fans . <p> Perhaps the reason why DREAMCAR remained under wraps was because it started out as a bit of a hobby .  It really started purely as this idea of making music for fun that we liked , and we were n't sure how it was going to all pan out initially ,  explains Dumont .  In the end , we had written over 20 songs together , and we thought , this is a band . We have an album here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result : a self-titled record that blends the musicians ' love for 80s new wave acts like Duran Duran , New Order and Pet Shop Boys , with a hint of Morrissey 's baritone weaved in . For both No Doubt members and AFI 's Havok , the music they created together was something they had never dabbled in , but the tracks came together naturally . In fact , they 're so anthemic they sound like they could soundtrack one of John Hughes ' seminal 1980s teen films . It 's something that speaks to the overall theme of the record , too .  In a sense , the album is a romantic drama as well ,  Dumont explains .  The lyrics are so much about Davey 's life and the romantic aspects of it .  <p> With the album 's release this month , we caught up with Dumont and Havok about creating a project that went beyond their fanbases , how nostalgia informed their music and how  dead girls  have taken a liking to Havok . <p> How did DREAMCAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumont : It started a couple of years ago -- Tony Kanal , Adrian Young and I wanted to see if we could keep playing music together . We thought we needed a collaborator and a singer who we can work with and Tony and Davey knew each other . We took Davey out to dinner -- on a date , kind of -- and we just talked to him about music and what he 'd have in mind . He was open to it , and of course , we knew Davey was in AFI and that 's his priority , but he had time to start writing songs with us . We started doing it as a collaboration just to see what would happen . We originally sent him four musical ideas . He wrote over those and started making demos of them . Then we wrote song after song after song in all of our free time . It really started purely as this idea of making music for fun that we liked , and we were n't sure how it was going to all pan out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 songs together , and we thought , this is a band . We have an album here . Let 's do this for real . Let 's make a record together and put it out . We recorded the album last summer , and here we are . <p> How did you guys come up with DREAMCAR for the name of the band ? It 's so ethereal . <p> Davey Havok : After many attempts of naming the band , there were many names that were taken . There are many band names that were taken . I was thrilled when we came upon DREAMCAR and found out we could use it as our band name . I really think it speaks to being idyllic , nostalgic , the unattainable or that dream you do achieve . Thereby we decided it was perfect for us . <p> There are a lot of supergroups out there right now -- BNQT , Minor Victories , Nice As Fuck , etc . What sets you guys apart from them ? <p> Davey : I think supergroups have more than members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . I think our record sets us apart from other bands . I think we think of ourselves as a band we 're happy with that makes music that we enjoy . Hopefully people will enjoy it . <p> Davey , how has DREAMCAR been different than AFI for you ? <p> Davey : It 's vastly different . Musically it 's different than anything I 've ever done before . That music not only informs how I perform and how I write , but it informed my decision to actually take part in this band with the boys because the music really touches on an aspect of my musical upbringing that I have n't touched on , so it was cool to finally do so . <p> What music inspired you guys to make DREAMCAR happen ? <p> Tom : We never talked specifically about being a specific kind of band . We made the music organically . I think a lot of it comes out of a shared love for music we grew up listening to in the 80s . I think that informed a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of us . Davey 's bands , AFI and Blaqk Audio , come from a different place than No Doubt . So , the sound of DREAMCAR is where we ended up meeting in the middle . <p> Davey : I listen to a lot of music I grew up listening to . For me , what I 'm listening to does n't inform my writing . Oftentimes I 'm not listening to anything because I 'm immersed in music all day . <p> Was there anything that made you guys go in a new wave direction ? <p> Tom : It was n't something we specifically discussed -- I think we just found it was common ground for the four of us . We wanted to make music that was fun for us that had a unique sound . I feel like that period was so influential in our musical lives . We just had a lot of fun experimenting with those textures and sounds . We did n't talk about it too much up until now . We also wanted the album to sound contemporary -- we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio now . I think we struck a good balance of doing something that was fun and inspired by the 80s and was sonically modern . <p> How did  Kill For Candy  become the lead single for the record ? <p> Tom : That was one of the first four songs that we wrote together . It just feels like it set the right tone . We 're a new band , and we think that a lot of fans of our bands have been curious to know what DREAMCAR sounds like , and it feels like that song sums it up . <p> Davey , do you have any interesting anecdotes around writing the lyrics for the record ? <p> Davey : For me , the writing process was listening to a body of music and being informed by the body of music -- writing a lyric or melody based on the music I was receiving . When I started writing  All Of The Dead Girls ,  it came from the concept of the lyric  dead girls ,  which was informed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . I wrote this whole record in his home up in the Hollywood Hills . If you read the lyrics of that song , it 's a multilayered self-aware , self-unaware dichotomy . It was n't a direct quote , but it was a comment about me and those who have an affinity for me or not . Not too many interesting stories ... I just write . <p> How did you guys keep the project under the radar ? <p> Tom : The reason why we did n't announce it or talk about it was because we did n't know what was going to become of it . We just wanted to be purely as creative as we could , which is why we kept it to ourselves for as long as we could . You 'd think that these days with social media and the internet that a rumor would get out , but we were able to keep it under the radar and write for a long time without anyone knowing about the project . <p> Davey : We spent about two years in secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , who I knew from the music industry , but who is good friends with the rest of the boys from DREAMCAR . It was at that point that he had listened to about 15-20 songs that we had made . He was very excited about it and wanted to bring us into Sony . They ended up releasing the record . <p> How do you think AFI and No Doubt fans will perceive DREAMCAR ? <p> Tom : It 's interesting , we 've been playing a bunch of shows live and it 's so interesting to see the audience reaction . It 's very clear who in the audience are AFI fans and who are No Doubt fans . So far the response is really amazing . I feel so much gratitude for the fans who are coming out to hear what we sound like . My favorite fans of all are people who came up to me over the past few weeks that said ,  No Doubt and AFI are my favorite bands . We ca n't believe it  There are some fans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate that we got together for those fans or something . One thing you realize after playing music for a number of years is that you can never please everybody . But if we can please ourselves , that 's what makes us happy . <p> Davey : I only feel like I need to make AFI music to please AFI fans . However , that being said , I 'm so touched to see that at so many DREAMCAR shows are so many AFI fans that have come this extra step to go and see a band when they did n't know what it was going to sound like . It 's hard to say what we would or would n't do in the future . We could do something very similar or very different . <p> Is there a theme that resonates within the record ? <p> Tom : To me a lot of the unifying theme comes from Davey , lyrically speaking . Davey is very different from AFI and certainly very different from No Doubt . Davey is so dramatic in the way he makes lyrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Broadway musical . And I love that about him . In a sense , it 's a romantic drama as well . The lyrics are so much about Davey 's life and the romantic aspects of it . I feel like that 's a huge theme of the album . <p> Davey : It 's not a themed record . Each song definitely stands alone . Luckily I was given the opportunity to express myself freely . The boys were very supportive of my lyrics and songwriting , which was very flattering . Each song really stands alone , but I think all of them are informed by the music I heard first . <p> Do you see DREAMCAR as a one-time album or project ? <p> Tom : We definitely do n't think of it as a one-time thing . Nobody knows what the future holds . We definitely have the same approach as we did with No Doubt . If it 's fun , and we 're getting along great , we 're going to keep doing it . With DREAMCAR , I think it 's definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 . I 'd love to see us make another album . No Doubt is always my first priority in life , so if an opportunity comes up again we 'll do that . I think it 's very possible to be in two bands at once . <p> Davey : I view DREAMCAR as something I 'm really , really passionate about . I love it . I think it 's something very important to me . <p> That brings me to my next question : what does the future of No Doubt look like ? <p> Tom : We 're on a hiatus . We 're all really happy for Gwen Stefani -- she 's doing what she loves right now , which is being on The Voice right now . She 's doing a great job . She put out a solo record and toured last year . DREAMCAR is really happening while she 's doing that stuff . I think people had a mistaken impression that No Doubt had broken up , and we never have . We 've had so much success over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own things . No Doubt is like a family -- it 's such a deep , deep friendship there . We 've always wanted Gwen to be happy , so we wanted her to be able to do what she wanted to do away from the band . That does n't mean that No Doubt is over .

Friday , May 19 , 2017 <p> Take a ride to the top of Mercedes-Benz Stadium , about 340 feet above what will become the playing field , and you see first-hand the challenge , the complexity and , yes , the marvel of the building 's retractable roof . <p> You see the eight movable panels , called petals , each weighing about 500 tons . You see the rails on which the steel petals will move in straight lines when the roof opens or closes . You see workers making adjustments and preparing the petals for installation of a translucent covering . <p> And you look down , through the roof 's 100,000-square-foot opening , and see the ground on which a Falcons exhibition game is scheduled to be played Aug. 26 , which was 100 days away as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an up-close look at the roof that has delayed the massive stadium 's opening three times and ultimately figures to be one of its signature features , an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter and photographer were lifted in a crane basket from field level to the top of the building . <p> The roof is about 180 feet above the highest row of upper-deck seats . It measures 14 acres , including the approximately 2 1/2-acre retractable portion , which currently is in the open position . And it is believed to account for hundreds of millions of dollars toward the $1.5 billion cost of the stadium . <p> Already standing on the roof when the reporter and photographer landed was Bill Darden , president of Darden &amp; Company , the project-management firm overseeing development of the stadium for Falcons and Atlanta United owner Arthur Blank . <p>  It 's just an incredibly one-of-a-kind thing ,  Darden said of the roof . <p> More than once , Blank has called it  the most complicated roof design in the history of the world .  No one on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Darden , in a 45-minute rooftop interview , compared its construction to  a Swiss watchmaker working with micro-ounce pieces that are so small you can barely even know they 're in your hand .  <p> Except , he added , for this large difference :  There are 4,000 tons of steel in these eight petals , and we 're trying to accomplish the same exact thing because these pieces have to move at the exact precise time and have to have very tight tolerances between the bogies and the rails . They ca n't be ( loose ) , like you see in an amusement park sometimes . It 's very precise . I was in a meeting earlier this week , and we were literally talking about 1/16th and 1/32nd of an inch .  <p> The eight petals -- each more than 200 feet long -- rest on the bogies , mechanisms that sit on the rails . For the roof to open or close , the bogies move the petals along eight separate tracks , which are attached to the fixed portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on a railroad track ,  Darden said . <p> Or eight railroad cars on eight tracks . <p> The roof is powered by many electric motors -- 12 motors per petal . Each petal is moved independently but in unison with the others . <p> Eventually , opening and closing the roof is supposed to be a routine process that takes nine to 12 minutes . <p>  We can move it today ,  Darden said .  But the tighter those tolerances are , the longer the life span of the bogies . So it 's important to drill down and get them right , right out of the gate .  <p> Darden said the stadium will be ready for what is now scheduled as its first event , a Falcons exhibition game against the Arizona Cardinals in late August . <p>  Like anything this complicated , it 'll be a challenge . But we 'll get it done , yeah ,  he said .  It 's exciting to see how many bodies are up here working . When these people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keeps going .  <p> Even if the Aug. 26 opening is achieved , there has been much speculation -- denied by the Falcons organization -- that the roof might not be ready to retract then and that part or all of the stadium 's first season might be played with it closed . <p>  Day 1 , I think we 'll be able to operate both ways ,  Darden said , meaning with the roof open or closed . <p> Adding to the complexity of the roof is that a 58-foot-high , 360-degree video board is being built into the structure . The steel to support the halo-shaped board has been erected , and installation of the video screens is underway . The board , shipped in more than 40 truckloads from manufacturer Daktronics ' headquarters in Brookings , S.D. , will ring the roof opening , measuring 1,100 feet around . <p> All of the stadium 's structural steel is in place now , including 18,000 tons in the fixed roof , 4,000 tons in the retractable portion , 4,000 tons in the  skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video board . <p> The final structural-steel piece was installed early this month . Attached to one of the roof petals , it is designed to cover and seal the spot where the eight triangular petals come together when the roof is closed . The construction team calls this piece the  button  because , although it weighs eight tons and measures 22 feet in diameter , it is expected to look like the button on the top of a ball cap from far overhead . <p> The completion of structural steel was cause for celebration by the workers on site . But as the calendar moves rapidly toward football season , there is still plenty of work to be done up on the roof . <p> On a recent 88-degree afternoon , a gentle breeze blew across the roof as some workers gauged alignments , made adjustments , checked water-tight seals . Others prepared for the installation of multiple layers of ETFE , a plastic-like material that will filter the sun 's rays while letting in some light when the roof is closed . <p> The roof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Next month , it 'll be moved back to the closed position for other work . <p> The stadium originally was scheduled to open March 1 , which was pushed back to June 1 , then to July 30 , then to Aug. 26 -- a total of about six months in delays , all said to be related to roof steel work . <p> Mercedes Benz Stadium Animation <p> Demolition of the Georgia Dome , originally slated for July , has been put on hold as an  insurance policy  against further delays . Steve Cannon , CEO of Falcons parent company AMB Group , said it should be known in June when preparations for demolishing the Dome can resume . <p>  You install a shim that closes a gap or addresses a gap ,  Cannon said .  So , yes , there was a shimming process that took place .  <p> On the roof , you see an example of that improvisation : a spot where an additional chunk of steel had been bolted to a petal to make an adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects wanted the roof to be a significant , even iconic , design feature rather than just a utilitarian cover . The lead architect , Bill Johnson , has said the roof will resemble a camera shutter when it opens and closes . <p>  Even though the petals are going in a true straight line , the geometry allows them to look like they 're moving in a curved motion ,  Darden said . <p> While each of the eight panels moves a shorter distance than the fewer pieces on other retractable roofs , the oculus design and geometric angles have made construction more complex , more intricate . <p>  More tedious and more time-consuming ,  Darden said . But the progress heartens him .  I see the end of the tunnel and see the daylight coming out .  <p> When the roof is closed , the Mercedes-Benz emblem will appear on the outside top of the retractable portion , an image sure to be prominent in TV 's aerial shots . But that large logo will be spread across all eight retractable panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <p>  It is literally part of the puzzle ,  Darden said .  When it is closed , it will look just like you painted it on .  <p> As you look down from the roof into the stadium now , you see other important work yet to be done : Many of the lower-level seats are n't in place , and the artificial turf has n't been installed . <p> But those are simple and swift tasks , at least by comparison to what 's up top . <h> About the Author <p> TIM TUCKER Tim Tucker covers stories at the intersection of sports and business . <h> Sign up for Newsletters <p> Want more news ?

18529919," Missouri appeals judge 's blocking of abortion restrictions <p> Missouri is asking a federal appellate court to put on hold a judge 's order blocking abortion-restricting rules in the state , arguing the judge  categorically refused even to consider the state 's evidence justifying its regulations .  <p> The state 's challenge Thursday to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs refused to delay enforcing the preliminary injunction he issued last month in favor of Planned Parenthood affiliates with Missouri health centers . <p> The law requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that clinics meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery -- restrictions Planned Parenthood protested as  medically unnecessary .  <p> Only one licensed abortion clinic remains in the state -- a Planned Parenthood center in St. Louis -- partly as a result of Missouri 's restrictions .

They are asking the courts to maintain these unsafe options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office fired back Thursday , pressing to the 8th Circuit that Planned Parenthood , with the  sweeping  injunction , intends to offer abortions at sites  that do not satisfy the state 's health-and-safety standards , posing an imminent threat to women 's health and safety .  <p>  The district court refused even to consider this evidence .

Now the restrictions apply to any nongovernmental group receiving funds provided by the State Department , the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Defense . So the plan would apply to the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , or PEPFAR , which funds HIV prevention and treatment in nearly 60 countries , and the President 's Malaria Initiative . <p> The amount of U.S. funds now covered are nearly $9 billion compared with $600 million in earlier iterations . <p>  It has a bigger reach than it 's ever had before , and many of the organizations that could now be affected have never confronted it before ,  says Jennifer Kates , director of global health and HIV policy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be felt in communities where one stand-alone clinic addresses a wide span of health needs . The local reproductive health clinic could receive PEPFAR funding for a program to prevent HIV transmission or U.S. funding to provide bed nets to ward off malaria-carrying mosquitoes . If that clinic provides or promotes abortion , then all of those U.S. funds would now be cut . <p> There are strong reactions to the policy from anti-abortion groups and from supporters of abortion rights . <p>  This is going to result in an increase in the number of unintended pregnancies , in the number of unsafe abortions , in the number of mothers dying , whether from pregnancy-related causes or HIV causes , and also in the number of infant and child deaths ,  says Geeta Rao Gupta , executive director for the United Nations Foundation 's 3D Program for Girls &amp; Women , which addresses the needs and rights of women . <p> Some research has shown that when the Mexico City policy is in force , abortion rates can rise . One study by Stanford University researchers , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that abortions in sub-Saharan African countries held steady at about 10 per 100,000 women every year from 1994 to 2000 during the Clinton administration , which did not enforce the policy . President George W. Bush reinstated the Mexico City policy in 2001 , and from 2001 to 2008 , there were 14.5 abortions per 100,000 women every year . <p> The study authors note that it 's not possible to be completely certain about the reason for the rise . But they theorize that when women lose access to modern contraceptives like birth control pills because the clinics that provided them had shut down because of a loss of funds , some of the women may turn to unsafe abortions . In 2008 , 47,000 women died from complications after unsafe abortions , according the World Health Organization . <p> The Trump version of the rule does allow referrals for abortions in some limited cases , such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and when the mother 's physical health is at risk .

18533208," The Trump administration announced earlier this week a massive expansion of the so-called  global gag rule ,  a policy that cuts off U.S. support from nongovernmental organizations abroad if they so much as provide information about abortion to women who might want to hear it . This expansion will have a devastating impact on global health -- particularly for women and families -- as well as on free speech . <p> The global gag rule stops foreign NGOs from using their own money to provide abortions , information about abortion , or referrals for abortion to women who want them . In addition , it prohibits groups receiving U.S. funding from engaging in legal and political advocacy to promote changes to a country 's laws or policies related to abortion . It also bans NGOs from running public education campaigns to provide people with truthful information about abortion . <p> The president 's announcement came just one day after he issued a statement marking the start of Women 's Health Week , calling for affordable , accessible , and quality healthcare for women . Yet this policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things worse . <p> Previous administrations that have imposed the global gag rule have made it a condition of receiving grants from a pool of some $600 million in family planning funding . The Trump administration has drastically expanded the reach of the policy to apply to all global health assistance furnished by the U.S. -- to the tune of $8.8 billion . That means that money intended for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment , or for combating malaria and Zika , is now conditioned on compliance with a rule that is inherently devastating to women and families the world over . <p> When the global gag rule has been imposed in the past , the health consequences have been severe : Clinics that provided reproductive , maternal , and child health care services were shuttered Access to contraception was restricted And the number of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions increased -- factors that lead to more women and children dying . <p> The expansion of this dangerous policy means that not only will women lose access to critical reproductive health care , counseling , and information , but there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . If organizations refuse to stop providing truthful and often life-saving information about abortion that their clients want and need , they may have to shut down critical programs that prevent and treat HIV/AIDS , fight infectious diseases , and improve nutrition , hygiene , and maternal and child health throughout the world . Simply put , it will devastate health care access in some of the world 's neediest communities . <p> Let 's be clear : The Trump administration is essentially coercing groups by telling them that if they want to continue to receive aid that their community desperately needs -- to prevent maternal mortality , to stop the spread of malaria , to provide health care for children -- they must give up their right to engage in truthful speech that the U.S. government does n't like . <p> For the communities that can not afford to lose U.S. health aid , the administration is ensuring the silence of the very experts who can provide a unique perspective on reproductive health and is stopping the free flow of information . The limits on advocacy and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on U.S. global health aid will not hear from the full range of local groups and medical experts on legal and policy debates about abortion . The rule expansion will also make it very difficult or impossible for U.S. groups and individuals to partner with foreign groups to engage in legal advocacy and education , and it will stymie research into abortion-related health outcomes -- thereby hampering the advancement of medical science . <p> The government should not be able to do to foreign organizations what would be unconstitutional were it imposed on domestic groups , which can not be forced to censor their private speech as a condition of government funding . There is no doubt that with this policy , the administration is not only trying to control the flow of information -- an unworthy goal for the U.S. government and contrary to the values of the First Amendment -- but also threatening the health and lives of women and families across the globe .

The individual highs that year were 4% excellent and 22% good . <p> Americans ' low regard for their nation 's moral values was evident in questions extending back well before the current questions were first asked 16 years ago . In 1991 , 63% of U.S. adults said they were dissatisfied with the ethics and moral standards of the American people . In a 1996 poll , 39% said the state of moral values in the country today was somewhat weak , and 39% said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Liberals ' Ratings Also Low <p> Americans who define their views on social issues as liberal have seen their ranks grow from 21% in 1999 to 30% this year , reflecting the movement of the public toward acceptance of liberal positions on several moral values-related issues . Americans now support liberal views in record numbers on 10 different social issues . <p> With public opinion on those issues moving in a liberal direction , and with major Supreme Court rulings in recent years supporting abortion rights and gay marriage , social conservatives have always been more likely than liberals to say the state of moral values is poor and more likely to say it is getting worse . But even among liberals , in no year have more than a third described moral values as excellent or good , and only in 2009 -- a few months after Barack Obama 's first presidential inauguration -- did less than a majority say it was getting worse . <p> The percentage of social liberals who thought moral values were getting worse stayed below 60% for most of Obama 's presidency but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration . The change from a Democratic White House to a Republican one also contributed to a substantial drop in pessimism among social conservatives . Seventy-seven percent -- an 11-percentage-point drop from last year -- now say moral values are getting worse . <p> With the percentage of moderates saying moral values are getting worse now up to 86% , 2017 is the first year social conservatives are not the group most likely to think values are worsening . <p> Attitudes Differ Widely by Age , Locale <p> No majority of any major demographic group views the state of moral values as good or excellent , but opinions differ significantly when looking at those who rate the state of the nation 's values as poor . The overall average for the 16 years that Gallup has been asking the question is 42% saying poor , but that rises above 50% among a few groups and drops to a third or less among others : <p> Major differences occur by age . About half ( 51% ) of those aged 65 and older believe moral values are in a poor state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fifty-four percent of those who live in a rural area , compared with 33% of those living a big city , say moral values are poor . <p> Thirty-one percent of those with postgraduate work say the country 's moral values are poor . <p> Bottom Line <p> Though majorities of Americans say they are proud of their country and are satisfied with their overall quality of life , they are not as positive about the state of the nation 's moral values . Even liberals , who seemingly should be pleased with the growing number of Americans who agree with their point of view on the morality of prominent social issues , are more likely to say things are getting worse than getting better . <p> Two possible reasons for the negativity among liberals in general and the rise in negativity this year among both moderates and liberals : <p> While social conservatives look at the decline in marriages , the increase in children born outside of marriage and the growing number of Americans identifying as nonreligious , social liberals have no lack of moral issues that concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nation and the nation 's efforts to deal with poverty and homelessness . Further , Trump 's emergence has brought forth a barrage of articles from liberal publications about the coarsening of moral values . <p> Americans are not necessarily thinking about moral values in terms of abortion , gay marriage or other social issues that produce legislation and Supreme Court rulings . Polls in 2010and 2012that asked respondents to cite the most important problem with moral values found that the reason most often cited was lack of respect or tolerance for others , with poor parenting also frequently mentioned . <p> With both conservatives and liberals criticizing the other side for lack of respect and with Americans of all backgrounds able to find some moral issue to deplore , there seems to be little chance of a substantive change in the near future to the longstanding trend of Americans having overwhelmingly negative views about the state of moral values . <h> Survey Methods <p> Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted May 3-7 , 2017 , with a random sample of 1,011 adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. states and the District of Columbia .

We 've seen this before several times ( the work of Hackaday alum Mathieu Stephan comes to mind ) but never with a user input quite as delightful as a bike pump .

As someone works the pump , the falling droplets appear to slow , stop , and then begin flowing against gravity . <p> Sadly this phenomenon is quite difficult to record in a video since the latency of our vision is integral for the trick to work .

Dark acrylic makes up a triangular case in the shape of the hackerspace 's logo . Water droplets are produced by an oscillating pump and fall from the apex of the triangle . A martini glass at the bottom catches the drops with some steel wool to prevent splashes . The system to recirculate the water is completely hidden from view .

The Showtime series , so far , takes those endurance-test scenes as a starting point . <p> The first kind , the funny geezers routine , is natural , since much of the original cast is back , aged 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're the leads . ) In the initial installment , not long after the stinking-rich Horne brothers ( Richard Beymer and David Patrick Kelly ) turn up to jaw at each other about nothing , Lynch and Frost show us a young man , in a secret Manhattan laboratory , staring at a glass box -- quite literally waiting for something to happen . <p> The director has warned us about our expectations before with his Peaks re-dos : Recall the ax smashing the television in Fire Walk With Me 's first shot . The promise there -- or threat -- was that Lynch and Peaks now were free from the standards and limitations of broadcast TV . Now , back on small screens that are n't as small as they used to be , Peaks again comments on its medium . Within the first half hour , that young man ( Ben Rosenfield ) gets seduced by a young woman ( Madeline Zima ) who dutifully strips down to her thong for the camera -- this is Showtime , after all . As they go at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something manifest itself inside that glass box , and to clear his head for a moment and even try to make sense of it he has to shove the nude flesh aside . Is there a better metaphor for the experience of watching cable dramas ? At ABC , Lynch and Frost had to work around commercials and censors ; now , it 's mandated tits and the occasional car-company logo . <p> The something that happens in that box is bloody terrible in all the ways the creators intend . We get some slow , addle-brained comedy routines in the Twin Peaks sheriff office , but much of the first three episodes lean toward horror . The story picks up where the series ended back in 1991 , with MacLachlan 's zen federal agent trapped in the zig-zag-tiled gallery space-cum-afterlife that the show called  The Black Lodge .  Meanwhile , his doppelg ? nger had been loosed on the world , a wicked Agent Cooper inhabited by the spirit of BOB ( the late Frank Silva , seen in old Peaks footage ) . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . The evil Cooper has , we learn , been missing all that time , with neither the feds nor the Twin Peaks police aware that he 's gone bad -- or even that he 's out there . But out there he is , crime-spreeing away . <p> Scrape off the mysticism , and we have an evil-twin plot , a noir ( and Lynch ) standby , a case of Good Coop/Bad Coop . Sporting long hockey hair and dampening down his David Byrne geniality , MacLachlan is effective as Bad Coop , though his scenes often have the glum feel of also-ran 90s indie flicks -- the ones where a Bad Dude and Hot Young Woman hit the road and blow up a gas-station . A lengthy motel confrontation between Bad Coop and a half-undressed Nicole LaLiberte stirs suspense , thanks to his menace and her steely quavers , but it 's also something Twin Peaks never was before : familiar . Guess what ? Lynch gives us ample time to regard the beauty with the blood on her face . <p> It 's Good Coop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even that , though , follows some rote and even hokey scenes . The second episode spends much time in that red-curtained parlor where speech runs backwards and nothing seems quite as freaky as it did in ' 91 . MacLachlan strides back and forth through it often enough that we get the layout down , and his encounters with most of the usual residents ( plus a talking tree ) lack the old portentousness . The scenes play out like they might have on a Myst-inspired Twin Peaks CD-ROM game . ( There 's also too little of Badalamenti 's music , which softened the strain of the strangeness . ) <p> Soon , though , Good Coop gets flushed out and then lost in time and space . The mode for much of the third installment is cosmic horror , with MacLachlan wandering new environments , the creep-outs aided by Lynch 's own unsettling ambient sound design but lessened somewhat by underwhelming visual effects . The visions here do n't suggest clues to gather or puzzles to solve , a fan-tendency Lynch lampooned in Fire Walk With Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotting out a woman to communicate , via her clothes and a sour-faced shuffle , to his field agents what they should expect on a case . Instead , Good Coop faces a series of odd trials before at last emerging back in our world -- but not in his mind . <p> Or any mind , really . The new Twin Peaks takes the ol ' amnesia plot to its extreme . Cooper wanders a casino unsure not just of who he is or where he 's been but of the underlying concepts of our existence : money , directions , how to pee . MacLachlan is hilarious and upsetting in these lengthy , supremely Lynchian scenes . What 's most alien here is n't the doings in the woods or riddles dispensed by giants . It 's normal life . <p> What 's going on in the woods is strange , too , of course . Lynch again excels at flashlit forest photography , at headlights pressing through blackness . And , again , we have police business . Intercut with Cooper 's travails is an investigation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Lillard is the prime suspect .

( Do n't let yourself be hurt this time . ) Another disappointment : The first woman of color with a speaking part has no eyes ; the second plays a topless prostitute . <p> Between all that and some distracting cameos , we get occasional disconnected glimpses of people we knew back in the original series : The most piercing is Grace Zabriskie , as Sarah Palmer , mother of the doomed Laura Palmer and wife to the murderer , sitting on a couch and watching a gruesome nature film on the big-screen TV that now dominates her home . Meanwhile , Lynch is back as the hard-of-hearing FBI bureau chief , on the trail of his long-time missing agent with the astringent forensics expert Albert ( Miguel Ferrer ) . <p> Ferrer , as you may have heard , died in January of this year ; also appearing posthumously is Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life disappointing us rather than the series , but as the return of Twin Peaks surges on after a promising but troubled start , I have to credit it with this : It 's the rare screen entertainment that allows us to contemplate faces that have aged in real time .

Westpac said the tax was  inefficient ,  while NAB said the tax could not be absorbed and could affect profitability . Treasurer Scott Morrison did not immediately respond to a request for comment . On May 14 he told reporters the tax  reflects the way major banks are treated all around the world  and said it would level the playing field for small lenders who did not benefit from implicit government guarantees .

18592734," Pernicious Conceit and the Limits of Democracy <p>  In the long run democracy will be judged , no less than other forms of government , by the quality of its leaders , a quality that will depend in turn on the quality of their vision .  So wrote Irving Babbitt , the famed Harvard professor who left few acknowledged disciples , yet whose influence has been distilled to the contemporary world through his many students , T.S . Eliot most prominent among them . <p> Babbitt was no hater of democracy , but like most serious political thinkers , he understood the limits of any political system , and , particularly , our own . He held no belief that a fixed theory of government could effectuate a permanent solution to the problems of order , justice , and freedom . He did not believe that government , democracy included , could remake man or alter his fundamental nature . But this did not preclude Babbitt from believing in the power of government to accomplish great things , so long as it was constructed upon the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Babbitt eschewed the idea that legitimacy in government can be derived from the conceited public flattery delivered by successful politicians in stump speeches , and , ultimately , achieved at the ballot-box .  The notion in particular that a substitute for leadership may be found in numerical majorities that are supposed to reflect the ' general will ' is only a pernicious conceit ,  he wrote . In this view , the victory of a simple majority does not render its voice the voice of truth . The voice of the people is not the voice of God . <p> Indeed , some of the greatest moral failures in modern politics have been the result of majoritarian demands and electoral victories . We need not forget that Germany in the early twentieth-century was among the most sophisticated , well-educated , wealthy , and civilized nations in the world , yet it elected Hitler as its leader . How could this happen and can it happen again ? <p> The answer is linked to the question of leadership quality , which is itself a function of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A population can at once be industrious and technologically advanced , while backing policies that trample the dignity of persons and the rights of minorities . In fact , periods of unbridled technological progress are often accompanied by political policies that subvert individual persons to the agenda of scientific advancement . The creation and use of the atomic bomb , the liberalization of abortion laws , support for eugenics to create  designer babies ,  and encouraging euthanasia for the sick , elderly , or other  unwanted  persons , bespeaks our own failures to treat everyone with respect notwithstanding the lip-service our culture pays to equality and humanitarianism . In each of these modern horrors , technology determines the scope of human dignity . <p> But if a majority of the American electorate determined that slavery should be reinstated and that the Thirteenth Amendment ( which banned slavery ) should be rescinded , justice would demand strenuous opposition . Yet in the name of tolerance and progress , the contemporary electorates of almost all Western nations accept policies that similarly beget unspeakable violence against persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unborn , elderly , and mentally handicapped . Are these persons worth nothing ? Are they not persons at all ? Are they not worthy to live , and breathe , and one-day die with dignity ? Are we , by virtue of policies put into effect by democratically elected leaders , endowed with the jurisdiction to determine who is worthy of life and respect ? Hardly . Right and wrong can not determined by a simple majority vote , nor should they be . <p> In the United States , the language of democracy is a powerful , yet often dangerous , tool . The most artful politicians are often the most skilled flatterers of public ego and use the rhetoric of  the people  as their weapon of choice . Pandering to popular sentiment and stoking the fires of avarice , these knaves of the governing class will exploit plebiscitary interests for electoral gain , and once in power , must deliver on their sordid promises . In our fragile system of republican government , the impulsive and ephemeral cries of the mob must be weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if approved by a vast majority of the voting population , might be bad policy . But that requires the majority to question itself . It requires self-discipline and humility -- commodities always in short-supply . <p> Moreover , democracy can not be an effective or desirable governing system unless the people exercising the franchise are concerned with the cultivation of virtue in their own lives . If the voting public comprises citizens striving to achieve a virtuous life ( even if they are not always successful in doing so ) , a healthy democracy may emerge . <p> If not , a plebiscitary democracy premised on flattery , bribery , and sheer power will prevail .

( Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune via AP ) <p> The Washington Examiner 's Salena Zito has been writing frequently on the divorce between elite journalistic institutions like The Washington Post or the New York Times and the residents of the Rust Belt . Consider her latest : <p> Beginning in the 1980s , Washington and New York City newsrooms began to be dominated by people who had the same backgrounds ; for the most part they went to the same Ivy League journalism schools , where they made the right contacts and connections to get their jobs . ... <p> After a while you adopt the culture you exist in either out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really just wanted to shed your working-class roots for a variety of reasons : shame , aspiration , ascension , etc . ... <p> So when fewer and fewer reporters shared the same values and habits of many of their consumers , inferences in their stories about people of faith and their struggles squaring same-sex marriage or abortion with their belief systems were picked up by the readers . <p> Pro-tip , do n't think people ca n't pick up an inference , even the most subtle , in the written word . It is as evident as a news anchor rolling his eyes at someone on his panel he does n't agree with . <p> The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts would not contest Zito 's thesis that greater understanding usually leads to superior journalism .

When media coverage turns to events happening on college campuses , a lack of understanding and local knowledge can also lead to wild distortions . Journalists who grew up in the Midwest but then depart it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roots . The same holds true for commentators who spend four years at an elite college campus and then many more years away from the ivory tower . <p> Consider , for example , the latest effort by academics to replay the Sokal hoax , in which a scholar manages to get an article intentionally filled with gibberish published in a peer-reviewed journal o expose the journal 's lax standards . Last week , two academics proudly declared that they had fooled a peer-reviewed academic journal into publishing a BS paper with the amusing title ,  The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct .  What fun ! Several conservativecritics of the academy -- along with some academics who really should have known better -- delighted in tweeting out the tale as told by the academics . Editors who delight in mocking the sillier and more obscurantist aspects of the academy joined in . <p> The trouble in this case , however , is that the hoax was n't quite so impressive as the original one executed by Alan Sokal . In that case , Sokal managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on the rise and respectable within the cultural studies circle . In this case , the two scholars tried to submit it to a reputable gender studies journal , got dinged from that journal , and were referred by an automated email to another journal : Cogent Social Studies . <p> Now , to those readers who are not in the academy , that journal title might sound nondescript . As a social scientist , however , let me assure you that this title fills me with dread . Here 's why : <p> Email I get from Cogent Social Sciences every few months that I send to my spam folder . And I get about ten of these kinds of emails a week . **26;704;TOOLONG <p> Put bluntly : Cogent Social Sciences has unknowing academics pay for publications . I get queries from journals like this all the time , as do most professors . They go right to my spam folder , because these journals generate no value from the peer review process . I 'm not the target audience anyway -- that would be the grad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While this open-access journal claims to employ peer review , in fact articles are only reviewed by a single individual and just about all are accepted . And while it is published by Taylor and Francis , a respected publisher , the journal 's website makes clear that it operates entirely independently of Taylor &amp; Francis , and that its publishing model is utterly different from theirs . <p> So , on the basis of publishing a hoax paper in an obscure vanity journal with zero credibility in the field they wished to  expose ,  the authors -- and those who praise them -- somehow jump to the conclusion that the entire discipline of gender studies is corrupt . <p> Consistent with Zito 's plea , it is noteworthy that Reason 's Robby Soave -- someone who has not been afraid to report critically about the less savory aspects of the academy -- is nonetheless knowledgeable enough about how things work to know that this was a prank of dubious value :  if the main criticism of gender studies is that it 's unscientific and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not falling prey to dogma themselves . Skeptics ought to be more , well , skeptical .  <p> This applies not just to this scandal , but to skeptics of the academy attempting to , say , minimize charges of plagiarism or describe students walking out of a commencement speech as  afraid .  I 'm not saying that critical stories about life in the academy are always wrong ; there has been some excellent critical writing in this area as of late . But this latest scandal suggests that there are a group of elites who are primed to believe the worst about the academy , when life is not nearly that simple . As I noted in The Ideas Industry , colleges are getting attacked from all sides , and it is far from obvious just who that benefits . <p> Zito is correct that elite writers should go out of their way to better understand the milieu of the Rust Belt .

@@18593684 <h> Will The Proposed Tax Reforms Spell The End Of MLPs ? <p> President Trump has so far only released an outline of his plan , and the Republican plan currently in the House is also subject to change . Despite Trump 's optimism that tax reform will be completed this year , it could be into 2018 when changes take effect . Given that considerable uncertainty , we will assess in broad strokes the potential changes given what information is currently available . <p> Right now , the major proposed changes include : <p> Lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15% 1 <p> Lowering the highest individual tax rate from 39.6% to 35% <p> Border adjustment tax on imports of 20% <p> First and most obviously : MLPs are pass-through entities that pay no federal income tax , so , surface answer is that changes to the federal tax code should n't affect them . Unfortunately , it 's rarely that easy . Since the income is n't tax-free , just passed-though , someone does pay the tax . But , with the individual rate also proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Impact of Lowered Corporate Income TaxOn newly forming companies . While there would be little change made to a model of an MLP 's performance , the more likely concern is competitive advantage . Not only will new companies have less incentive to choose the structure , a lowered corporate tax rate would decrease the benefit differential to an MLP investment . We could expect fewer new MLP IPOs . <p> On existing MLPs converting to C corporations . This is another version of the Kinder question : will more MLPs convert to C corporations ? Again , paying 0% in federal taxes is better than 15% , but since energy infrastructure companies are continually building assets and taking advantage of accelerated depreciating accounting rules , their tax burden would already be quite low . Without the strictures of the MLP structure , they could opportunistically expand into businesses that are not currently permitted under the IRS rules as well as benefit from a broader investor base ( since most investors balk at receiving K-1s ) . <p> On the MLP investor base . Under the current system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7% , and the S&amp;P500 yields around 2% . If the corporations in the S&amp;P500 pay less in taxes , they have more money available to distribute to shareholders . REITs , which also are pass-through entities , yield around 4% . As interest rates continue to rise , making bonds more attractive ( eventually ) , and as dividends increase from traditional corporations , the thirst for yield present in the market for the past several years will at last , start to be satisfied . Unfortunately for MLPs , that means there may be less yield-based demand for them . The income-focused portion of the MLP investor base might be distracted by other shiny , high and stable yields . <p> At first blush , this is not encouraging ; however , yield is not the only reason to own MLPs , despite what some media outlets and your wacky cousin want you to believe . The real asset exposure and participation in US energy infrastructure remain unaffected by changes to the tax code . In fact , it 's possible that as yield-driven money turns its focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence valuations . <p> Considering the impact this would have on the investing landscape , this increased desirability of 100% MLP funds could offset the argument that there may be less yield-based demand for MLPs due to increased demand for other yield-instruments as noted above . MLPs have traditionally been held at the individual level , but that has shifted towards funds ever since their invention ( thanks primarily to the funds ' lack of a K-1 ) . The lowered corporate tax rate on these funds would only strengthen that momentum . <p> Impact of Lowered Personal Tax Rate The proposed changes would bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% , and the highest individual income bracket down to 35% . While this could incentivize some highly-paid salaried workers to become independent contractors in order to pay less in taxes , it could also incentivize investors in partnerships and LLCs to hold their investments . Such an obvious loophole could lead to blatant exploitation , which generally leads to elimination of loopholes . As with any proposed tax change impacting pass-throughs ( and although this is quite unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a risk of MLPs being caught up in legislation and the structure eliminated . <p> Miscellaneous ImpactsNew 20% Tax on Imports . MLPs prefer to lock in the IRR for any new project before a shovel breaks ground . This involves signing contracts with both customers and with suppliers ; however , there remains some exposure to price fluctuations . If imported steel becomes more expensive , that can drive up costs . On the other hand , a tax on imported crude oil would benefit domestic producers who move their products on MLP pipeline systems . <p> No tax on foreign earnings at corporate level . This could make foreign investment more attractive as compared to an investment in MLPs . That said , there are n't really similar fundamental energy infrastructure opportunities abroad , given that the US is one of the few countries to have privatized , investable energy infrastructure . <p> Elimination of the inheritance tax . Many investors use MLPs for estate planning purposes . Since 70%-90% of the distribution in a given year is often categorized as return of capital , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself , but when an MLP with a very low cost basis is passed along to heirs in an estate , the heirs receive a step-up in the cost basis and the tax on that recapture is not owed . Without inheritance tax , the estate-planning-based demand for MLPs could lessen . <p> Vague Questions Get Vague Answers Without a concrete tax plan , the majority of these implications remain thought experiments . Charts , data , and firm calculations will have to wait . In the meantime , the giddy optimism that a lowered corporate tax rate would provide an immediate benefit is probably over-enthusiastic . At the same time , apathy resulting from a too-simplistic view that 0% &lt; 15% is perhaps too relaxed . As always with MLPs , it 's complicated and we 'll keep watching it . <p> Footnotes : <p> 1 While the machinations of corporate accountants are outside our bailiwick , we must also point out that under the current system , corporations rarely pay taxes at the 35% rate .

Economists are clear : That 's where we ultimately get our economic growth .  <p> The Trump administration is expected to introduce its 2018 budget proposal on May 23 , which will likely include major cuts to programs for low-income Americans . ( Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post ) <p> In a conference call with reporters organized by AAAS , retired aerospace executive Norman Augustine said the proposed cuts would be drive many young people out of the fields of science and technology :  We 're likely to lose a whole generation of researchers .  <p> Mary Woolley , president of the advocacy group Research ! America , noted that Trump 's budget spends more money on the military , and said ,  We all want a nation worth defending after all . A healthy and a prosperous nation . The president 's budget would not get us there .  <p> Slashing programs that normally have enjoyed bipartisan support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillions of dollars in spending over the next decade while at the same time paying for tax cuts and increases in military spending . <p> Congress has the power of the purse and could essentially ignore the more detailed budget request . Early reactions on both sides of the aisle have been generally unfavorable . One Republican lawmaker , Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma , flinched at the thought of cutting NIH and such programs as Meals on Wheels . Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) , head of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus , sounded queasy about cuts to Meals on Wheels , saying he 'd delivered meals to people for whom  perhaps it 's their only hot meal of the day .  <p> Meanwhile Eddie Bernice Johnson ( D-Texas ) , ranking member of the House Science Committee , said ,  Instead of preserving and promoting America 's leadership in science and technology , this budget would put our nation on a path of decline .  <p> Advocates for cutting science and medicine budgets point to the funding that agencies provide research institutions for indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Committee will hold a hearing , titled  Examining the Overhead Cost of Research ,  that will look specifically at how the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies negotiate those costs . <p> OMB director Mulvaney , briefing reporters , said the administration had produced a  taxpayer-first  budget , saying that compassion should be offered not only to the needy who receive government resources but also to the people who pay the taxes to fund such programs .  Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation ,  Mulvaney said . <p> The administration 's detailed budget request calls the termination of many research-related programs , such as the Department of Energy 's Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy ( ARPA-E ) . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's grant and education program , which has $262 million in 2017 funding , would be zeroed out .  These grant and education programs generally support State , local , and/or industry interests , and these entities may choose to continue some of this work with their own funding ,  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science at the Department of Energy would lose about one-sixth of its funding , a $900 million cut . The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy faces a 69 percent funding cut and a 28 percent reduction in staffing . The OMB budget describes these reductions as reflecting  an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later-stage research , development , and commercialization of energy technologies  and focuses funding on early-stage research . <p> Also terminated would be NASA 's Office of Education , as well as five NASA Earth Science missions that the administration considers to be low-priority . The administration said killing those Earth Science missions would save $191 million . The Trump administration is also declining to put in money for a robotic probe to land on Jupiter 's moon Europa , even though that it required under the NASA authorization act recently signed into law . <p> NASA acting administrator Robert Lightfoot , taking the stage in an auditorium at NASA headquarters , gave an upbeat assessment of OMB 's budget request , which includes a modest cut to the agency 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this budget tells us to do is keep going ,  Lightfoot said . <p> Among key health-care changes : <p> Planned Parenthood would be barred from receiving any HHS funding , according to a fact sheet accompanying the budget release -- a prohibition that would apply not just to Medicaid but to all programs . The fact sheet notes that this move  follows through on a campaign promise  to block federal dollars from  certain entities that provide abortions , including Planned Parenthood .  <p> Funding for the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) would be slashed by at least 20 percent for the next two fiscal years . According to the budget document , the administrator favors a renewal of CHIP , a program created 20 years ago for the children of lower-working class families and which currently insures 5.6 million children . <p> The spending plan would , however , eliminate an element of the Affordable Care Act that increased by 23 percent the portion of the program 's costs that is paid for with federal money , leaving states to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time essentially limit states ' eligibility levels to qualify , saying that the government would no longer help cover children from families with incomes of more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level . Currently , 18 states plus the District of Columbia allow families with incomes higher than 300 percent of the poverty line to sign up their children for CHIP , according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> CDC already has nearly 700 vacancies under a government hiring freeze that HHS has kept in place . <p> The president 's budget seeks an $82 million cut at the center that works on vaccine-preventable and respiratory diseases , such as influenza and measles . It proposes a cut of $186 million from programs at CDC 's center on HIV/AIDS , viral hepatitis , sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis prevention . One of the biggest cuts , $222 million , is to the agency 's chronic disease prevention programs , which are designed to help people prevent diabetes , heart disease and stroke , and obesity . <p> Some of those funds are being channeled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories to focus on  leading chronic disease challenges specific to each state .  Critics have said block grants allow states to plug holes in their budgets , without accountability that federal programs require . <p> The agency 's center on birth defects and developmental disabilities also gets a 26 percent cut to its budget at a time when researchers have yet to understand the full consequences of Zika infections in pregnant women and their babies and the underlying causes of autism . <p> The budget calls for a 17 percent cut to CDC 's global health programs that monitor and respond to disease outbreaks around the world . It also cuts about 10 percent from CDC 's office of public health preparedness and response . <p> The budget document highlights $35 million that the CDC spends on childhood lead poisoning prevention . But the overall spending on environmental health would under Trump 's plan be cut by $60 million , down to $157 million , according the document . <p> Trump administration officials have also proposed the establishment of an Emergency Response Fund to respond quickly to emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zika epidemics , U.S. officials have repeatedly called for the need for such a fund . The budget does not provide a specific amount . It says HHS would have  department-wide transfer authority to support the Fund in the case of a natural or man-made disaster or threat .  The fund would be available to receive a transfer of up to one percent of any HHS account , without any limitation on the total , for use in emergency preparedness and response . <p> The Food and Drug Administration would see a cut in federal funding from $2.74 billion to $1.89 billion . To offset the reduction , user fees paid by manufacturers of drugs , devices and other medical products , which now total $1.2 billion and cover nearly half the cost of all medical-product activities , would be increased by more than $1.1 billion . As a result , the agency 's overall funding would increase by more $400 million . <p> But hiking industry fees is n't likely to go anywhere on Capitol Hill . Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to reopen negotiations with the industry over fees that it pays to support FDA activities . His committee recently approved legislation that ignores the administration request for higher user fees . <p> The budget retains the Office of National Drug Control Policy , which had been threatened with virtual extinction , with a $368.5 million budget , a small decrease from its 2017 funding . In an email sent to full-time employee earlier this month , Richard Baum , the acting director of the office , said the administration 's proposal for the fiscal year that begins in October would reflect  a nearly 95 percent  cut in the agency 's budget . That appears to have been largely reversed . <p> White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called the administration 's budget proposal a  Taxpayer First Budget ,  on May 23 , and defended its cuts to federal anti-poverty programs .

The goal was to see if mammalian swimmers can maintain their spunk amid harsh cosmic radiation -- which they 'll undoubtedly have to endure for humans to thrive in the coming space age . The result : after nine months on the International Space Station ( ISS ) , sperm did show signs of DNA damage , but they were still able to produce healthy , fertile offspring . <p> This is good news , the authors explain in PNAS .  In the future , humans likely will live on large-scale space stations or in other space habitats for several years or even over many generations ,  they write . To maintain genetic diversity in small colonies , treat infertility , and breed domestic animals in our future interstellar homes , preserved sperm and eggs may be critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sperm were up for the task . Space radiation can cause DNA damage , which could lead to mutations and tumors .

The researchers went with freeze-drying rather than cryopreserving to keep costs low -- there was no need to launch a heavy freezer into space . Freeze-drying kills sperm , but its preserved contents can still be used to fertilize an egg . <p> While on the ISS from August of 2013 to May of 2014 , the space sperm were exposed to radiation levels about 100 times higher than those on Earth . This caused noticeable , but relatively minor , DNA damage . <p> Back on Earth , the researchers rehydrated the sperm and squirted them directly into fresh egg cells .

While this raises prospects for future space-sperm preservation , the authors note that more studies are needed to assess the effects for human sperm , longer space time , and trips deeper into space , where there 's more radiation . <p> Still , the authors are optimistic that we 'll have things figured out before the space age arrives .

If we have as many countries as possible who can contribute , it could be any amount , I think that will help ,  Tedros added . <p> As director-general of WHO , Tedros will be responsible for deciding which medical issues will take priority and when crises like disease outbreaks will be treated as global emergencies . <p> WHO is still recovering from criticism over its handling of the 2014 ebola outbreak <p> A humble background <p> Tedros was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in community health and the immunology of infectious diseases from the UK , is married and has five children . <p> While running as a candidate for the WHO position , he recounted a story from his childhood in which his brother died from a common , preventable disease .

18618151," Right Now We 're Living the ' Allegory of Bad Government , ' and We Have an Obligation to Resist It <p> On April 25 , I was thrilled to deliver a TED Talk in Vancouver . I 'm a lover of Italian art , and one of my favorite old masters is Ambrogio Lorenzetti . In 1339 , Lorenzetti finished a series of frescos whose message resonates with us today as President Donald Trump attacks the values that define America . <p> Lorenzetti 's  Allegory of Good and Bad Government  is a reminder that good government is characterized by Justice , Concord , Peace , and Wisdom while bad government is animated by Division , Avarice , Fury , Vainglory , even Tyranny . When good government reigns , all is well . When bad government plagues the realm , the Tyrant usurps the power of the people and the citizens suffer . <p> For me , and I hope for you , the paintings are a call to action . Democracy , as I say in the talk , is not a spectator sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good government -- in the form of people taking to the streets and the courts working as they should -- has shown that the American people and our form of government will persevere if we stay vigilant and jealously guard our liberties . <p> Our choice is clear : We can either stay in the streets or find ourselves painted into Lorenzetti 's  Allegory of Bad Government .  <p> Silicon Valley is obsessed with  disruption .  But these days , the biggest disruptor did n't come out of Silicon Valley . It came out of steel towns in Ohio , rural communities in Pennsylvania , the Panhandle in Florida . <p> This last presidential election was the mother of all disruptions . <p> Once again , politics is personal . Millions of Americans became activists overnight , pouring into the streets , in record numbers , in record time . <p> The election did to family holiday dinners what Uber did to the New York City taxi system . <p> Couples have broken up . Marriages disrupted . <p> And the election is doing to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These days , the ACLU is on the front lines 24/7 . If I try to sneak away for a few miles on the treadmill , any cardio benefit is instantly obliterated by the blood pressure spike that comes with reading another presidential tweet on the headline scroll . <p> Even my secret pleasure of studying the Italian painters has been infected by politics . <p>  Art is a lie that makes us realize truth ,  said Picasso . <p> I study , even stalk , the old masters . This is my desk -- with my postcard exhibition of famous and obscure paintings -- mostly from the Italian Renaissance . <p> Art used to provide a necessary escape from the hurly burly of politics and my work at the ACLU . <p> Not anymore . <p> I was at the women 's march in San Francisco the day after inauguration . The crowd was chanting ,  This is what democracy looks like .  Suddenly , I flashed on an old Italian fresco that first captivated me many years ago . Holding my sign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government . It 's almost like the old master was taunting me ,  You want to know what democracy looks like ? Go back and look at my frescoes .  So I did . <p> In 1339 , Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of Sienna 's Palazzo Pubblico . His paintings still speak to us -- even scream to us -- 800 years later . <p>  Art is a lie that makes us realize truth ,  said Picasso . <p> And as we search for the truth about government , we should keep Ambrogrio 's work -- not a lie but an allegory -- in our collective mind 's eye . <p> In Lorenzetti 's time , the political legitimacy of Italian city-states was often on very shaky ground . Sienna was a republic . Yet there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission . <p> Sienna 's political leaders , who would literally govern under the eyes of these allegorical figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the governing to the governed . <p> You can spend years studying the frescoes . Some scholars have . <p> I 'm hardly a scholar , but I am passionate about art . <p> A work this massive can overwhelm me . So first , I focus on the big stuff . <p> This is the  Allegory of Good Government .  The majestic figure in the middle here -- dressed in Sienna 's colors -- personifies the republic itself . Lorenzetti labels him Commune , and he is telling the Siennese that they -- not a king or tyrant -- must rule themselves . <p> Surrounding Commune are his advisers . <p> Justice is enthroned and looking up at the figure of Wisdom , who actually supports herscales . <p> Concord -- or harmony -- holds a chord that originates from the scales of Justice and binds her to the citizens -- making them all compatriots in the republic . <p> Finally , we see Peace . She looks chilled out , like she 's listening to Bob Marley . When good government rules , Peace does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . <p> But I really love the small stuff . <p> Disruptive . Messy . Loud . That is what democracy looks like . <p> Along another wall , Lorenzetti illustrates the impact of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people , with a series of delicious little details . <p> In the countryside , the hills are landscaped and farmed . Crops are being sown , hoed , reaped , milled , and plowed all in one picture . Crops and livestock are brought to market . <p> In the city , builders raise a tower . People attend a law lecture -- a TED talk of the 14th century . School children play . Tradesmen thrive . Dancers -- larger than life -- dance with joy . <p> What 's incredible is that these images , 800 years old , are familiar to us today . We see what democracy looks like . We experience the effects of good government in our world , just as Lorenzetti did in his life . <p> But it 's the  Allegory of Bad Government  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's badly damaged , but it reads like today 's newspapers . <p> Ruling over Bad Government is not the Commune , but the Tyrant . <p> He has horns , tusks , crossed eyes , and braided hair . He obviously spends a lot of time on that hair . <p> Justice now lies helpless at his feet , shackled , her scales destroyed . Justice is obviously the key antagonist to the Tyrant , and she 's been taken out . <p> Treason -- half lamb , half scorpion -- lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons the republic . <p> Fraud -- with the flighty wings of a bat . <p> On the Tyrant 's left , Divisionis clothed in Sienna 's colors . Si and No are painted on her body . She chops her body in half with a carpenter 's saw . <p> Fury -- wields the weapons of the mob -- the stone and knife . <p> Democracy must n't be a spectator sport . <p> In the remainder of the fresco , Lorenzetti shows us the inevitable effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room have now failed us . And we see it . <p> The once beautiful city is falling to pieces . The countryside is barren ; its farms abandoned -- many in flames . <p> In the sky above , the winged figure is not Security , but Fear . Her banner reads :  None shall pass along this road without fear of Death .  <p> The final image -- the most important really -- is one that Lorenzetti did n't paint . It is of the viewer . Today , the audience for Lorenzetti 's fresco is not the governing but the governed : the individuals who stand in front of his allegories and walk away with insight -- who heed a call to action . <p> The frescoes warn us that we must recognize the shadows of Fury , Division , Vainglory , and even Tyranny when they float across our political landscape . Especially when those shadows are cast by individuals loudly claiming the voice of good government -- promising to make America great again . <p> And we must act . <p> Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest . The right to assemble freely . The right to petition one 's government . These are not just rights . In the face of Avarice , Fraud , and Division , these are obligations . <p> We have to disrupt our own lives -- so that we can disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values . We -- we the people -- must raise Justice up , bring peace to our nation , and come together in Concord . <p> We have a choice . We can paint ourselves into Lorenzetti 's nightmare of Bad Government .

It would mandate that physicians provide education and employment information , including any disciplinary actions , to clients at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion . It also specifies that information be printed in black ink with a specific font .

The campaign pitted Gianforte , a onetime gubernatorial candidate whose net worth has been estimated at nearly $200 million , against Quist , 69 , a cowboy-poet and musician with a history of unpaid taxes who had never run for office . <p> Some political strategists had acknowledged that Gianforte 's strong personality was becoming an issue in the race , as it had during his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 2016 . <p>  As soon as Greg started getting attacked on TV , people were like , ' Oh , yeah , that guy , the billionaire jerk from New Jersey , '  an unnamed Republican strategist familiar with the race told Roll Call this week . <p> Greg Gianforte , the Republican candidate for Montana 's only U.S. House seat , sits in a vehicle Wednesday after allegedly body-slamming a reporter . ( Freddy Monares/Associated Press ) <p> Gianforte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has campaigned with Vice President Pence and Donald Trump Jr . and spent time hunting -- a favorite pastime -- with the latter . <p> According to some critics , he has even channeled the president 's tough-guy persona . <p> Gianforte was born in San Diego and spent his formative years in the Philadelphia suburbs before receiving degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken , N.J. <p> He started his career at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in 1983 . By his mid-30s , Gianfortehad retired to Montana after selling his first software company , BrightWork Development , to nascent software giant McAfee for more than $10 million , according to Inc. , a monthly business magazine . <p> A few years later , in 1997 , he started his second technology venture , RightNow Technologies , providing customer service software . Oracle acquired the company in 2011 for a reported $1.5 billion . Gianforte received more than $100 million from the sale , a figure that brought his total income between 2005 and 2014 to $220.5 million , according to an Associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time running RightNow , Gianforte became close to colleague Steve Daines , now Montana 's junior senator . Daines , a Republican and one of Gianforte 's closest allies in state politics , has called on him to apologize for Wednesday 's incident . <p> Gianforte first considered living in Montana during a hiking trip to the state in junior high school . Since moving there in the mid-1990s , he and his wife , Susan , have become part of the fabric of life in Bozeman , with their interest in technology start-ups , evangelical Christian faith and conservative political beliefs defining their ties to the community , according to news reports . <p> Their philanthropy and activism have not come without controversy . Gianforte was a significant funder of the creationist Dinosaur and Fossil Museum in Glendive , Mont. , which presents exhibits on the Earth 's age and the origins of the dinosaurs  in the context of biblical history .  <p> Speaking at the Montana Bible College in 2015 , Gianforte raised eyebrows for his comment that  the concept of retirement is not biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah ,  he said , according to the HuffPost .  How old was Noah when he built the ark ? Six hundred . He was n't , like , cashing Social Security checks , he was n't hanging out , he was working . So , I think we have an obligation to work .  <p> Gianforte also lobbied against an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Bozeman in 2014 , suggesting in an email to city officials that allowing discrimination based on sexual orientation would be good for the local economy . <p>  Homosexual advocates try to argue that businesses are leery of locating in towns that are n't friendly to homosexuals . I believe the opposite is truer ,  Gianforte wrote in the email , obtained in 2015 by the National Journal . <p> During his 2016 race for Montana governor , Gianforte sought to clarify his position on the measure in a meeting with the editorial board of the Billings Gazette . He  endorsed nondiscrimination for workers . ? . ? . but not for customers ,  the paper wrote . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of higher education . In 2014 , Montana Tech , a state-run university in Butte , announced that the couple would be its commencement speakers , prompting a backlash from students and faculty members . <p> Two years later , the Montana Board of Regents faced similar protests while considering an $8 million donation from the Gianfortes that would involve naming a university department after them . The board ultimately accepted the gift and approved the name change . <p> Gianforte 's sale of RightNow in 2011 ushered in a period of intense involvement in conservative education causes for the former executive . At the time , he was already a decade into a 14-year tenure as chairman of the board of Petra Academy , a K-12 Christian school in Bozeman that his children attended . The family donated $11.1 million to the school between 2005 and 2013 through its private foundation . <p> In 2012 , Gianforte joined the boards of the Association of Classical and Christian Schools , the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice , and ACE Scholarships , all of which advocate for school choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did a variety of organizations that promote conservative Christian views such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage .

Gianforte sought to deflect attention to these donations during his 2016 gubernatorial campaign , presenting himself as a successful businessman and a proponent of Montana 's small technology community , not a conservative activist . <p> Comments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments , as are comments by users with these badges : .

@@18638485 <h> Help Support FanGraphs <p> Let me set two arbitrary thresholds for you . One is going to be 25% strikeouts . Nice , clean , familiar dividing line . The other is going to be 20 innings pitched , as a starter . That 's not very many innings , but it 's probably enough to show whether you 're a strikeout starter or not . <p> Between 2008 and 2016 , the Dodgers had 17 pitcher-seasons meet those criteria . That 's a lot ! The Indians are in second , with 11 . Then the Nationals had 10 , and the Tigers had nine , and so on . The Orioles had one . The Rockies had one . The Twins had zero . They 're the only team with zero , and this just further demonstrates a point we 've all understood seemingly forever : The Twins have n't collected strikeout starters . It 's been a while since Francisco Liriano , and it 's been even longer since Johan Santana . <p> This is one of the reasons why there 's been so much hype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make an impression .

Berrios has gotten a chance of late to make a *new* impression , a better impression . This time , he 's succeeding . This time , Berrios is pitching like he ought to pitch . Do n't look now , but the Twins have a quality starter . <p> I do n't want to dwell too much on 2016 's miserable cup of coffee . Berrios struggled to the tune of an 8+ ERA , but it just never made very much sense . Look at this table , covering Berrios ' performance against advanced competition since 2015 .

With every opportunity but one , Berrios has generated plenty more strikeouts than walks . It should go without saying that there 's no challenge quite like working in the major leagues , especially for the first time , but you 'd never expect that kind of drop-off . Numbers from the upper minors tend to be suggestive of numbers in the majors . Berrios came apart . Most players do n't . After a while , I have to imagine it all snowballed . <p> When you look at 2017 Berrios , it fits . In the majors , he 's started just three games , but the strikes are there , and the whiffs are there , and so Berrios looks like he 's supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a really good weapon . <p> Berrios did n't recently develop that breaking ball or anything , but now he gets to use it more if he wants to , in more advantageous counts . You can probably see with your eyes that the breaking ball has all kinds of lateral movement . It does n't have so much in the way of drop , but by the major three pitch characteristics , that breaking ball is a near twin of Yu Darvish 's slider . It 's also similar to the curveball thrown by the late Jose Fernandez . It 's a pitch with the potential to terrorize opposing hitters , and when Berrios is actually in command of his game , he hardly needs a reliable changeup . <p> As is often the case , Berrios needs his fastball to be there if he wants to unlock the other stuff . With that in mind , here 's where his fastballs have gone , in each of the last two years : <p> Berrios this year has thrown more fastballs in the zone , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased aggressiveness , in an attempt to get ahead and stay ahead . Now , I do n't think Berrios was ever necessarily trying to nibble . But let 's watch him throw some fastballs in particular . Here 's a regular fastball from 2016 : <p> Here 's a regular fastball from last week : <p> Before getting further into Berrios ' mechanics , I 'd like to say that some part of his 2016 struggles was almost certainly psychological . It 's not easy to get beat up for the first time , and Berrios even now is only 22 . There was also speculation during the summer that Berrios was tipping his pitches , and although that 's always a tough thing to prove or disprove , it 's there . It 's a theory . I do n't think Berrios erased his 2016 problems through ordinary mechanical tweaks alone . <p> But we might as well talk about what 's there . Berrios is a slightly different guy . One change is that Berrios now raises his hands above his head early in his delivery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it might be part of an effort to have Berrios slow things down . Then , if you pay attention to Berrios ' feet , you can see a significant adjustment -- Berrios has moved over on the rubber . Last year , he came set on the extreme first-base side . He 's moved to the third-base side . This can mean different things for different pitchers , but Berrios could be more comfortable coming from this angle . For a real explanation , you 'd have to talk to him . I think the more important stuff comes later on , anyway . <p> Two screenshots : <p> Two screenshots from two different pitches : <p> The hand with the ball is the same . Berrios ' back leg is the same . But now Berrios is being more aggressive with his glove hand . And Berrios has also changed what he does with his front leg .

It 's a little thing , but they usually are , with Berrios now having had his delivery a little bit simplified . He still looks like himself , yet a few quirks have been smoothed out . <p> It could be nothing . They could be innocent tweaks that have little to do with the real explanation . Maybe it comes down to Berrios now just pitching with confidence , and that 's all . There 's no substitute for a player getting to feel like he really belongs . No matter what , this time around , Jose Berrios is making sense . That 2016 stood out in large part because it was bizarre , in no way matching up with the established performance record . Perhaps for that reason alone , we all should 've expected a rebound . Berrios has rebounded , giving the Twins a starting pitcher worth the effort of tuning in . For the first several weeks , the Twins were successful as more or less the Miguel Sano show .

Tom Wolf 's bid to merge the Department of Corrections and the Board of Probation and Parole is hitting another wall of resistance , with House members , prosecutors and even two parole board members criticizing the bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday . <p> The crux of the opposition revolves around whether prison officials would have too much power over who should get paroled and when parole violators must go back to prison , without an independent agency making those decisions . <p> Merging the agencies has received approval from the state Senate , which passed legislation Wednesday , as part of a larger effort designed to help newly released inmates succeed once they are released .

As good news goes , though , she 's about it . <p> A serious problem for Dead Men Tell No Tales is the number of key Pirates personnel who have jumped ship . Founding director Gore Verbinski is long gone , of course , now replaced by Joachim R ? nning and Espen Sandberg , Norwegian helmers of the Oscar-nominated Kon-Tiki . Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski is absent for the first time , as are screenwriters Ted Elliott and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the script , but it was judged inadequate , and he was replaced by veteran script-doctor Jeff Nathanson . ) <p> Also among the missing , it might be said , is series star Johnny Depp -- Captain Jack Sparrow himself -- who over the course of 14 years of playing this character has run out of new things to do with his performance , and is now pretty much emailing it in . <p> The story , substantially incoherent , can be related only in outline . The MacGuffin this time around is the  Trident of Poseidon ,  an ancient artifact that has the power to  control the sea .  Keen in pursuit of this item is young Henry Turner ( Brenton Thwaites ) , the son of Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom , back briefly from the first three Pirates films ) . Henry believes the Trident can free his father from bondage aboard Davy Jones 's fearsome ghost ship , the Flying Dutchman . Jack Sparrow would like to lay hands on the Trident , too -- he would use it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pirate-hunting Spanish navy officer whom Sparrow consigned to zombie perdition during a long-ago confrontation in the spooky Devil 's Triangle .

She encounters him imprisoned on the isle of Saint Martin , and tells him she can find the Trident with the aid of a diary she inherited from her father . When it is discovered that she is both smart and highly educated ( she 's an astronomer , which might come in handy on a nautical adventure ) , Carina is judged to be a witch and sentenced to death by hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females , the filmmakers give us a passing shot of a shop sign that says No Dogs , No Women . ) <p> Also behind bars on Saint Martin is Captain Jack , who passed out in an alcoholic stupor while robbing a bank and is now due to test out the island 's newly acquired guillotine ( and in the process provide the movie 's funniest scene -- which is followed by its most laborious , in which an entire building is hauled through the streets of a town ) . Soon , Jack and Carina and Turner are all on the run , pursued by Salazar and a reluctant subordinate , Captain Hector Barbossa ( Geoffrey Rush in his fifth Pirates go-round , now outfitted with a poufy new wig ) . Another island is visited , a jungle is slogged through , and there 's some witless horology banter among the dimwit sailors .

There 's also a flash of Jack 's backstory , with semi-lookalike actor Anthony De La Torre playing the younger Sparrow , and the usual omni-overload of CGI , only some of which is successful . ( Really , if we just wanted to watch money being thrown away , we could book our own flights to present-day Saint Martin 's . ) The undead Salazar 's hair , which waves flowingly in the air as if he were underwater , is a lovely effect ; but the rendering of his zombie crew , with patches of their spectral bodies missing as if simply erased , is a visual annoyance .

He did n't even bother because he was n't worried about the government 's living within its means . He was focused on transferring wealth and using taxpayer money to fund a smorgasbord of leftist projects , from environmental boondoggles to dangerous Iranian nuclear deals . <p> President Trump 's first budget , however , exposes fault lines throughout the political system , not just among Democrats . To his credit , Trump at least aspires to balance the budget within 10 years based on certain growth assumptions . He proposed substantial spending reductions ( at least reductions in the rate of increase and some actual cuts -- e.g. , $1.4 trillion from Medicaid , $1.5 trillion from nondefense discretionary spending , $274 billion from certain welfare programs and some from Social Security disability ) in certain areas that even some Republican politicians have previously been afraid to tackle , from the Environmental Protection Agency to the State Department , including welfare reform . <p> Democrats and liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Trump with full-throated moral condemnation . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Trump 's budget is  literally a killer  for the American people . The always winsome Hillary Clinton denounced the budget as  an unimaginable level of cruelty .  MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said Trump 's budget is  hateful  and people are  scared as hell .  Where have you gone , Joe ( DiMaggio ) ? MSNBC 's Chris Matthews said the budget was written for  the wealthy people .  Republican John McCain and sidekick Lindsey Graham piously pronounced the proposal DOA . <p> So plaudits for Trump for these relatively bold proposals . Regrettably , however , Trump did not include any provisions to reform Medicare or Social Security retirement benefits . This is no surprise , because Trump campaigned on protecting these entitlements . The current proposals for health care reform also cloud the issue in a way that ca n't yet be measured . <p> So here 's where we are . Trump deserves serious credit for his proposed action on discretionary spending -- credit because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Democratic and media demagoguery . He also deserves credit for at least trying to balance the budget in the next decade . We need to call out demagogic leftist critics for fraudulently framing these efforts as cruel and for deliberately ignoring that we have a duty to rein in spending . <p> On the other hand , conservatives need to talk truth to Trump about the entitlements that his present budget fails to address . Admittedly , the Democrats ' reaction to these proposed cuts in discretionary spending is just a foretaste of what they 'd do if Trump were to propose reforming entitlements . Regardless , if Trump wants to make a long-term impact on America 's fiscal stability , he must address entitlements within the next few years . <p> With that caveat , I 'm praising Trump for the good-faith incremental steps he 's taken with this budget . Let 's give praise where it 's due and constructively criticize when appropriate .

The gulf 's peculiar history gave rise to a landscape riddled with domes , pockmarks , canyons , faults , and channels -- all revealed in more detail than ever before by a new 1.4 billion-pixel map . <p> This striking view of the ocean floor off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas was created by a government agency you 've likely never heard of called the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ( BOEM ) . The bureau 's job is to manage exploration and development of the country 's offshore mineral and energy resources . Consequently it has access to all the survey data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-D seismic imaging to map areas of the Gulf they are interested in . This involves towing high-powered underwater air guns behind a ship . When the guns fire , they create sound waves that travel down and are reflected back up by the sea floor . Lines of underwater microphones pulled along the surface behind the ship record how long it takes the reflected waves to reach them , data that can then be translated into topography . <p> As you can clearly see in the image below , this data is much higher resolution than the best available map , which was made in the 1990s . <p> View Images <p> The feature known as Horseshoe Basin in the western Gulf of Mexico shows up far more clearly on the new high-resolution map ( right ) . <p> Map by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management <p> The strange geology of the floor of the Gulf is mostly caused by thick underlying layers of salt .

Later , as the basin became a gulf , the salt was covered with sediment deposited by rivers . <p> Because salt does n't compact under the weight of overlying layers like sediment does , it ends up being less dense than the sediment above it . Because salt also flows easily , it can deform and get squeezed , which results in blobs of salt pushing up into the layers above , making domes and ridges and faults . These strange , complex configurations are part of the geology that created the conditions that allowed vast oil deposits to collect . <p> Only a vague outline of this bizarre landscape was visible on the old map , which had a resolution of 27,000 square feet per pixel , actually quite good for the seafloor .

With the consent of the seven companies , the BOEM released the map to the public . <p> View Images <p> The Joshua Channel ( labeled channel-levee ) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico stands out clearly on the new high-resolution map of the sea floor .

Her body was found nine days later , buried in a shallow grave about two-thirds of a mile from her home . She had been raped twice . <p>  This is one of the saddest incidents I 've come across ,  South African President Jacob Zuma said May 18 . <p> Her fate was not as unusual as you would wish it to be . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 most violent nations . According to police figures , each year 800 to 900 children are murdered in South Africa , a nation of 54 million people . <p>  In terms of child murders , we see in a year what the United Kingdom sees in 10 years ,  says Shanaaz Mathews , who directs the Children 's Institute at the University of Cape Town ( UCT ) . In England and Wales , with a combined population of about 58 million , there are roughly 135 child murders a year , according to the U.K. 's Office for National Statistics . <p> In South Africa , some women hide their pregnancies and dump their babies soon after birth .  If you conceal the birth well enough , they 'll never be found ,  says Lorna Martin , a forensic pathologist who has performed thousands of autopsies in Cape Town ,  so we do n't know how many babies are being murdered .  Still , municipal workers sometimes find corpses of children discarded by the side of the road , or along riverways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leading a pilot project that examines the cases of all the dead children in the busy mortuaries outside of Cape Town and Durban , respectively the nation 's second and third largest cities . Their pilot study of cases in 2014 found that the rate of child homicide is substantially higher than what has been reported in police statistics . <p>  Every three or four months , there 's a story in the newspaper that they found a fetus or a baby abandoned in a dustbin somewhere , and the child died ,  says Dr. Chris Scott , a Cape Town pediatrician who participates in the death review process .  We are seeing several of those a month in our study . It 's a complete epidemic that no one 's speaking about .  <p> Perhaps that will start to change with the attention being paid to the Pieters case . The Children 's Institute , UNICEF and the national Department of Social Development , along with other groups , sponsored a two-day conference this week to find ways to reduce violence against children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time shocked the conscience of the nation , sometimes leading to protests . Yet after the initial shock from those individual incidents wears off , the problem has largely been shunted aside . <p> Responsibility for the prevention of child homicides is split between different agencies , meaning no single entity has embraced it as a priority or mission . <p> The pilot child death review panels being sponsored by UCT are specifically designed to promote cooperation among the various players . Pathologists and other doctors are brought together with prosecutors , police and social workers . They determine whether a child 's death was likely accidental or homicide . If it looks like murder , a prosecutor might instruct the police then and there to pick up the file and start investigating . <p> The panels are not just looking for murder . Many other causes of death involving young children should be preventable . By closely studying each case , the assembled experts can look for patterns and figure out how to keep more children from dying . <p> For example , after the panel in Durban found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put pressure on local authorities to address the problem of illegally-connected electric lines and to offer safety tips to parents . <p> In some cases where children died because of severe negligence , their siblings have been taken from the home .  They were removed because it was deemed to be too unsafe for them to stay where they were ,  Martin says .  That would never have happened if it had not been for this child death review process .  <p> Child death review panels first sprang up in the U.S. about 20 years ago in Missouri , driven by similar concerns about child abuse that resulted in homicide . There are now review panels in place in every state , which may be run locally but are generally overseen by state public health departments . <p> Their portfolio has expanded well beyond abuse cases , leading to improved policies and practices that have shrunk the number of deaths from suffocation and sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) .  We just understand the deaths better because we investigate them better ,  says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review and Prevention .  We have a pretty robust review program in the U.S. , even though there are no dedicated federal dollars to do this .  <p> Child death reviews are now standard in rich nations but are still highly unusual in the developing world .  What they 're doing in South Africa is one of the first times this has happened , especially doing it in such a systematic way ,  Covington says . <p> What the South African researchers have found is that most of the murders of children happen in two phases of life : newborns up to children under 5 , who are usually killed by adults , and pre-teens and teenagers , who are primarily killed by their peers . <p> Despite the nation 's liberal abortion and contraceptive laws , a study from UCT and the South African Medical Research Council last year noted that  there are numerous barriers that women encounter when seeking a legal abortion in the public sector ,  ranging from religious objections by health care workers to lack of trained staff to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dump them or otherwise kill them after birth .  There are so many mothers who obviously feel they ca n't get a termination and instead would conceal their pregnancy and conceal their baby and then murder the child ,  says Lorna Martin , who heads the division of forensic medicine at UCT . Such deaths are called  concealment of birth  by the South African police , not murder , which explains why police figures are lower than the murder rate found by the death review teams . <p> Neonaticide , or murder of newborns less than a month old , is mostly committed by the mother , according to the UCT/Medical Research Council study . Among slightly older children , the killer may be the boyfriend of the mother or may be the father himself , says Albert Fritz , minister of social development for the Western Cape province , which includes Cape Town .  It 's just impossible to believe that one human being , in many cases the biological father of the child , can do this to a child ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child murder plaguing South Africa . As young as 9 or 10 , boys are killing other boys , junior gangsters sent to kill off members of other gangs , either as part of turf battles or in an effort to kill off rivals ' younger recruits . <p>  After they move up in the ranks , then they must start to kill ,  says a homicide detective in Cape Town , who can not be identified by name because of his position .  Currently , I 've got four active cases where kids were murdered .  In one of the cases , he said , the suspects were 18 , 14 , and 13 . <p> Getting convictions , or even testimony from witnesses , is difficult , the detective says . If the shooter is under 15 , it 's practically impossible to prosecute him anyway , because children under 14 are considered incapable of criminal responsibility under South African law . <p> The horror of Courtney Pieters ' death has made the murder of children a subject of discussion and media coverage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zuma called the killing of women and children a  crisis  in the country . <p> Within the medical community , at least , the child death review panels has made professionals much more aware of the scope of the issues involved .

Three of the stalls have ratchets so they 're going to go flying back into the walls . Then I 've got forty stunt guys jumping out of the way . Paul Cameron has seven cameras working , two long lenses , two crash boxes , a handheld , a crane up on a roof , and a drone flying in the sky . So it 's a fun little stunt to start our Monday morning off . What could possibly go wrong ?

There 's a Plexiglas false-front of the bank , and , although we ca n't see through it , Mark can from the inside .

@@18657294 <p> As President Trump 's struggles have mounted , the overriding question in American politics has become  who 's still with him ?  We 've looked at what might make members of Congress , particularly Republicans , break with Trump . They are the ultimate deciders of how much of his agenda is passed , and even of his fate in any kind of process to push him out of office . We 've also looked at how voters , particularly Republicans , view the president and whether they are likely to stick by him . <p> But it 's kind of obvious to say that Trump 's standing depends on how Republican voters and GOP members of Congress feel about him . The more complicated question may be : How do those two groups make up their minds about the president ? What Trump does , first and foremost , but their decision-making is also likely to be influenced by how other major groups in the Republican Party treat Trump . <p> What are the major blocs of the GOP , outside of elected officials and voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science splits parties into three main wings : the party-in-the-electorate ( voters ) , the party-in-the-government ( elected officials and appointees ) and the party-as-organization . The  organization ,  in turn ,  is comprised of many groups . Think of Fox News , which conservatives and Republicans watch much , much more than other national news channels . Or activists ' groups such as Heritage Action , which tries to push the GOP away from social welfare spending ( Medicaid , Obamacare , etc. ) and keeps a scorecard of the votes of members of Congress . The Koch brothers run a network of conservative groups , both nationally and in states , so vast that Politico referred to it as a  privatized political party .  <p> You can describe the party-as-organization wing in a lot of different ways , and Trump 's success in 2016 , particularly in the GOP primary , suggested that journalists , political scientists and even GOP officials themselves may have had an incomplete understanding of how today 's Republican Party works . In 2016 , there was perhaps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump from winning the nomination , if it chose to do so . <p> That said , since Trump was sworn in , the party-as-organization appears to be strong . The president has largely not delivered ( or really even tried to deliver ) on his promises to provide  insurance for everybody  in his replacement for Obamacare or to or bring back factory jobs -- goals that linked Trump and some of his voters but did n't appeal to key constituency groups in the GOP organization . Instead , Trump signed on to both a health care bill and a budget that would reduce federal spending on Medicaid , as his party 's fiscal hawk wing wants , as well as a number of provisions to limit abortions , a passionate cause of religious conservatives . <p> So , after speaking with some political scientists and Republican operatives , examining the groups that spent the most money electing Trump and Republicans in Congress and looking at the president 's moves in his first few months in office , I came up with an informal list of six blocs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing . ( Along with listing and describing each bloc , I included a current Republican politician whose ideology resembles that bloc , just to help clarify the distinctions . ) <p> So if you 're looking for defections from Trump , watch these blocs . Here they are , ordered from most to least likely to break away from the president : <p> Many conservative intellectuals were in the Never Trump movement from the start . For Trump , these defections , if they happen , will not be surprising and perhaps are not all that meaningful either : He won the GOP nomination and the presidency while shunning the party 's wonks . <p> Why should the president care about these people at all ? House Speaker Paul Ryan , who controls the fate of Trump 's agenda , is close to this wing of the party . Some of his closest allies work at Washington think tanks . <p> This bloc , and all the others below , have said very few negative things about Trump . There is a big gap between the party 's think-tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other bloc . <p> But why might small-government conservatives be less than completely loyal to Trump ? Well , Trump is not truly a small-government figure . He has not proposed overhauling Medicare or Social Security 's retirement program , as these conservatives want . <p> Who is more likely to share their views ? Mike Pence . The vice-president was the leader of the Republican Study Committee in the House , which was the most rightward part of the House GOP until the Freedom Caucus came along . Small-government conservatives might get more of their agenda enacted if Pence were in the Oval Office . <h> 4 . Conservative business groups/Wall Street <p> Business conservatives almost always get their way in Republican administrations . Trump , like George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan , is pushing an agenda of tax cuts and eliminating regulations . So this wing of the party is fine with Trump so far . <p> On the other hand , Pence would almost certainly sign these same bills just as happily . If Trump is becoming an impediment to their agenda , key party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump so forcefully . <h> 3 . Religious conservatives <p> You might think that this group would be very pro-Pence and anti-Trump , since the vice-president is a devout Christian and the president is not . But white conservative evangelical activists really like Trump . He is enacting limits on abortion rights and Planned Parenthood , some of their core goals , although Pence would likely do the same . <p> But there 's one other reason why conservative evangelical groups might prefer Trump to Pence . Think about it this way : Would Black Lives Matter activists have more leverage in a Hillary Clinton administration compared to Barack Obama 's ? Probably . Pence 's conservative Christian bonafides , like Obama 's with African-Americans , ca n't really be questioned . Therefore , religious conservatives are in a place to make demands of Trump , noting that his intense support from white evangelical Christians is one of the main reasons that the president was elected . <h> 2 . Cultural identity conservatives <p> The anti-immigration , antiglobalization wing of the GOP needs Trump to remain office , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hard to imagine another Republican president , even Pence , employing Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller as top policy advisers , proposing a travel ban from majority Muslim-country countries or even considering a withdrawal from NAFTA . <p> Why might they turn on him ? In some ways , this bloc 's agenda is tension with all of the groups listed above , except for Christian conservatives . The party intellectuals strongly supported Trump 's decision for a military strike in Syria , but this group was more skeptical . Business conservatives do n't want the U.S. to leave NAFTA and favor more trade agreements . This group is more anti-free trade . Cultural identity conservatives may have nowhere else to turn from Trump , but their strong support for the president is not guaranteed if he starts governing more like a traditional , big-business Republican . <p> The simplest way to illustrate this : What would Trump have to do for Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity to start criticizing him regularly ? <p> Actually , we do n't have to guess . As Matt Grossman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Hannity and other conservatives on TV and talk radio started sharply criticizing George W. Bush near the end of his second term . Bush 's approval ratings were fading among conservatives , amid the struggling Iraq War and his bungled handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . And Hannity and other radio and television hosts were blasting Bush 's advocacy of a bill that would grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants . <p> In other words , Bush was already unpopular , and he was proposing an idea -- citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- that was more popular on the left than the right . Trump may want to consider this example before he starts touting , say , his daughter 's proposal to allow new parents six weeks of paid leave . Trump 's numbers are already declining , even among Republicans , and paid leave is an idea that liberals love and conservative activists really do n't . <p> Earlier this year , my colleague Nate Silver listed 14 possible scenarios for Trump 's presidency and suggested one possibility was for the president to shift left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another **38;839;TOOLONG , Arnold Schwarzenegger , who made the pivot after initially struggling in California . <p> Why could n't Trump do that ? Well , the various scandals around Russia have left the president desperately needing support from his own party . That support likely comes with strings attached : Trump needs to implement the policy goals of the party 's key blocs -- or they might turn on him , and he does n't have strong public support to fall back on . 
@@18657295 <h> The March Of The Penguins Should n't Be This Difficult <p> Some teams that win the Eastern Conference consider it bad luck to touch the Prince of Wales trophy . Sidney Crosby is clearly not superstitious . <p> Jeanine Leech/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images <p> It was n't easy , but the Pittsburgh Penguins kept their bid for a second-consecutive Stanley Cup alive on Thursday night , surviving the surprising Ottawa Senators with a double-overtime win in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals . On paper , there was little reason to think the Sens would pose much of a threat to the defending champs , let alone take them into the 85th minute of Game 7 . But that 's the way things have been for Pittsburgh all playoffs long . <p> It was the second series in a row that Pittsburgh has been taken the distance by its opponent , after Washington pushed them to seven games in the conference semifinal . To their credit , the Penguins weathered each onslaught ; they even outgunned the Sens by 45 combined shots in the East final , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Pittsburgh has also been living dangerously . Its even-strength possession metricsover the entire playoffs are not as good as they were during last year 's run to the Cup final , nor do they compare well with the postseason numbers of the Penguins ' upcoming opponent , the Nashville Predators . <p> The Preds did n't play particularly great hockey during the regular season -- they ranked 13th in SRS ( in part because brilliant defenseman P.K. Subban missed 16 games with an injury ) . But they 've saved their best work for the playoffs , where they rank second in possession rate ( Pittsburgh is 12th out of 16 teams ) and first in SRS2 ( Pittsburgh is second ) . Pittsburgh was better in the regular season , but Nashville 's been the hotter team of late . <p> So which situation would you rather be in , heading into next week 's series ? Intuition might say it 's better to be the comparatively less worn-down Preds , rolling with the more impressive postseason stats . But history suggests otherwise . Going back to 1988,3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalist had the better regular-season SRS , but its opponent had the superior SRS in the playoffs leading up to the final.4 Of those , the better regular-season team won the Cup nine times ( 64 percent ) . And that 's not even considering that the Penguins ' regular-season edge was slightly wider than the typical favorite 's , or that they 'll have home-ice advantage in the final . <p> If we 've learned anything about the Penguins these playoffs , it 's that they rarely make things easy . ( And if we 've learned anything about the NHL since 1998 , it 's that repeating as a champion is really hard . ) But a grueling , complicated postseason run is n't necessarily a handicap in the Stanley Cup Final , if you 've had a championship track record all season long . <h> Footnotes <p> In 1996 , the Pens ranked third and the Panthers ranked eighth , though the gap between the two teams -- 0.6 goals -- was just as big as the gap between Pittsburgh and Ottawa this season . <p> Playoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential for the regular-season SRS ratings of the teams they 've played , with a home-ice advantage adjustment to account for where each game was played . <p> The earliest season of data in Hockey-Reference 's indispensable game finder tool . <p> 14 other times , SRS from both the regular season and postseason agreed who the better team was ; those clear favorites won their series 79 percent of the time .

It appears that the saga is not over , however , as a recent report indicates that Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Kanter , claiming he is a member of a terrorist organization . Via AFP : <p> Turkey issued an arrest warrant on Friday for Turkish NBA star Enes Kanter , accusing him of being a member of a  terror group  , a pro-government newspaper reported . <p> A judge issued the arrest warrant after an Istanbul prosecutor opened an investigation into Kanter 's alleged  membership of an armed terrorist organisation  , Sabah daily reported . <p> Sabah daily added that the prosecutor would apply for an Interpol red notice -- to inform Interpol 's 190 members that someone 's arrest is sought and thus ensure their deportation -- to the justice ministry . <p> Despite the seriousness of this continued incident , Kanter does not seem worried .

18682921," Why ' Handmaid 's Tale ' costumes are the most powerful meme of the resistance yet <p> Earlier this week , 18 women dressed up in red cloaks and white bonnets , stood in pairs in the rotunda of the Texas state capitol , and began chanting ,  Shame !  in unison . They did n't stop shouting for eight minutes . <p> They call themselves the Texas handmaids . You probably first saw them back in March , when images of their original protest in Austin went viral . That 's when they sat silently in the Texas senate gallery , watching as lawmakers debated bills that would make it harder for women to get an abortion . <p> What you may not know is that their demonstrations , inspired by Margaret Atwood 's classic dystopian novel The Handmaid 's Tale and Hulu 's vivid TV adaptation , are slowly spreading across the country . <p> Women are holding sewing parties to turn yards of blood-red fabric into capes . They 're swapping ideas on private Facebook pages about how to stage protests . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up at state capitols or in other public places in cities across the country . <p> If the visually striking meme takes off , it could become one of the most effective acts of protest from the resistance . The sight of even a dozen women wearing the handmaid costume , while staying silent and keeping their heads down , offers a stark contrast to a group of mostly white men deliberating over what happens to their bodies . The imagery is practically made for the digital era . <p> The point , activists say , is to send a powerful message : We 're closer to a government that strips women of their bodily autonomy than you might think . <p>  The easiest way we try to explain it is that the handmaids represent a future where women are nothing more than their reproductive capacity ,  says Heather Busby , executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas .  Unfortunately , with the laws that are being passed , that future is not so unrealistic and not so distant .  <p> We 're closer to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think . <p> The idea to enlist Texas women as handmaids started with Busby a few months ago . She happened to see women dressed as the title character from The Handmaid 's Tale at South by Southwest . That was a marketing stunt by Hulu , the streaming entertainment provider that brought Atwood 's novel to the small screen . <p> But Busby then joked on Facebook about how someone should send the handmaids down to the capitol , where lawmakers had been busy introducing bills that would curtail abortion rights . Soon NARAL Pro-Choice Texas ordered white bonnets from Amazon Prime and a volunteer rented red capes . A small group of volunteers quickly drew up a plan . They liked the element of surprise in showing up at the capitol in costume -- and wanted to let legislators know that women were watching . <p> After that yielded local and national press coverage of the legislative agenda in Texas , activists around the country started reaching out to Busby for tips on how to start their own handmaids brigade . <p> You could argue that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere close to becoming the Republic of Gilead , The Handmaid 's Tale 's totalitarian , theocratic state that freezes women 's bank accounts , forbids them to work , sends them to re-education camps , and forces many of them to bear children for leaders and their wives . <p> TheNew York Times ' conservative columnist Ross Douthat argued this week that liberals are seeing the wrong parallels . On the same day , Times op-ed contributor Mona Eltahawy wrote that the Republic of Gilead already exists in Saudi Arabia , where women ca n't drive and may be imprisoned for disobedience . For her part , Atwood has said that nothing in her novel has n't already happened before in history . <p>  I still have a credit card , I still have a nice car , but I can feel the future here .  <p> For the volunteers who are deep into the work of creating and wearing the costumes in public , it 's not about whether they still have credit cards or the right to get a job . What they see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative , even authoritarian , men who 've vowed to defund Planned Parenthood and roll back reproductive health rights like abortion and access to affordable birth control . At the same time , those men plan to funnel money to abstinence-only education and vouchers for  school choice ,  which includes religious schools . <p> The fact that they 're led by Donald Trump terrifies these women . <p>  We have somebody in the White House who thinks it 's OK to grab women and do whatever he wants , and I 'm supposed to sit back and be cool with that ?  says Emily Morgan , executive director of Action Together New Hampshire , an activist group that emerged in the wake of Trump 's election . <p> Earlier this month , Morgan contacted Busby for details on how to create handmaid costumes . But instead of bringing women into the New Hampshire legislative gallery during a debate or hearing , Morgan and her co-organizers asked them to appear at a press conference calling for the resignation of Rep. Robert Fisher , a Republican who The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Reddit 's popular men 's rights  Red Pill  forum . The message board bills itself as a  discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men ,  and Fisher regularly questioned whether rape is real , according to TheDaily Beast . ( Fisher resigned later in the day following the press conference . ) <p> A sexual assault survivor with handmaids demanding Rep. Robert Fisher 's resignation , on May 17 , 2017 , in Concord , N.H. <p> Image : Granite State Progress <p>  Fisher and the Red Pill embody exactly what TheHandmaid 's Tale is a foreshadowing of or is a warning against ,  Morgan says .  Saying that we 're not there -- it 's sort of degrading to what 's actually happening to women .  <p> In the days before the press conference , volunteers made six costumes , but some of the women bowed out after learning the media would be in attendance . Morgan says they feared in-person and online harassment . Nevertheless , she thinks more women will step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and New Hampshire are sewing new cloaks so that activists in New England quickly have access to them for future protests . <p> The time-intensive , costly aspect of buying the bonnets and making the cloaks is one challenge to growing the handmaid ranks . There 's also the danger that different groups will splinter in an effort to launch the first nationwide demonstration . Morgan is moderating a private Facebook page to coordinate a national action . A similar page started by one of the Texas handmaids has close to 300 members . <p> The handmaids ' signature costumes are also a relatively obscure reference compared to pussyhats , the knit pink caps that have become a symbol of the resistance . But they 're also memorable even if you do n't know the origin . <p> Ane Crabtree , the costume designer for the Hulu series , says the outfit 's visual power is rooted in both the bright red color , which can signify blood , birth , and passion , and how the cloak conceals women who wear it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the body underneath the costume is oppressed . <p>  It 's an easy form of expression to say that everything 's been taken away and is being taken away , and it 's a real thing ,  says Crabtree , who is encouraged and inspired by people making their own version of the costume . <p> Deborah Marsh , a 65-year-old retiree who is one of the Texas handmaids , says people who get the reference often approach her on the street or in the capitol 's rotunda to thank her profusely for the act of defiance . Some , however , have seen the symbolism and do n't like it . Marsh says a few people on the street have had  outbursts  or called the women  pathetic .  <p> Joe Pojman , executive director of the anti-abortion rights nonprofit group Texas Alliance for Life , seemed to criticize the handmaids a few times , focusing on the fact that they 've used smartphones while silently protesting in the gallery , a silly point that Marsh feels makes their case about men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsh did n't expect was how confident she would feel while wearing the costume .  It 's such a bold costume , it 's making such a bold statement ,  she says .  And my body is inside that costume , so why would n't I feel bold ? Why would n't I feel empowered ?  <p> Among reproductive rights activists like Marsh , the Texas legislature is infamous for its anti-abortion legislation . In 2013 , the state passed a law that effectively led to the closure of dozens of abortion clinics , which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional last year . The Republican-led legislature recently voted to ban the safest type of second-trimester abortion and require hospitals and abortion clinics to bury fetal remains , including those from miscarriages that happen at home . Texas has already moved to keep Planned Parenthood from state and federal funding . <p> In other words , as Texas limits access to both abortion and reproductive health care like birth control , it 's easy to imagine a future in which women have little practical control over how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be limited to Texas either ; other Republican-dominated states are pursuing a similar agenda with regard to limiting access to reproductive health care , as is the Trump administration . <p>  I still have a credit card , I still have a nice car , but I can feel the future here ,  Marsh says .  If people are n't affected by it today , they are going to be affected by it in four yours . Texas is a little bit ahead of the game .  <p>  Am I going to change someone 's mind who is pro-life ? I do n't expect that . I 'm aiming higher . I want to change the culture .  <p> Stephanie Martin , a mom from Round Rock , in central Texas , who recently dressed up as a handmaid for the first time , says she 's realistic about who the message is going to reach . <p>  Am I going to change someone 's mind who is pro-life ?  she asks .  I do n't expect that . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  <p> It 's still early to gauge exactly how that culture will respond beyond the videos and photos that have gone viral . But the parallel between the male aggression and control that characterizes Gilead feels particularly fresh in a week where a Republican congressional candidate body slammed a reporter for asking a question he did n't like , and the president appeared to shove aside a European leader to get a better position in a photo-op . <p> Let 's not forget the complicity of Ivanka Trump , who promotes herself as a champion of gender equality but says nothing critical about healthcare and budget proposals that are arguably hostile to women . Nor can we ignore the benign-looking malevolence of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos , who could n't come up with a single instance of discrimination at publicly funded schools that would give her pause when asked about it at a congressional hearing . In Gilead , after all , the women who are not outrightly oppressed get the privilege of wielding what small power they have against the vulnerable and marginalized . <p> Morgan admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening today and Atwood 's fiction . Yet she urges skeptics to focus less on a dramatic , sweeping end to women 's rights . What 's more important , at this point , is the underlying implication of attitudes and laws that see no harm in making it more difficult or even impossible for women to determine their own fate . <p>  These are steps on the same path ,  she says of the parallels between Gilead and Trump 's America .

18689177," AUSTIN -- Texas ' top Republican leaders looked hopelessly deadlocked Sunday over must-pass legislation that , if not passed , would force an overtime that could cost taxpayers up to $800,000 . <p> There 's been no love lost this year between House Speaker Joe Straus and Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick , who heads the Senate . The two Republicans have wrestled over property tax measures and the so-called bathroom bill , which would restrict bathroom use for transgender Texans . <p> The latest legislative logjam comes the day before lawmakers are supposed to finish their work and head home for the next two years . If they do n't find an agreement , and fast , it could trigger a special session on the taxpayers ' dime . <p> The disagreement hinges on an arcane process called  sunset ,  in which lawmakers periodically review state agencies and decide to either phase them out or keep them open . Patrick says the House did n't complete its sunset review process in time . <p> The House disagrees , accusing the Senate of sabotage . Five agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Senate agrees to approve a House proposal pushing back their sunset date to 2021 , they insist . <p> All the Senate has to do is sign off , said Sunset Advisory Commission Chairman Rep. Larry Gonzales , R-Round Rock . But it wo n't , he said , because Senate Republicans want to force Gov . Greg Abbott to call a special session so they can revive the bathroom and property tax bills . <p>  The House has done its job on all matters sunset-related ,  Gonzales said Sunday at a news conference .  It is the purposeful inaction by the Texas Senate which puts us where we are today . <p>  It 's on them .  <p> Ken Levine , the Sunset Commission director , said the commission worked with the state 's nonpartisan legislative research agency to find a fix to keep the five agencies open . <p>  Sunset Commission staff was requested to work with Legislative Council on language that would continue the five agencies at risk , as well as their governing law ,  Levine told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News .  Staff did as requested .  <p> But the Senate says that fix wo n't work . <p> In their own news conference Sunday , called just after the House 's , senators rejected the solution the commission and council worked out . <p>  The fix the House sent us does n't work . It just does n't compute ,  said Sen. Van Taylor , R-Plano , vice chairman of the Sunset Commission .  The only way to fix this is with a special session .  <p> Patrick added ,  The gap between the real truth and what was said is about as wide as the Grand Canyon . <p>  I would suggest the next time they want to come and swing a bat at the Senate , they at least have their facts straight .  <p> Later Sunday , Taylor issued a statement further refuting the fix :  The House 's last minute Hail Mary does not conform with Senate rules nor the Constitution of Texas .  <p> The Texas Medical Association weighed in on the impasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the physicians or with the Texas Medical Board , and everyone at the Capitol knows that .  <p>  The TMB serves a critical state function , licensing physicians and protecting the health and safety of Texans ,  said Steve Levine , vice president of communications for the association .  We have no reason to believe that any of our state leaders want the TMB to go away , and we have every expectation that they will find a way to make sure that does n't happen .  <p> Only Abbott can convene a special session . But if the sunset bills are not passed , he would be forced either to call lawmakers back to Austin or let these agencies close in September . <p> The shuttering of the Texas Medical Board would mean the agency would n't be able to license doctors . Gonzales said this would seriously endanger Texans ' access to medical health and let certain practices , like abortion , go unchecked . <p> The regular session ends Monday , after which Abbott could call a special session at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated and could call lawmakers back for one or multiple issues . <p> Calling a special session could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars , depending on how long lawmakers take to reach an agreement . Such a session could last as long as 30 days . In 2013 , PolitiFact Texas estimated a one-month special session could cost $716,100 to $819,000 in lawmaker and staff per diems alone . That does n't include other costs related to continued use of the state Capitol .

The 21-year-old infielder is hitless in his last 21 at-bats , dragging his batting average down to .186 . The slump earned him two games in Bruce Bochy 's cooler , Saturday and Sunday . <p> Sunday might have been a mercy sit , Bochy sparing the kid his first exposure to a big-league knuckleballer , Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mini-benching , no tears from Arroyo . <p>  It 's kind of the point I 'm at right now . I 'm just trying to get back on track . I think the little slump that I 've been going though is good for me early in my career , just to learn how to deal with it ,  Arroyo said before Sunday 's game .  Obviously , I 've failed before . This is a game of failure , but I think it 's good for me to be going through this right now .  <p> I checked it out . Sure enough , Arroyo failed right out of the box , hitting .203 in 31 games with Class A Augusta in 2014 . He bounced back , finishing that season hitting .333 in 58 games at short-season Salem-Keizer . <p> Mays had manager Leo Durocher in his corner , bucking him up . Arroyo has , among others , Will Clark . They 've known each other since Arroyo was drafted in 2013 , and Clark worked with Arroyo as he advanced through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SOS text to Clark , asking if he would meet him for some early pregame work in the cage . Clark , along with hitting coach Hensley Meulens , helped Arroyo iron out a hitch or two . <p> One factor working in Arroyo 's favor is his swing . <p>  It 's sort of short and compact and not a lot of moving parts ,  Clark said ,  so it 's easy to work with . When you have a swing like that , once you get your swing down pat , all it is after that is just picking out a strike to hit , and a strike that you want to hit .  <p> Hitting is a head game , too . Arroyo does n't lack for confidence , but even the cockiest rookie needs a pat on the back . <p> Clark was a 22-year-old rookie in 1986 , got off to a good start , broke his elbow , missed 47 games , and had to fight his way back into the lineup . <p>  I would say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark said Sunday .  So some of the stuff he and I talk about in the cage , I talk about from experience . Now , looking back on it , it made me a better player , because when I came back , I absolutely was more aggressive . I 'm just trying to impart some of that wisdom to him .  <p> Arroyo is great fodder for debate among the Giants ' fans and followers . What should the Giants do with their slumping youngster ? Send him back to Triple-A to allow him to breathe and re-groove ? But would n't that break his spirit ? Or will a few more hitless games in the glaring spotlight crush his spirit even more ? Where will he be Tuesday , when he turns 22 ? <p> In the press-box lunch room Sunday , broadcaster Marty Lurie said he 'd like to see Arroyo in a utility role for now , keep him in the majors but remove the everyday pressure . Joan Ryan , a Giants employee and former Chronicle columnist , said no way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn and develop . <p> They agreed , as did I , that shipping Arroyo back to the minors is n't the answer . The Giants are convinced Arroyo has certified big-league talent , so there 's no gain in demoting him . <p> On the other hand , this is n't summer camp . The Giants are struggling , but they are n't ready to bag their season . They 'd like to make a run , and a power-position player hitting under .200 would be a liability . But the fact that Arroyo is still here despite his slump is an indication that the Giants believe strongly in him and are willing to be patient . <p> Two hours before Sunday 's game , Arroyo was at his locker , changing into his hitting clothes for another session in the cage with Meulens and Clark . <p>  I 'm going to get some good work in ,  Arroyo said .

18700906," Sometime in the next few weeks , four Democratic lawyers and four Republican ones will file into the ornate Lyndon Baines Johnson Room just steps from the Senate chamber at the Capitol to consider a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act . <p> They 'll sit at a long table before someone unknown to most Americans but with singular power to influence whether Republicans can follow through on their seven-year quest to remake President Barack Obama 's signature domestic achievement . <p> That person is Elizabeth MacDonough -- the Senate parliamentarian , who is charged with acting as Congress 's version of a referee in the contentious health-care debate . MacDonough and her small staff will decide whether the Republican-crafted bill sent over from the House meets the requirements allowing it to be considered under special budget rules designed to protect it from Democratic defeat . <p> Before MacDonough , Democrats will argue that the GOP measure known as the American Health Care Act ( ACHA ) bleeds over the boundaries of what can be accomplished under budget rules known as  reconciliation .  Republicans will insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions that affect federal spending . <p> MacDonough will listen carefully to both sides . She 'll ask questions . She wo n't appear to favor one side . And when she makes a decision , it will be based on her best understanding of Senate rules and precedent -- not on whether she approves or disapproves of the Affordable Care Act or the effort to repeal it , multiple friends and former co-workers say . <p> MacDonough 's rulings on past ACA repeal efforts suggest that she may side with Republicans in some instances . But the new GOP bill is different in that it tackles ACA repeal and attempts to replace portions of it . <p> MacDonough  is in my view completely unbiased and she cares about the institution and she follows the precedent that has been established ,  said David Schiappa , who for years worked closely with her as secretary for Senate Republicans . <p> Bill Dauster , a longtime counsel to Senate Democrats , said :  I 've always felt I could get a fair hearing .  <p> MacDonough declined a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who talk much but affect little . MacDonough is the opposite -- she intentionally stays out of the spotlight , but wields enormous influence in proceedings on the Senate floor , where she , her deputy and several assistants continually advise senators on arcane procedure and a complex set of rules that few people really comprehend . <p> MacDonough , who attended a preparatory high school in Connecticut and holds degrees from George Washington University and Vermont Law School , worked her way up in the Senate , starting as an assistant parliamentarian in 1999 and serving for 13 years before the Senate approved her as parliamentarian in 2012 at the recommendation of then-Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D-Nev . ) . <p> Observers say it is a stressful role , especially as the environment in Congress has grown more partisan and toxic . Although past Senate leaders have ousted parliamentarians for decisions they did n't like -- and the Senate majority leader has the ability to do the same to MacDonough -- the job is still widely considered nonpartisan . Part of being perceived as fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . <p>  My experience with her is that she is fair ,  said Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , who acts as the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee , which has had extensive interaction with MacDonough and her team .  She has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders .  <p> Don Stewart , deputy chief of staff to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , said the Senate is  fortunate  to have MacDonough 's guidance . <p>  The parliamentarian is a brilliant lawyer , a thorough and fair referee , and a walking encyclopedia of Senate precedent and procedure ,  Stewart said . <p> But the health-care debate into which MacDonough is about to step could challenge even her reputation for fairness . <p> A budget reconciliation bill needs just a simple majority in the Senate to be approved -- not the 60 votes typically required to overcome a filibuster . That permits Republicans to pass their health-care legislation with just 50 of their 52 members , with tiebreaking help from Vice President Pence . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pull them . Each piece of such a bill must be directly related to federal spending , such as a tax or expenditure . Repealing certain parts of the ACA , such as its taxes , for example , fits easily under this standard . But other parts , such as rolling back the law 's insurance regulations , do n't necessarily qualify . <p> MacDonough 's primary task over the next few weeks will be to rule on whether the AHCA qualifies as a budget reconciliation bill . If she finds that individual parts of the bill would n't have a direct budgetary impact through a process known as a  Byrd bath ,  those parts would be stripped out . That does n't mean , however , that the House would have to vote again on its measure -- just that lawmakers could consider only a pared-back version . <p> Most health-care experts think MacDonough will strip some parts of the House bill -- indeed , many House Republicans are holding their breath regarding some of the AHCA 's riskier elements . <p> The parts most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protections for people with preexisting conditions , or its provision raising the ratio for how much insurers can charge older people relative to younger ones . Those elements are insurer regulations not directly related to federal spending , but some Republicans have argued an indirect link by noting that premiums would be affected and therefore the amount of subsidies the government must pay out . <p> Another questionable part of the House bill is its language banning federally subsidized insurance plans from covering abortions . Abortion opponents insisted that such a ban must be included , even though that , too , might raise MacDonough 's eyebrows . <p> Republicans already have a sense of how MacDonough might rule . A year and a half ago , she and her deputies analyzed a measure aimed at repealing some of the ACA but not replacing it . Although Obama ultimately vetoed that bill , House and Senate Republicans passed it partly as a readiness exercise should they eventually win the White House . <p> Staffers writing that 2015 House measure did n't attempt to repeal large parts of the ACA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from conservatives , the Senate added provisions to eliminate the insurance subsidies , Medicaid expansion and small- business tax credits . Notably , MacDonough went along with those changes . <p> Heartening conservatives , MacDonough ruled that a section in that measure banning Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements could remain . The measure said Medicaid money could n't go to certain abortion providers , without explicitly mentioning the group . <p> Under her guidance , the Senate was forced to tweak language repealing the individual and employer mandates , technically leaving the requirements in place but eliminating the penalties . <p> There are those preparing preemptive plans should MacDonough disappoint them . <p> A few of the more conservative senators -- including Ted Cruz ( Tex. ) -- have suggested that McConnell could replace MacDonough if she rules against them -- or at least allow the Senate president to overrule her . <p> But that lack of support is n't widespread . Those who know MacDonough say they 're not surprised that she does n't give interviews or speak publicly because she takes her job as an unbiased adjudicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more expansive interpretation of budget rules say they are not worried about MacDonough judging health care . <p>  I have complete confidence in her ability to interpret Senate rules ,  said Michael Cannon , a health-policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute . <p> Cannon has argued extensively that virtually every part of the ACA is closely tied to government spending . <p> Cannon used to live in MacDonough 's neighborhood , and he says they 'd run into each other while walking their dogs . They also visited the same dentist -- once during an appointment , he saw her photo displayed on the office wall as a testament to great teeth . <p>  She 's got such a great smile , the dentist put her picture up in his office ,  Cannon said . <p> Paige Winfield Cunningham covers health policy and authors PowerPost 's daily tipsheet The Health 202 .

18710784," The most memorable moments of the 85th Texas Legislature <p> Oh , you were n't watching all 140 days of the Texas legislative session ? We 've got you covered -- with the best floor fights , the most dramatic moments , the most emotional speeches and , of course , a bill about  masturbatory emissions .  <p> Tears , jeers , shouts and pouts filled the Texas Capitol this legislative session . Bills died , others survived and some still remain uncertain . Here 's a rundown of the bests and worsts , the highs and lows from the 85th Texas Legislature . <h> Biggest floor fights <p> There were two skirmishes in the House this session that nearly came to blows . <p> Rep. Jonathan Stickland , R-Bedford , had filed an amendment to defund a state program for the abatement of feral hogs , which he 's become known for championing each session . He railed against the program , calling it  ridiculous  and a waste of money . <p> That offended rural lawmakers , notably Rep. Drew Springer , R-Muenster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've cut the same amount of funding for roads and highways in Stickland 's hometown . <p> Stickland took to the back microphone to cry foul . <p> State Reps . Drew Springer , R-Muenster , and Jonathan Stickland , R-Bedford , in a heated exchange over a feral hog amendment to the House budget on April 6 , 2017 . Bob Daemmrich for The Texas Tribune <p>  Someone else has chosen to make a mockery of this system and play gotcha politics ,  he said before being interrupted . Laughter had erupted in the gallery .  It 's funny until it happens to you ,  he added . <p> Springer and Stickland then confronted each other in the middle of the House floor and had to be separated by colleagues . After Springer 's amendment to Stickland 's proposal passed 99-26 , Stickland withdrew his own . <p> The second fight was far worse -- and it happened on the normally diplomatic and ceremonial final day of the session . But it echoed the biggest and most personal debate of the session : consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctuary cities  in Texas . <p> Hundreds of loud  sanctuary cities  ban protestors filled the House gallery , disrupting proceedings for a full 20 minutes . That 's when an angry state Rep. Matt Rinaldi , R-Irving , called immigration enforcement officials on them -- enraging his Hispanic Democratic colleagues , and allegedly prompting Rinaldi and state Rep. Poncho Nev ? rez , D-Eagle Pass , to threaten each other . Video from the House floor shows lawmakers from both parties pushing each other . <p> In a news conference following the altercation , state Rep. Justin Rodriguez , D-San Antonio , said Rinaldi had also threatened to  put a bullet in one of my colleagues ' heads .  According to other Democratic lawmakers , including state Reps . C ? sar Blanco , D-El Paso , Armando Walle , D-Houston , and Ramon Romero , D-Fort Worth , Rinaldi approached their group and said ,  ' I 'm glad I just called ICE to have all these people deported . '  <p> Rinaldi said in a statement after the encounter that Nevarez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his comments were made in self defense . He also said he was under the protection of the Department of Public Safety . In a tweet , Nevarez called Rinaldi  a liar and hateful man .  <h> Best ( back ) mic drop <p> On May 23 , state Rep. Harold Dutton , D-Houston , approached the back mic and said he was upset with the Senate 's inaction on several bills authored by House members . <p> Dutton , riling up colleagues , shouted ,  When the Senate wo n't respect us , they need to expect us !  The chamber doors opened moments later -- an effort for members ' calls to be heard across the Capitol rotunda in the Senate . <p> Dutton pressed the same button the next day . Standing at the back mic once again , he said he intended to run out the legislative clock on roughly 150 Senate bills placed on that day 's agenda for uncontested legislation . <p>  I do n't know if you 'd like for me to do them in a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow pallbearers to come up with me ,  Dutton said , later adding ,  should I bring the bills with me in the trash can , or should I just leave them here ?  <p> After a few minutes of discussion , several House members exited the chamber and headed to the Senate for a closed-door meeting with Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick and other senators . <p> Dutton called the meeting  productive .  And by all appearances , a deal had been made : House members flew through Senate bills shortly afterward . <h> Best act of persistence <p> Despite having her bill shot down three times by members of the House 's ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus , state Rep. Helen Giddings , D-DeSoto , continued to push to eliminate  lunch shaming  in Texas schools . During a personal privilege speech on the House floor , Giddings held up a sample of a piece of cheese given to students who lack money to pay for school lunches in Dallas area schools .  These children deserve better than what we 've done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which eventually was tacked onto another passing bill , local school boards would have to develop a grace period policy that ensures students without enough money in their school lunch accounts have some time to resolve the issue . <h> Tensest moments of the 85th <p> There were several , and most of them revolved around a single piece of legislation : Senate Bill 4 , the state 's  sanctuary cities  ban . <p> The Sunday before an anticipated Wednesday floor debate in the House on SB 4 , freshman Rep. Victoria Neave , D-Dallas , announced she was going on a hunger strike over the bill .  I want people to know how terrible this is ,  she said . <p> State Rep. Gene Wu , D-Houston , later broke down on the House floor , saying the bill was personal to him as an immigrant , and recounting the fear the proposal has stirred in his district .  This topic is painful for me because I 'm an immigrant . My parents are immigrants ,  Wu said .  I represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Gonz ? lez , D-Clint , asked lawmakers to vote down a  show me your papers  amendment to the bill that would let local law enforcement question the immigration status of people they legally detain .  If you ever had any friendship with me , this is the vote that measures that friendship ,  Gonz ? lez pleaded . The amendment passed into law . <p> When the bill made it back to the Senate from the House , Sen. Charles Perry , R-Lubbock , its author , took hours of questioning from his colleagues . State Sen. John Whitmire , D-Houston , asked Perry how he thought Hispanic citizens should prepare for future encounters with law enforcement , saying ,  You or I will never be questioned for our papers ... Would you not concur with that ?  Perry disagreed .  Sen. Carlos Uresti and I can pass for brothers , even though he may not admit it . I 've had people speak Spanish to me because I used to have dark hair .  <h> Most emotional personal privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Freedom Caucus ' intent to kill more than 100 local and uncontested bills -- payback , they said , for a failure to address key anti-abortion bills they wanted -- Springer broke down in tears . He begged colleagues to hear a bill on the calendar that would allow partial experimental cell treatment , referencing his wife , who has used a wheelchair for years after an accident . <p>  I 'll be damned if we do n't have the chance tonight to hear this ,  Springer said , choking back tears as colleagues surrounded him at the front microphone .  To know the apple is so close and I ca n't grab it .  <p> The House approved the bill shortly afterward , and on May 24 , the Senate voted out the bill . <p> State Rep. Drew Springer , R-Muenster , pleads for his colleagues to hear a bill on experimental stem cell treatments . Bob Daemmrich for The Texas Tribune <h> Biggest Capitol ultimatum <p> After the House Freedom Caucus delayed consideration of several bills , including a must-pass measure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper hand . Its version of that bill was still in play . <p> This led Patrick to give the lower chamber a public ultimatum : The Senate would only pass its version of the agency  sunset  bill if the House took action on the  bathroom bill  -- restricting bathroom use for transgender Texans -- and a property tax measure . If the House did n't , Patrick said , he would ask Abbott to call a special session . <p>  If we must go to a special session , I will respectfully ask the governor to add both of these bills -- plus other legislation he has voiced support for -- in that special session call ,  Patrick said during a press conference at the Capitol on May 17 .  If the bills do n't pass in the special and they 're blocked again , I will ask the governor to call us back again and again and again .  <p> Patrick 's threat came a day after House Speaker Joe Straus sent the lieutenant governor a letter noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its work on the budget and passed the  sunset  bill . <p> The House later approved property tax legislation but excluded provisions the Senate wanted , making it untenable in that chamber . It also tacked an amendment onto another bill that would 've allowed transgender students to use single-stall restrooms , locker rooms and changing facilities at public schools . <p> Patrick wanted more . He rejected the House 's proposals on both bills , and the two chambers never reached a compromise . <h> Most likely to leave the Lege behind <p> Several members from both chambers expressed interest in moving up or out after this legislative session , so there 's no clear winner in this category . <p> Meanwhile , Stickland suggested he might consider statewide office after U.S. Sen. John Cornyn was reported to be on the short-list to lead the FBI . Cornyn quickly pulled his name out of contention for that job . <h> Best bill caption <p> One legislator tried to shake up the health care debate with a bill that would fine men $100 for masturbating and let doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in refusing to perform an elective vasectomy or prescribe Viagra . <p> Titled the  Man 's Right To Know Act ,  the caption for House Bill 4260 by state Rep.

18712397," This year , Memorial Day was supposed to mark the last day of the 85th legislative session -- but not if Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick gets his way . <p> Patrick has repeatedly threatened a special session over the bathroom bill and the property-tax reform bill as the regular session has drawn to a close , and his position was unchanged at the last gavel on Monday afternoon . <p> He told senators he would see them  a little sooner  than the next session , in 2019 , and said in a statement ,  We will continue to celebrate these victories of conservative principles and governance and we will continue to fight the battles that remain -- particularly on property taxes and privacy , which remain ' must-pass ' legislation .  <p> All signs point to a possible special session -- at the cost of $800,000 to taxpayers . <p> House Speaker Joe Straus announced Friday that the House would not compromise with the Senate any further on these two issues , prompting dueling news conferences between him and Patrick over the weekend in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( worth noting is that both men are Republicans ) . <p> Patrick had first threatened a special session last week , saying that if the House did not pass the bathroom bill or property-tax reform , he would hold hostage must-pass legislation called a  sunset safety net  bill . Every so often , lawmakers have to review various state agencies in order to keep them open . But if those reviews need to be postponed , legislation is required ; otherwise the agencies have to close . One of five state agencies facing possible closure is the Texas Medical Board , which licenses all doctors in Texas . <p> Good luck finding a doctor in Texas if there 's no special session to pass the sunset bill , Patrick told reporters at a news conference Sunday . Even though the Senate had the opportunity to pass it , Patrick still blamed the House for the bill 's failure -- and vice versa . Straus and House members simply viewed the Senate 's failure to pass the sunset measure as Patrick 's way to force a special session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbott can call a special session and decide what bills will be considered during the session , and he told reporters after a news conference Monday morning that he will make that decision later this week . <p> The bathroom bill and property tax reforms notwithstanding , here 's a look back at some of the most high-profile legislation that made it through the Legislature . <p> 1 . Governor Greg Abbott signed the controversial SB 4 privately . Taking the win in a tight race for most controversial bill of the year , SB 4 gives street cops the authority to ask anyone -- including children -- about his or her immigration status while detaining a person for any reason . It also subjects sheriffs or police chiefs to a criminal charge and removal from office if they do n't honor ICE requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants . Two lawsuits have already been filed against the state claiming that SB 4 will encourage racial profiling , and police leaders from the largest cities in Texas have already bashed the law and supported the litigation . Abbott , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearful citizens , decided to sign the bill on Facebook live on a Sunday night . He gave no advance notice . <p> 2 . The Legislature took strides to address the state 's foster-care crisis . With an overburdened and underfunded Child Protective Services agency , and with some foster kids stuck sleeping in CPS offices awaiting placements because of a shortage of homes , Abbott made finding solutions an emergency item this session . What lawmakers came up with : expanding the system into a  community-based care  model , allowing the state to contract with nonprofit organizations willing to take over some of CPS 's case management duties and undergo training for how to handle kids with behavioral health issues . Reports that came out last year showed CPS was failing to check on thousands of the state 's most at-risk kids , and legislators expect these looming changes to alleviate some of the pressure on CPS caseworkers . <p> Children who are under conservatorship also are required to have medical exams within three days of any new placements . But Republican lawmakers managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately passed an amendment barring foster kids from receiving the shots during these required medical exams . The bill awaits Abbott 's signature . <p> 3 . Abortion . Lots of restrictions on abortion . Get ready for another potential court battle . This year 's abortion bill , Senate Bill 8 , was primarily pitched as a bill to ban and criminalize  partial-birth  abortions on the state level -- something that is already illegal on the federal level . But it also bans the most common second-trimester abortion procedure , in which doctors remove fetal tissue from the womb using surgical instruments . Despite medical experts ' testimony that it is the safest method for second-trimester abortions , conservatives call it  dismemberment  and say it is inhumane . Among other things likely to go to court is the provision to require hospitals and abortion clinics to find a way to bury or cremate all aborted fetuses , including fetal remains from miscarriages . Apparently Republican lawmakers did not get the memo that a federal judge has already blocked this practice when the Texas Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that court case is pending . Senate Bill 8 also bans the donation of fetal remains , even for medical research . The bill is now on Abbott 's desk . <p> 4 . The Sandra Bland Act passed -- but without addressing the problem with her arrest in the first place . Overall , the Sandra Bland Act is a good bill . It requires law enforcement to make a  good faith effort  to divert people charged with nonviolent misdemeanors to treatment facilities rather than jail if it looks as if the alleged offense is a result of the person 's mental illness , intellectual disability or substance abuse problem . The law makes securing a personal bond easier for mentally ill or intellectually disabled defendants . And it requires independent law enforcement agencies to investigate jail deaths . <p> But for being a bill named after Sandra Bland , the legislation does nothing to address what led to Bland 's being in jail in the first place : her violent arrest after she failed to use a turn signal . Bland was pulled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out her cigarette . The officer threatened to use a Taser on her as she questioned why he was grabbing and arresting her . Senator John Whitmire originally included a provision in the bill that would have banned arrests for non-jailable traffic offenses -- but he removed it at the urging of law enforcement groups . And even though authorities say Bland committed suicide in the Waller County Jail just a few days after her arrest , she did not have a history of mental illness , and so it is unclear if the bill 's provisions would have even applied to her .  What the bill does in its current state renders Sandy invisible ,  Sharon Cooper , Bland 's older sister , told the Associated Press .  It 's frustrating and gut-wrenching .  The bill awaits Abbott 's signature . <p> 5 . Lawmakers voted to bring the state 's voter ID law into compliance with a federal order . After federal courts found that Texas 's restrictive 2011 voter ID bill had a disparate impact on minority voters -- and that Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new voter ID law an emergency item . The bill mostly mirrors the federal order that fashioned new rules for the November 2016 general election , allowing people who did not possess a photo ID to still vote using other forms of identification , such as birth certificates , bank statements and utility bills . They could then cast ballots after explaining in an affidavit the  reasonable impediment  preventing them from having a photo ID . The final version of the bill , signed off on by both chambers over the weekend , makes lying on an affidavit a state jail felony . This compromise came after the House wanted to make it a misdemeanor and the Senate wanted to make it a third-degree felony . This bill also awaits Abbott 's signature .

At his side was a woman he had met days earlier . <p> That warm summer night , just north of Washington , held promise for the 18-year-old : The woman had said she wanted to have sex . <p> Lying in wait , 100 yards away , were MS-13 gang members . They knew the woman . And they 'd helped her plot the ruse to draw in Villagran Morales . <p> The assailants pounced as the pair arrived . They pulled him into the woods , fought him and stabbed him 153 times . <p> The brutal murder in June 2016 of Villagran Morales -- a cheerful , well-like landscaper who 'd recently moved to Maryland -- was one of five MS-13-related killings over 14 months in Montgomery County by a reinvigorated gang . Details of his death have been laid out in two guilty pleas from teenagers who took part . <p> Unlike other suspects in the series of county cases , who were recent arrivals to the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death was born and raised in Montgomery County .

After she led the victim to other gang members , according to prosecutors and court records , she stepped back , shouted encouragement and laughed . <p>  Even after the murder ,  Assistant State 's Attorney Robert Hill wrote in court papers last week ,  Ms. Alvarado showed so little regard for the life of her victim that she came back to the crime scene to show her friends the gang 's handiwork .  <p> Court filings in Alvarado 's case do not detail how she got involved in MS-13 , although make clear that she had become friends with members who lived near her in Gaithersburg . <p> Alvarado , the oldest of six children , left school in the ninth grade , according to court records filed by her attorney , Timothy E. Clarke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich shop and for a company that cleans apartments , the records state . <p> Before the murder , Alvarado was using cocaine and marijuana  to a significant extent ,  according to Clarke 's filing , a problem that led to her one previous arrest , on a charge of drug possession . <p> Clarke will ask for a prison term of 25 years .  Vanesa regrets her role in this criminal event and is certainly remorseful ,  he wrote . <p> Four others were charged in the killing . The youngest , Juan Gutierrez-Vasquez , 16 at the time of the death and charged as an adult , pleaded guilty this month , and awaits sentencing . Trials are pending in Montgomery County against Jose Coreas-Ventura and Josue Cuadra-Quintanilla . An attorney for Coreas-Ventura could not be reached . Ron Earnest , an attorney for Cuadra-Quintanilla , said his client is not guilty . <p> The Montgomery case against Oscar Delgado-Perez was dropped . Federal prosecutors charged him with immigration violations , to which he has pleaded guilty , according to court records . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , according to court records . That case is pending . One of his attorneys , Alfred Guillaume , declined to comment . <p> For the family and friends of Villagran Morales , the extreme violence of his death has made it that much more haunting . Four people close to him began a search when they could n't reach him for a day and now live with images of his rain-soaked body , which they found in the park before calling police . <p> Villagran Morales was born in a region of Guatemala near the Honduran border . His mother and father migrated to the United States , leaving him in the care of a grandmother . He came north in 2013 , said his mother , Bertha Morales . <p>  At least bringing him here , nothing will happen to him ,  she recalled telling her mother .  He 'll study and work and be safe .  <p> He crossed the border , made his way to his father 's home in Maryland , lived there , and then moved in with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to school for a while , but was more interested in working , and got a job on a landscaping crew . <p>  He always asked if I wanted to go back to Guatemala ,  his mother said .  He said he wanted to work here for seven or eight years , make some money , and then go back to Guatemala . He wanted to build a house , have a little farm .  <p> Outside of his job , he liked to work on cars , buy toys for his brother and play soccer . In early 2016 , after turning 18 , he told his mother he wanted to move to Maryland , where he 'd lined up a landscaping job that paid better : $1 more per hour .  I did n't want him to go , but he said it would only be for a short while ,  his mother said . <p> She drove him to Maryland in April of 2016 and he moved in with a cousin . He generally left for work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycled to a nearby store to buy juice or candy . It was at the store , his family believes , that he met Alvarado . <p> Within days , he ran into Gutierrez-Vasquez , Cuadra-Quintanilla and Coreas-Ventura , according to prosecutors who say all were members of a local MS-13 gang . The three asked if he was a member of a gang . <p> In a later interview with detectives , one suspect would say Villagran Morales responded by saying ,  Yes , but I 'm not going to tell you which gang .  He was asked if he could demonstrate hand signs for any gangs . Villagran Morales responded by flashing hand signs associated with the 18th Street gang , according to prosecutors . <p> The three said nothing then , according to prosecutors ' accounts , but grew angry , convinced they 'd come across a rival . <p> Prosecutors contend that one called the head of their local MS-13 gang , putting the call on speaker phone , where the leader  was enraged that the group had not killed Villagran Morales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told it would be taken care of the next day , according to prosecutors who allege that the gang members put in motion the plan to have Alvarado draw Villagran Morales to Malcolm King Park with the promise of sex . <p> Although he was only about 5-foot-2 , Villagran Morales was powerfully strong from weightlifting . He fought off his attackers , until their numbers overwhelmed him as he begged for his life , court filings show . <p> When he did n't return later that night or the next day , his family members and friends grew worried . They could n't reach him on his phone , began calling hospitals , and went to search the park . <p> Police and prosecutors said they have found no evidence that Villagran Morales was in a gang . They do n't know why he flashed the 18th Street sign other than perhaps in a naive effort to fit in .  Villagran Morales was not a member of a gang ,  Hill , the prosecutor , said in a recent court filing . <p> The teenager was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey . <p> That is one small comfort , she said . <p> Her son could be among the MS-13 victims buried in woods , their bodies never found , their parents never certain what happened . <p>  Some mothers ,  she said ,  do n't even know that their kids have been killed .  <p> The ride-hailing company confirmed Tuesday it has fired Anthony Levandowski , the engineer at the heart of a contentious trade secrets battle playing out in court between Uber and its competitor , Google 's Waymo.

But he also noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taoiseach , it would signal another stride forward for equality rights in Ireland . <p>  For people of my generation , there were no role models at all . Now to be able to have a young , able , good-looking gay man as prime minister of the country , it says to young people , ' you can be anything you want , your sexuality does n't matter , '  he said . <p> If elected , Varadkar would be one of two openly gay heads of state currently in office -- Luxembourg 's prime minister Xavier Bettel being the other . In the past , two other world leaders went public with their sexuality : Former Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and former Icelandic Prime Minister J ? hanna Sigur ? ard ? ttir . <p> Immigrant roots <p> Varadkar was born and raised in Dublin to mother , Miriam , a nurse originally from Waterford in Ireland 's southeast and father , Ashok , a doctor from Mumbai , India . The couple met while working in the UK . <p> Despite Varadkar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Varadkar himself has previously taken a controversial stance on immigration , once suggesting the deportation unemployed immigrants to combat rising unemployment figures . <p> In 2008 as his party 's spokesman on Enterprise , Trade and Employment , he said ,  Would there be a case at this stage for giving an offer to foreign nationals the opportunity to receive , say , three or four or six months of benefits , if they then agreed to repatriate to their country of origin and then forego benefits beyond that ?  <p> In his current leadership bid , he has not laid out plans for immigration and is expected to continue to work with current policies , many of which mirror its neighbor in the UK . <p> Nevertheless , it seems Varadkar has the backing of Ireland 's Indian community . <p> Prashant Shukla , Chief Executive of the Ireland-India Council told CNN ,  Traditionally Indians have tried to integrate themselves in their adopted countries very well ... and continue making outstanding contributions to their chosen fields around the world ... due to their sustained hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep rooted commitment to democracy . <p>  Perhaps , the same story is going to be repeated by Leo Varadkar in Ireland . This is a proud moment for his father , Dr. Ashok Varadkar and his mother Miriam , to see their son is contesting for the leadership of Fine Gael and ultimately for Taoiseach . Over 30,000-strong Irish-Indian community is interestingly looking forward to it .  <p> ' Taking Ireland Forward ' <p> In his leadership campaign ,  Taking Ireland Forward ,  Varadkar has promised to hold a referendum on abortion in 2018 , reform tax laws for the self-employed and repeal a controversial water charge -- while refunding those who have already paid . The fiscally conservative politician has also promised to clamp down on welfare fraud , invest heavily in large infrastructure projects and act as a champion for small business . <p> Dr. Theresa Reidy , lecturer in government at University College Cork says that it 's not policy that will secure Varadkar 's win , it 's his personality . Although his sexuality and youth has set him aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political debate .  <p> Reidy also said that Ireland 's political system rests on politics , not on its politician 's personal lives or their families . <p>  There 's no First Lady role -- or anything like it in Irish politics . The personal circumstances of individual politicians have never featured terribly strongly in public debates in Ireland . Families tend to take a backseat role ,  she said . <p>  He 's a vocal media performer , and is well able as a communicator with capacity to capture the zeitgeist .  <p> But as Taoiseach , Varadkar might be more constrained and have to move away from his maverick minister persona . <p> As Reidy said :  the consequences are much more significant when you are prime minister .

18724477," On Monday , the tea party-aligned sophomore legislator from Irving again made national news , this time for telling a Democrat he would shoot him in self-defense during a fracas on the House floor prompted by Rinaldi telling his Latino colleagues he had called federal immigration authorities to report protesters opposed to the new law banning so-called sanctuary cities . <p> ( A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that the agency  is not aware of receiving any calls related to this matter .  ) <p> The parallels between Rinaldi 's first foray into political controversy and his role in Monday 's scuffle speak to his hard-charging style and to the polarizing role that the Freedom Caucus , a recently formed band of 12 ultraconservative legislators , has played in state politics this year . <p> The incident is not likely to hurt his standing among GOP primary voters .

Loebsack listened more than he spoke while Simpson administrators voiced their concerns . <p> Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , or CMS , finalized new home health care rules for 2017 , claiming the regulations will improve the quality of life for Medicare patients and safety standards at elderly care facilities . <p> Simpson Memorial Home Administrator Shelley Wicks said the nursing home , which is a nonprofit organization , is suffering as a result of the new regulations . Wicks showed Loebsack a chart of how much Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regulations violations . <p>  You see the excessiveness of fines from month to month ,  Wicks said .

@@18725273 <p> Last summer , Rio de Janeiro put on an Olympic Games that should serve as a blaring warning siren to any potential host city stupid enough to want to pay billions for the rights to the Games . Before the Games had been out of town four months , Rio de Janeiro had to declare bankruptcy because they were $31 billion in debt . The power 's out and the medals are decaying . Shit is dire . It has never been clearer that hosting an Olympics is the most efficient way to bring economic ruin down on your city for three weeks of PR and the enrichment of a tiny circle of faceless middlemen , and for some reason Los Angeles wants to get in on the party . Get the hell out of here ! <p> L.A. is vying with Paris for the right to host the 2024 Games , and they 've been aggressively trying to nail down the rights to host . LA 2024 chairman Casey Wasserman went on Bill Simmons 's podcast back in October 2015 to push the party line . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway line , which mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials explicitly said would be part of their pitch to the IOC . L.A. also agreed to host the 2017 para-cycling track world championships on extremely short notice in an attempt to buff their credentials in the eyes of international sports bureaucrats . Despite their best efforts , the Wall Street Journal reported this evening that the IOC is favoring a proposal to saddle Paris with the 2024 Games and send L.A. the 2028 Games . Los Angeles has previously said they wo n't settle for the consolation prize in 2028 , and they are not backing down . One hopes the IOC calls the city 's bluff . <p> The case for L.A. is fairly simple : the hypothetical Olympics would be on the cheaper side since the city already has a wealth of existing facilities and complexes , such as the Lakers arena , UCLA 's campus , and the new Rams arena . Early estimates of construction costs put the bill around $5.3 billion , which the organizing committee hopes to pay for with TV rights money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of California would be on the hook for any cost overruns , but do n't worry . There will be innovation ! <p> Advertisement <p>  Our risks in terms of delivery are minimal at worst ,  said Casey Wasserman , an entertainment executive who is the chairman of LA 2024 .  The benefits are we get to harness the great creativity and innovation in L.A. , to help deliver the Olympics of the next generation .  <p> That 's awfully optimistic , considering that every single Olympics features cost overruns . Everyone who builds a new stadium predicts that their project will be the one that comes in on time and under budget and that never happens . After all , the Rams stadium just got delayed for a year because of rain . Cities get swindled into these deals because of shady promises like those Wasserman makes . While L.A. would n't need to build new facilities , the stadiums and grounds already in place would all need to be tuned up and that comes with plenty of risk for overruns . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for every major stadium overhaul , that says the Olympics will generate a whopping $11 billion for the city . Even if you take this at face value ( and you should not ! ) that is simply a best-case projection that elides all the facts about what hosting an Olympics has historically done to host cities . Every city thinks that they will be different and will be able to overcome the catastrophe of paying billions for the Olympics , despite a long track record of the opposite being true . It makes no sense to bank your hopes on everything breaking right when it never has . A wised-up bureaucratic structure and better PR will not save Los Angeles . These people should not be taken at their word . <p> Sponsored <p> As the anti-Olympics organization NOlympics notes , even under the rosiest of outcomes L.A. would still see a sharp exacerbation of economic inequality , a funneling of money that could be used for worthwhile projects into the pockets of a handful of rich bureaucrats ( do not forget that the IOC is a clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation plan . You do n't have to be a DSA member to see how past Olympics have disproportionately benefitted the already rich and powerful and steepened the gradient between the rich and the poor . The 1984 L.A. Olympics , frequently cited as the last successful Games , were not even the all-out success they are pitched as . A good deal of the 70,000 permanent jobs that were added were quickly eliminated after the Games . <p> L.A. does not need the Olympics . There is no dearth of tourism , no need to clog the city 's already choked-up transportation infrastructure even further . Los Angeles is already one of the most iconic cities in the world , and an Olympics would not take it over the top and make it a Super-Duper Mega Always Good Forever city the way that officials are pitching it . The value of a city is in the ways it can serve its citizens , not the size of the party it can throw for a class of corrupt bureaucrats disguised as a sporting event .

18737702," Two weeks into May , on a record-breaking 91-degree day , a handful of men and women gathered in a windowless conference room in a Planned Parenthood center in lower Manhattan ; they were there to learn about a little-known state abortion law that forces women in New York to give birth to babies who will die in their first moments of life . The meeting was led not by a representative of Planned Parenthood , but by Erika Christensen , 36 , and her husband Garin Marschall , 39 , self-identified  amateur activists  who are unrecognizable by name or face but whose story has been read by more than 2.4 million people . <p> Last year , when she was 31 weeks pregnant , Christensen learned that the baby boy inside her had stopped developing and would die nearly instantly upon birth , choking for air . Due to a previous brain injury , the force of a vaginal delivery could kill her , so doctors would have to perform a C-section if she brought the baby to term . The doctors recommended an abortion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors from terminating a pregnancy after 24 weeks -- except in instances where the mother 's life is in immediate danger -- Christensen had to travel out-of-state for the procedure . <p> At eight months pregnant , a few days after Mother 's Day 2016 , Christensen and Marschall flew to Colorado . If TSA agents told her it was n't safe for her to fly , Christensen had been advised to tell them she was six months pregnant with twins . The couple borrowed money from family and spent $10,000 out-of-pocket for a procedure that can cost up to $25,000 . Christensen shared her experience to Jezebel anonymously in a powerful interview with then-editor Jia Tolentino that attracted the attention of state legislators , activists , and women across the country who have shared the same burden . <p> In an op-ed recently published in Rewire , Christensen wrote ,  I lay on the table , looking up at the ceiling . My internal questions played like a tape over and over in my mind : Why am I here ? Did New York expect me to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die ? Since then , I 've tried to answer that second question . The only answer I 've come up with is : yes .  Despite this , Christensen considers herself lucky -- at least she could afford to go through with the out-of-state procedure . Low-income women are forced to birth babies that will die immediately , or will fight to live every day of their short lives . <p> Advertisement <p> Advertisement <p> One year later , the couple has chosen to put themselvesat the forefront of the fight to reform the law that forced them to flee the state like criminals .  I do n't think any of us are really thrilled to put ourselves out there like this ,  Christensen said to the dozen or so people in attendance .  But we 're now more angry than we are sad .  <p>  Nobody knows about this , nobody cares about it ,  said Marschall , as he led the group through a PowerPoint presentation about New York 's current abortion law .  There 's a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not on the radar , it 's not on the map at all .  <p> The New York state senate is scheduled to end its session on June 21 . If it ends without passing a reform , another round of New York women will be forced to endure the traumas that Christensen did .  Yes there are huge problems , yes Trump is literally driving the country over a cliff ,  Marschall said at the meeting ,  but this we can affect , and it could help people . And it could help people this year if it were able to pass .  <h> New York 's Abortion Law <p> There 's a common misconception that New York , a bastion of progressive politics , is a safe haven for abortion rights .  Many , many New Yorkers , legislators , and people on the street just assume New York state has good reproductive health laws because we 're a progressive blue state ,  said New York State Sen. Liz Krueger in a phone interview with Jezebel days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the first in the country , the law we passed , by modern standards , was pretty lousy law .  <p> Early-term abortions were legal under common law in America until the 1800s , when anti-abortion physicians sought to increase birth rates among white , Protestant women and to maintain their power in the medical establishment as it opened up to women . New York criminalized abortions in 1828 , entering an  abortional act  into its penal code , alongside homicide and manslaughter . <p> Except in instances where it was deemed necessary to save the mother 's life , abortion remained a punishable crime through the 1960s . But as public pressure from activists and feminists grew , in 1968 New York 's Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller asked a commission to review the abortion ban . When a reform bill came to a vote in the General Assembly on April 9 , 1970 , New York 's lawmakers were split on the issue . <p> Advertisement <p> Sponsored <p> Assemblyman George Michaels , a pro-choice Democrat who represented a rural , conservative county in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote with his  hands trembling ,  according to the New York Times .  I realize , Mr. Speaker , that I am terminating my political career , but I can not in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that defeats this bill ,  said Michaels .  I ask that my vote be changed from ' no ' to ' yes . '  Michaels 's vote did indeed end his decade-long political career , but it paved the way for legal abortion access , turning New York into the first state to legally provide abortions to both out-of-state and in-state residents . <p> The New York state law that Michaels helped pass , which stands today , revised the penal code to create an exception for a  justifiable abortion  as one that a doctor provides within 24 weeks of a woman 's pregnancy or in instances when the woman 's life is at risk . For three years , New York was the nation 's leader on abortion rights . Then , with the passage of Roe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rendering the state law moot -- or so it seemed . <p> Advertisement <p> The state law technically makes providing an abortion after 24 weeks a Class D felony , punishable by up to two to seven years in prison , and makes self-induced abortions a misdemeanor crime . By specifying  duly licensed physicians ,  the law also deters certified midwives , nurse practitioners and physician 's assistants from providing first-term abortions , even though they are qualified to do so and play a big part in increasing access to early care .  There 's a direct conflict between New York state law and constitutional law ,  said Katharine Bodde , policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union .  That means that women like Erika are being sent out of state if they can afford to go out of state , or are being forced to carry a doomed pregnancy to term ,  she said .  Which is pretty cruel .  <p> According to the Guttmacher Institute , only seven states -- California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with Roe v. Wade . New York is unique because , out of the four states that legalized abortion pre-Roe v. Wade , it 's the only state that has n't revised the law . <p> The penal code also criminalizes self-induced abortions .  Having a law that directly criminalizes self-induced abortion is extremely rare . Only seven states have such laws ,  said Farah Diaz-Tello , an attorney with the Self-Induced Abortion Legal Team .  These are mostly hold-over laws from Roe .  However , the state rarely prosecutes women for self-induced abortions because it 's difficult to prove what ended a pregnancy ( the last arrest for self-induced abortion that Diaz-Tello recalls happened in 2011 , but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the case over lack of evidence ) .  If Purvi Patel had been in New York , she also would have been criminally prosecuted ,  she said , referring to the Indiana woman who was convicted of feticide after self-inducing an abortion in 2013 ( though , Diaz-Tello notes , the degree of the crime would have been different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York is  long overdue in addressing ,  she said . <p> Advertisement <p> In theory , constitutional law supersedes New York state law , and in 2016 , New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declared that  New York 's criminal law can not penalize reproductive health decisions protected by the U.S. Constitution .  However , even with Schneiderman 's assurance , risk-averse hospitals adhere to state law and reserve the right to terminate hospital privileges or fire doctors doctors who violate it , said Dr. Stephen Chasen , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College and maternal fetal specialist who takes care of high-risk pregnancies like Christensen 's . Chasen has been championing abortion rights in New York since he offered expert testimony challenging the partial birth abortion ban in New York in 2004 . While a hospital might provide special , case-by-case approval to perform a late-term abortion , the process can be too lengthy when a woman 's health is deteriorating . The gap between the state law and the federal law is  a black line , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About two-thirds of abortions take place in the first trimester of pregnancy , and nearly 99 percent happen before the 20th week . According to the the Guttmacher Institute , it 's unclear how many of the 1.3 percent of abortions that happen after 20 weeks are due to health risks or fetal abnormalities that arise late in the pregnancy , but a majority of women receiving late-term abortions learn about their pregnancies late and face more hurdles in accessing abortion than women who receive them in the first trimester . Studies have found that 47 to 95 percent of women may chose to terminate their pregnancies after a major genetic of fetal anamoly is detected in the second trimester ( demographic differences between the populations studied likely account for the wide range ) . <p> Advertisement <p>  If you 're talking about an uncomplicated pregnancy , 24 weeks might be a reasonable place to draw the viability line and say that in general , a baby born alive after 24 weeks with aggressive neonatal care has a good chance of survival ,  said Chasen .  But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  Chasen adds , too , that a fetus can survive in utero with a lethal fetal abnormality -- like a fetus without a kidney or a heart -- but can not survive beyond the womb , or survive with a reasonable quality of life . <p> In some cases , delaying the removal of the fetus in a complicated pregnancy can also cause health problems for the mother . For example , if a woman breaks her water in the second trimester before there 's amniotic water around the fetus , the fetal lungs will not develop . The woman might stay pregnant with a fetal heartbeat , but every day that a woman stays pregnant , she 's at risk of getting a bacterial infection of the blood called sepsis , which increases the risk of her health , Chasen explains . But the state law prohibits Chasen from terminating the pregnancy until he determines that his patient is lying at death 's doorstep , which is hard to predict .  A woman can go from her health being at risk to her life being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walking towards the edge of a cliff .  You do n't know when you 're over the cliff until you 're over the cliff .  Chasen says that New York 's state law directly impedes his ability to provide urgent and critical care to his patients .  It makes no sense . It goes against everything you think you are as a physician ,  he said . <p> Advertisement <p> There are no statistics on how many women require abortions due to complicated pregnancies in New York . But it 's uncommon for Chasen to go more than a few months without seeing patients with severe fetal abnormalities like Christensen 's .  Being an abortion provider is not a separate thing from maternal fetal medicine specialist ,  he said .  A general surgeon does n't have to lobby to be able to take out a gall bladder the way he or she thinks it 's safest and when he or she thinks it 's safest to do .  <h> The Reproductive Health Act <p> The solution exists in The Reproductive Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to date with Roe v. Wade . First , it would decriminalize abortion ( including self-induced abortion ) by moving it to New York 's health code . It would also permit licensed abortion providers to terminate pregnancies after 24 weeks when deemed medically necessary .  The Reproductive Health Act would help us act on behalf of the woman 's health ,  Chasen said . <p> The bill traces its origins back to former Gov . Eliot Spitzer , and has since gone through multiple revisions that have stalled in the state legislature . The latest version of the RHA , cosponsored by Krueger and Democratic Conference Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins , passed the Assembly in January . It now sits at the footsteps of the Republican-controlled senate . Krueger , who witnessed Republicans sweep the midterm election and ramp up their assault on reproductive rights in 2010 , assembled the New York State Bi-Partisan Pro-Choice Legislative Caucus to educate lawmakers about abortion rights and choke support for anti-choice bills as they were drafted .  I decided that in New York , we needed to play offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .  I 'm proud to say that in a country where even blue stateshave been passing anti-choice bills over the last six years , none of those have made any traction or moved in the New York State legislature .  <p> Advertisement <p> But with the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-majority Congress , there 's a new sense of urgency to pass reform -- and more at stake if it fails .  In the era of Trump , Roe v. Wade could be overturned ,  she said . What Krueger envisions as a likelier scenario , however , is that Republicans will  go statehouse by statehouse  and  pass terrible bills that cut away at protections of Roe v. Wade  -- even more aggressively than they 've been doing since 2010 . If those laws are challenged and win in the court , they will be the new precedent , she says ,  that technically supersede Roe v. Wade .  <p>  At that time , after the first one hits and we lose , even saying Roe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then all we 'll be left with , in New York state , is this 1970 statute that in certain circumstances , your doctor is n't going to go to jail for performing abortions ,  she said .  That 's not a reproductive health law . <p> Advertisement <p>  I think it 's really important for people to understand that we have a lot of smoke and mirrors instead of a solid statute ,  she continued .  And you can go to red states statutes in the country and find far better laws on their books than you can in New York .  <h> Effect On Women <p> Planned Parenthood , the National Institute for Reproductive Health , and the NYCLU are among several organizations that have been lobbying for the RHA for years , with little success .  One of the things we kept hearing in the senate over and over again was , ' Show me a woman who ca n't get an abortion in New York state , '  said Bodde , adding that the response  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between what was happening on the ground and our policy makers .  <p> Advertisement <p> The NYCLU has been gathering stories of women and girls affected by the law for years : In one tragic case , a 12-year-old girl was sexually assaulted . Her parents did not learn that she was pregnant until she was at 26 weeks -- past the state limit to receive an abortion , which makes no exceptions for rape or incest .  She was a tiny girl with anemia , and she faced health risks if she were forced to carry her pregnancy to term and deliver vaginally ,  the report notes .  But a C-section would also be a health risk . It would likely weaken her uterus and jeopardize her ability to have children later in life . Termination was the best course , but now it was n't available to her in New York .  <p> Another woman discovered that the fetus had polycystic kidney disease at 20 weeks . Further testing was required , but then Hurricane Sandy struck and shut down the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with life , it was too late for her to get an abortion in New York state . Unable to afford to travel and pay for the procedure , she was forced to deliver a still birth , further jeopardizing her health . During delivery , she suffered a hemorrhage that could have killed her . Thankfully , she survived . <p>  We collected these stories , and it 's certainly really difficult -- there are so many reasons why a woman would n't want to have her story published , and we ran into that a lot ,  said Bodde . But then , through the Jezebel interview , Bodde found Christensen and Marschall .  I can go into an office and I can talk until I 'm blue in the face , but it changes it so much when a woman like Erika and her husband Garin walk into a room and share their story ,  she said .  There have been several moments where legislators have actually gotten emotional because of Erika and Garin sharing their story .  <p> Advertisement <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , with a focus on the budget for the first three months . This schedule gives activists just three months to aggressively lobby lawmakers and pressure them to bring the RHA to a vote . Christensen , Marshall , Bodde , and others are turning up the heat . The couple recently launched a social media campaign and website to raise awareness about the RHA . The NYCLU has circulated a petition.Christensen has rounded up stories from other women and presented them to senators . <p> In one such story , Moira* , 36 , did not realize her pregnancy was at risk until an ultrasound revealed that her baby boy 's brain had stopped growing and was filled with fluid at 26 weeks .  I 've always considered myself pro-choice , but to be honest , there was a part of me that , for all my adult life , thought that by the time you 'd be at 26 weeks you 'd know if something was wrong ,  she told Jezebel .  I thought that a late-term abortion was for someone who has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true .  <p> Advertisement <p> The prognosis was microcephaly and hydrocephalus -- traumatic brain injuries that , according to doctors , would leave her son with severe disabilities . Moira was told her baby would be  lucky  to live beyondfive years old . Doctors advised an abortion , but by law , Moira could n't receive one in New York . So at the 28th week of her pregnancy , Moira and her husband flew to Albuquerque , New Mexico , for the procedure .  It feels like a you 're a criminal . Like you 're doing something outside the law ,  she said . The flight , rental car , hotel stay , and procedure cost the couple about $12,000 . None of it was covered by insurance . <p>  My moral compass says that that 's not right and that I had to take this pain and sadness so that my son would n't have to live trapped in a broken body ,  Moira said .

Might I recommend , for therapy , if something traumatic has happened to you , say it out loud to people 300 times . And then it actually starts to lose a lot of its power !  Christensen joked . <p> Advertisement <p> She recalled that one Republican senator 's aide told her ,  ' We ca n't support this bill because they said podiatrists would be giving abortions . ' This is what we 're dealing with ,  she said .  Literally , another one said to us : so she could just get an abortion for a headache at 30 weeks ?

I believe there are multiple Republicans who may not go on the bill as co-sponsors , but if it comes to a vote on the floor , will in fact vote for the bill . But we 've get to get it to the floor ,  she said . <p> Advertisement <p> Advertisement <p> This point is crucial : the bill can not reach a vote if it 's not brought to the floor .

He made it very clear that  he would not support this bill ,  Christensen said . <p> So with time running out , what 's the next move ?  To get a vote on the RHA this session would take the Governor using his skills and political muscle to pressure Sen. Flanagan to bring the bill to the floor ,  Krueger said via email .

They found a fixer-upper and spent six months putting up drywall , sanding and painting walls , and rebuilding a staircase .

Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg will operate at currently scheduled levels . <p> Long-Distance Service : The Crescent , between New York City and New Orleans , will originate and terminate in D.C. , with connections north provided on other Northeast Corridor trains . <p> Changes to Empire Service , between NYC and Albany , Buffalo and Niagara Falls , have yet to be announced . <p>  While we regret that this work requires some reduction in train service and disruption to passengers over the summer months , we believe it will ultimately be worth the investment in terms of increased reliability of passenger rail travel ,  said Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman in a statement . <p> Asked to comment on the decision to extend repairs to eight weeks , an Amtrak spokeswoman said that ,  We are still working on final details which we will announce as soon as we are able to do so ,  adding ,  I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns Penn Station jointly with the federal government , leasing track space to the LIRR and NJT . The spokeswoman deferred to LIRR and NJ Transit for details on their specific schedules . <p>  We have n't announced details of the LIRR service plan yet but stay tuned for an announcement soon ,  said LIRR spokesman Aaron Donovan . <p> NJ Transit did not immediately respond to a request for comment , though the NY Times reports that all Morris &amp; Essex trains will be diverted to Hoboken Terminal during repairs , where riders will switch to the PATH train or take a ferry over to Manhattan . Changes to other NJ Transit lines are expected early next month , according to the paper . <p>  This is basically replacement work ,  Michael DeCataldo , Vice President of Amtrak Operations East , told Gothamist last week .  Really no new technology is going in . It 's just replacing something that 's been in the ground for 20 or 25 years , if not longer .

18738651," When President Trump posted a misspelled  unpresidented  tweet , Merriam-Webster tweeted a definition of  huh .  <p> During the presidential campaign , Trump said it was a great  honer  to win a February 2016 debate . So Merriam-Webster defined that word as  one that hones .  <p> When Trump called Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) a  leightweight chocker ,  the dictionary mocked him by trying to define the two misspelled words . For  leightweight ,  Merriam-Webster said ,  We have no. idea .  For  chocker ,  -- well , how do you define  nope  ? <p> Merriam-Webster has gained online fame for trolling Trump ( as a candidate and as president ) . Its use of wit and humor has earned it nearly half a million followers -- up from about 180,000 when its social-media strategy was confined to a  Word of the Day  tweet in the morning and a quiz in the afternoon . Now , Trump-trolling tweets immediately go viral , including the most recent one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Despite the constant negative press covfefe  <p> Whoever was handling Merriam-Webster 's Twitter account apparently woke up in the wee hours of Wednesday and checked Twitter . This time , though , the dictionary did n't jab at Trump . No correction of the confusing word . No definition of  huh  or  nope .  <p> In an email to The Washington Post , Peter Sokolowski , Merriam-Webster 's editor at large , said  covfefe  was a typographical error , but people still turned to the dictionary to look up the definition . <p>  We do n't typically collect evidence for typos ,  Sokolowski said .  It 's more helpful to give spelling suggestions for similarly spelled words as an answer in our online dictionary ( for example , looking up tomorow will bring up a suggestion for tomorrow ) . Looking something up in the dictionary is evidence of curiosity , and there was certainly a lot of curiosity about covfefe .  <p> Meghan Lunghi , a spokeswoman for Merriam-Webster , confirmed that the tweet , sent about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  covfefe .  <p> Asked whether it was part of Merriam-Webster 's social-media strategy of using humor and personality on Twitter , Lunghi said :  Twitter is a medium that emphasizes wit and speed but also one that gives unusual importance to word choice and spelling . Because a limited number of characters can be used , the language of Twitter is both concentrated and exaggerated .  <p> Merriam-Webster has changed its social-media strategy so that its online persona reflects the quirky and geeky personality of its staff , Lisa Schneider , chief digital officer and publisher , told The Post in December . <p> That appears to have paid off . Almost every tweet trolling Trump and his aides gets shared thousands of times . <p> The post defining  feminism ,  tweeted after White House counsel Kellyanne Conway said she could n't identify with it because it 's too anti-male and pro-abortion , was retweeted 18,000 times . <p> The tweet about  fact ,  posted after Conway conjured the phrase  alternative facts ,  was retweeted 49,000 times . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  whispers into the void ,  conveying a sense of frustration in trying to explain what a  fact  is . That was retweeted 26,000 times . <p> The most recent one in response to  covfefe  has been retweeted 74,000 times as of Wednesday afternoon . <p> Surprisingly , Merriam-Webster said  covfefe  was n't Wednesday 's word of the day . <p> Comments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments , as are comments by users with these badges : .
