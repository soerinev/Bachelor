18216117,CNN,"There is no vote scheduled and it's unclear if there will be one before the House leaves for a week-long break Friday. There is a lot of talk and significant pressure from the Trump administration to act -- Vice President Mike Pence, who has been working with congressional leaders from the start on the health care effort, headed to Capitol Hill as well to lobby lawmakers.
Pence will spend much of Tuesday on Capitol Hill as well. He will meet with Senate Republicans for lunch, then meet with lawmakers during the afternoon.
Yet, President Donald Trump, whose White House was optimistic the House could pass a bill Wednesday, once again muddied the waters by suggesting the measure may still be changed.
The Republican Party can only afford to lose 22 votes assuming all of the Republicans are able to attend the vote and no Democrats cross over. As they count votes, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was expected to be out for three to four weeks after surgery, is returning CENSOREDfrfrfr office said.
Most notably Monday, Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee, announced he was opposed to the legislation. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Daniel Webster of Florida and Chris Smith of New Jersey will also vote against the current bill, making their decisions public in succession Monday afternoon.
Heading into a Republican whip meeting Monday afternoon, some of the members going in still did n't know how they would personally vote for the health care bill: Reps. Kevin Yoder, David Valadao, Erik Paulson, Elise Stefanik, and Adam Kinzinger all were undecided.
Rep. Patrick McHenry, chief GOP deputy whip, told reporters that he had no predictions on when and if a bill would come up this week.
But asked how close they were, he said """" very. """"
The hope is that leadership can sell moderates on the fact that this bill is going over to the Senate where it might be significantly reworked. CENSOREDfrfrfr talking to members in the Senate about changes he'd like to see. <h> Pushing forward
As hard as it is, Republican congressional leaders know they ca n't simply abandon their effort now.
"""" I hope we keep going. I do n't think we can stop, """" said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Republican who serves on the House's Energy and Commerce Committee told CNN last week.
"""" I think we do, """" Cohn told CBS. """" This is going be a great week. We're going to get health care down to the floor of the House. We're convinced we've got the votes and we're going to keep moving on with our agenda. """" <h> Pre-existing conditions
The fight over how pre-existing conditions are covered is at the center of the fight.
Trump said Sunday the White House is pushing forward, and that the GOP plan """" guarantees """" coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions.
"""" Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I CENSOREDfrfrfr,' """" Trump said on CBS's """" Face the Nation """" Sunday.
Pressed further, Trump said that """" we actually have a clause that guarantees """" coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Trump also said the health care legislation is """" changing. """"
Unlike the mandate under Obamacare, however, under the GOP bill insurers could charge them higher rates than others in the plan if they allow their coverage to lapse.
Republicans might seem stuck in a never ending cycle of trying to please the moderate and conservative wings of their party but pressure from the White House to deliver a legislative win for Trump is real. Also real: the repeated pledges to their constituents over the past seven years to repeal and replace Obamacare if given the chance. <h> MacArthur amendment not enough?
Last week, Republicans seemed to reach a major breakthrough.
A new amendment sponsored by moderate leader Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey gave states the ability to opt out of more Obamacare regulations. The amendment CENSOREDfrfrfr Caucus on board.
But the amendment, which experts noted could drive up the cost of insurance for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions, spooked moderates and left some -- who had been supportive of the legislation before -- scrambling to publicly voice their discontentment. All of a sudden, it was moderates in the hot seat.
It seemed that even though leadership may have gained upwards of 30 new votes from the Freedom Caucus, they were suffering significant enough losses from the other side of the party that they still could n't bring a bill up to the floor for a vote in order to mark Trump's first 100 days in office.
This week, leadership's focus remains trying to help those moderates get comfortable with the new MacArthur amendment. Over the weekend, House leaders, as well as Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, spoke with members hoping to flip enough votes to move the bill forward. Leadership aides emphasize that there is n't much room to change the CENSOREDfrfrfr trying to get members to keep the process in perspective.

18229187,CNN,"House Speaker Paul Ryan can only afford to lose 22 votes from the Republican side
The White House is piling pressure on House leaders for a vote
Washington ( CNN ) House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that the leadership still does not have the votes to pass the current bill to repeal and replace Obamacare -- but Republican leaders and the White House are not giving up and things remain extremely fluid.
Ryan told his rank-and-file members in a closed-door conference meeting that when the votes are there, he will put the bill on the floor, in an implicit admission that the majority of 216 votes that he needs to ensure passage is not yet in place, one member inside the meeting told CNN.
President Donald Trump, at an event for the Air Force Academy football team, said Tuesday """" I think it's time now """" for a vote on the bill.
But at least 22 CENSOREDfrfrfr CNN's ongoing whip count. Influential Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, a former chairman of the House panel that oversees health care issues, said Tuesday he is against the measure.
Sources said House leaders are working with members one-by-one to get the votes they need to get to 216. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is going through the fine print of the latest version of the bill with undecided members to try to assuage their concerns on specific items.

Kimmel chokes up over newborn's health01:59
"""" The President ca n't do this, """" a Republican close to the talks said. """" This is fine print time. """"
As for timing, a senior Trump administration source told CNN's Dana Bash that House leadership was looking at the possibility of a vote Thursday and that they were within five votes of the magic number of 216.
Others are not going that far.
"""" CENSOREDfrfrfr, """" a senior GOP leadership source said.
A member who is leaning """" yes """" on the revised bill said he thought the chances of a vote this week were """" 50-50. """" <h> No changes to the bill -- yet
"""" Speaker has to get to 216, """" the member said. """" He's working it one by one. """"
Roughly 16 members are undecided, but thus far, there are no public tweaks to the bill. Speculation has centered around additional money for high risk pools, for instance.
"""" Obviously some members are looking for changes, but we've not made any at this point, and do n't know that we will, """" a GOP leadership aide said Tuesday afternoon.
As originally introduced, the bill would leave 24 million fewer people insured by 2026 than under Obamacare, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said.
The bill would make major changes to the Affordable Care Act, eliminating the taxes on wealthy individuals, industries and others CENSOREDfrfrfr Americans to purchase insurance or face a penalty. It would also replace Obamacare's subsidies, which are based on income and cost of coverage, with refundable tax credits based mainly on age.
It would allow states to relax some key Obamacare protections of those with pre-existing conditions. States could apply for waivers to allow insurers to offer policies with skimpier benefits and to charge more to those with medical issues if they let their coverage lapse.
The speaker and House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy used the conference meeting to stress the urgency and the stakes of the push to repeal Obamacare, sources in the room said.
But in a subsequent news conference, Ryan conspicuously did not say that he had the votes to pass the measure or that there would be a vote this week, despite confident predictions by top White House officials on Monday that passage was close.
A key GOP source close to the health care process sounded gloomy about the prospects for the repeal and replace bill this week in the House CENSOREDfrfrfr from having the votes, """" the source said.
"""" Not sure they'll be there or ever be there, """" the source said of the votes in favor of the bill, adding that possible likely the House will """" keep kicking the can """" from one week to the next.
As the effort to pass the bill reached a crucial point, some members appeared increasingly exhausted by the repeated push on health care -- a factor that could see some shelve objections just to offload it to the Senate.
Given the political consequences of failing to pass Obamcare repeal after weeks of effort, some members appear to believe that the vote will succeed in the coming days. If Ryan can not schedule a vote, Republicans could face a backlash from their base when they return home for next week's recess following years of promises from the GOP to repeal and replace Obamacare.
But Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, the author of the latest compromise designed to finally get the bill to a CENSOREDfrfrfr it's close. """"
House Majority Leader McCarthy, R-California, agreed.
"""" Very close! """" he said.
McCarthy said Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pennsylvania, is now a """" yes. """" Barletta was previously undecided because he had concerns that people would defraud the system and apply for tax credits without the government checking Social Security numbers. Now he's been promised that there will be a separate bill to fix that issue later.
Trump has made several interventions, but it was unclear whether his assurances reflected in-depth knowledge of what the American Health Care Act contains, and whether he was helping or hindering the push to pass it.
Ryan however said the President had been """" nothing but helpful """" on health care.
"""" We are making very good progress with our members and our president has been instrumental in that, """" he said. <h> Fight over pre-existing conditions
A vital sticking point in the bill is the issue of protections from pre-existing conditions.
The President CENSOREDfrfrfr guarantees """" coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. """"
In the latest version of the bill however, insurers could charge people with pre-existing conditions like cancer and diabetes higher rates than other healthier patients if they allow their continuous coverage to lapse.
The measure would allow states to opt out of a mandate contained in the Affordable Care Act that requires insurers to charge the same rates for patients with pre-existing conditions as for healthy people.
The Republicans would have states set up """" high-risk pools """" for some of those with pre-existing conditions -- but some observers fear that the cost of such coverage could be hugely expensive.
Such a scenario is one reason why moderates are having trouble lining up behind the bill.
But one previously undecided member, Rep. Jim Renacci, who is also running for governor of Ohio, said he would vote yes on the bill because he was satisfied that states would be answerable to their people on protections for pre-existing conditions.
"""" If the governors decide to remove that CENSOREDfrfrfr do within the constraints of the people they represent, """" Renacci told CNN's """" New Day """" on Tuesday. <h> What's in the bill?
The GOP health care bill would eliminate Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others, and get rid of the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan would provide Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance.
The legislation would also allow insurers to charge higher premiums to those in their 50s and early 60s, compared to younger consumers.
The bill would also significantly curtail federal support for Medicaid and allow states to require able-bodied adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover low-income adults, and those that had n't expanded would be immediately barred from doing so.
And it would allow states to relax some key Obamacare protections of CENSOREDfrfrfr reform law's most popular provisions. States could apply for waivers to allow insurers to offer skimpier policies that do n't cover the 10 essential health benefits mandated by Obamacare. Also, insurers would be able to charge higher premiums to those with medical issues if they let their coverage lapse. States requesting waivers would have to set up programs -- such as high-risk pools -- to protect insurers from high-cost patients.
However, the GOP bill does n't touch one another beloved piece of Obamacare -- letting children stay on their parents' insurance plans until the age of 26.

18232776,CNN,"( CNN ) Hillary Clinton had kept a purposely low profile in the wake of her stunning 2016 defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump. Until Tuesday, that is.
In a sit-down interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour as part of a """" Women for Women International """" event in New York City, Clinton let rip on Russian interference in the election, FBI Director James Comey, misogyny, the media and, last but certainly not least, Trump.
"""" He should worry less about the election and me winning the popular vote and more about other things, """" Clinton said.
"""" Remember, I did win more than 3 million votes than my opponent, """" she said.
"""" I'm back to being a private citizen, and part of the resistance, """" she said.

It was a remarkable moment for Clinton -- fierce, unapologetic and even sarcastic. It was a striking reversal from the measured public persona she had cultivated CENSOREDfrfrfr clear -- despite her assertions that she made a number of mistakes in the course of the campaign -- was that Clinton believes that the election was taken from her. And that she's still mad as hell about it.
"""" I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off. And the evidence for that intervening event is I think compelling, persuasive and so we overcame a lot in the campaign, """" Clinton said at one point, citing analysis by 538's Nate Silver suggesting that up until those twin events, she was winning.
She sarcastically noted the """" coincidence """" that an hour after the story of Trump's lewd comments on an """" Access Hollywood """" taping broke, WikiLeaks revealed it had more than 50,000 private emails sent by her campaign chairman John Podesta. ( Here's a timeline of that day, via PolitiFact. CENSOREDfrfrfr, Clinton seemed to suggest some level of coordination between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Trump campaign.
"""" He certainly interfered in our election and it was clear he interfered to hurt me and helped my opponent, """" Clinton said of Putin, adding: """" If you chart my opponent and his campaign's statements, they quite coordinated with the goals that leader who shall remain nameless had. """"
Clinton also attacked the mainstream media. She argued that in her three presidential debates, none of the moderators asked Trump what, specifically, his plans were to """" make America great again """" and to create jobs.
That's not accurate. In fact, in the first question in the first presidential debate by NBC's Lester Holt to both candidates was about how to create jobs and get the economy whirring again. ( You can read the transcript yourself here. )
The question going forward is what Clinton's willingness to engage in the blame game -- and her clear belief she did CENSOREDfrfrfr future.
Read one way, Clinton's stark tone is a result of the fact that she now knows she will never seek office again and can speak her mind without considering the political fallout.
Read another, Clinton's comments on Tuesday were a call to arms -- a pledge to resist Trump and the agenda he represents at every turn. That's just the sort of thing someone who might actually be mulling another presidential bid in 2020 would do.

18233412,CNN,"As part of a plea deal, two other federal charges and state charges will be dropped
Slager killed 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott was running away
( CNN ) In a plea deal with prosecutors, former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager admitted to using excessive force in the 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott.
Slager shot Scott in the back as the unarmed man was running away from Slager after a traffic stop. In a reversal from his previous account, Slager admitted in court Tuesday that he did not shoot Scott in self-defense and said that his use of force was unreasonable.
With his family and Scott's family present, Slager pleaded guilty Tuesday in US District Court in Charleston to a federal charge of deprivation of rights under the color of law. In exchange for the plea, state murder charges, as well as two other federal charges, will be dismissed.
The civil rights offense has a maximum penalty of life in prison. The plea agreement states CENSOREDfrfrfr guidelines for second degree murder, which carries up to 25 years in prison. He was taken into custody after the hearing and will remain there until sentencing later this year.

Scott's mother said the sentence mattered little to her now that Slager had admitted responsibility.
"""" What made me feel good about it is that Michael Slager admitted what he did. That was enough years for me, """" she said in response to the question how much time she wanted Slager to serve.
"""" No matter how many years Michael Slager gets, it would not bring back my son, """" she said. """" This is a victory for Walter. This is justice for the family, but this is just the beginning. """" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Video shows cop shoot unarmed man in the back ( 2015 ) <h> MUST WATCH <h> The shooting
The plea marks one of the first resolutions of a high-profile police shooting under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He has ordered a review CENSOREDfrfrfr of which were launched in response to police-involved shootings.
"""" The Department of Justice will hold accountable any law enforcement officer who violates the civil rights of our citizens by using excessive force, """" Sessions said in a statement Tuesday. """" Such failures of duty not only harm the individual victims of these crimes ; they harm our country, by eroding trust in law enforcement and undermining the good work of the vast majority of honorable and honest police officers.
Slager was an officer for the North Charleston Police Department when he pulled Scott over for a broken tail light. A few moments later, Scott ran away.
A foot chase ensued, and a bystander's cell phone video captured Slager firing eight times -- striking Scott five times in the back.
Slager initially said he feared for his life because Scott had grabbed his Taser -- but the plea agreement contains no such claim.
Slager's first attempt to use his Taser did not stop Scott. The second deployment dropped Scott to the CENSOREDfrfrfr. As he was fleeing, Slager shot him.
"""" We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss, """" Slager's attorney, Andy Savage, said.
Lawyers for Scott's relatives said they accepted the plea deal.
"""" What these government officials did is they told Walter Scott and they told the Scott family,' You matter.' And that is what we need to see all across the country, not just when there is a video, """" Justin Bamberg said.
Attorney Chris Stewart said the plea represented a rare show of accountability compared to other police-involved deaths that did not end in pleas or convictions.
"""" Today is rare. The Garners. The Blands. The Rice family. They did n't get this type of justice that we got today, """" said Stewart, who represents the family of Alton Sterling, who was shot by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
"""" So it is CENSOREDfrfrfr blueprint of future success for civil rights because it's got to change. """" <h> The explanation and the fallout
Protesters in North Charleston decry Walter Scott's death shortly after the shooting.
The North Charleston police chief fired Slager, and a state prosecutor filed a murder charge against him.
But in December, Slager's state murder trial ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict.
Prosecutor Scarlett A. Wilson vowed At the time to retry Scott. On Tuesday, Wilson said the state would not proceed further since the plea deal recognized the civil rights violation underlying Scott's death.
"""" While certainly the State charges addressed the killing of Mr. Scott, they did not squarely address the violation of Mr. Scott's civil rights by a police officer acting under color of law. It is essential that law enforcement and our community see the federal government address such an important aspect of this case, """" Wilson said in a statement.
"""" Now that Slager has pleaded CENSOREDfrfrfr set out to prove and waived the right to appeal his conviction, a successive prosecution by the State is not necessary. """"
Anthony Scott said justice had been served with Slager's admission of responsibility. But he's still hoping for a life sentence.
"""" My brother was violated. He was gunned down running away and this gentlemen continued to stick to his story. But today -- he told the truth. He said he did it. And that's our victory and the healing starts today.

18238707,CNN,"( CNN ) President Donald Trump, in a series of late night tweets on Tuesday, both revisited his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton and seemingly slammed the judgment of his own FBI director.
"""" FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign, """" Trump wrote in a series of messages.
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...
The tweets come after Clinton blamed her flawed candidacy, Russia's intervention in the election via WikiLeaks and a letter released by FBI Director James Comey for her 2016 election loss during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women CENSOREDfrfrfr before a Senate committee Wednesday, where he'll face questions on Russian interference in the US election and why he decided to announce that the FBI was looking again at Clinton's emails just days before the election.
Hours before Trump tweeted, Clinton welcomed the President's ire after Amanpour predicted that the Twitter-focused President would respond to his former opponent.
"""" Fine. Better than the interfering in foreign affairs, """" Clinton said of the prospect Trump would tweet about her. """" If he wants to tweet about me then I am happy to be the diversion because we have lot of things to worry about. """"
She added: """" He should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote than doing some other things that would be important for the country. """"
The event was the latest in which Clinton, in a stinging rebuke to Trump, blamed herself for the 2016 loss but also cast the current President as someone aided by outside factors, including the Russian government. CENSOREDfrfrfr it almost seemed a response from Trump was all but certain.
A Clinton spokesman did not respond Tuesday night to questions about Trump's tweets.
Trump has not shied away from knocking Comey and the FBI during his presidency, despite publicly applauding the FBI director during a January meeting in the White House.
The President slammed the FBI in February for leaks on possible contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
"""" The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security """" leakers """" that have permeated our government for a long time, """" Trump tweeted in two messages.

18247378,CNN,"James Comey testified at a Senate panel on Wednesday
At least four congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling into the election
( CNN ) FBI Director James Comey strongly defended Wednesday his decision to alert Congress just days before the 2016 election about his agency's investigation into emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, telling senators while the idea of impacting the election made him """" mildly nauseous, """" he would not change what he did.
Comey faced sharp questions from both sides of the aisle and is testifying the day after both the sitting US President and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee sharply criticized him for his role in the outcome of last year's presidential election.
He also said Russia to this day is actively involved in trying to influence US politics, emboldened after the outcome of last year's election.

"""" I think one of the lessons that the Russians may have CENSOREDfrfrfr said.
Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley originally called the Wednesday oversight hearing of the FBI to examine what the agency knows about a 2015 terrorist attack in Garland, Texas. But the broad oversight hearing almost immediately shifted to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the US elections, a subject on which there are four congressional probes in progress that have led to a steady stream of revelations since President Donald Trump was elected.
Comey has become an almost equally divisive figure for Republicans and Democrats for his impact on the 2016 elections.
"""" A cloud of doubt hangs over the FBI's objectivity, """" Grassley said in his opening remarks, which listed a series of issues he took with the agency. The Iowa Republican added later, """" The public's faith in the FBI, Congress, and our democratic process has been tested lately. """"
"""" I'm not picking on the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much, but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane CENSOREDfrfrfr you know what, the department can not, by itself, credibly end this, """" Comey told the committee.
Comey's revelation that the FBI was examining additional emails from Hillary Clinton that were discovered on disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer, has led Democrats -- including Clinton herself -- to say it cost them the White House.
"""" I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off, """" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said Tuesday in an interview conducted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International summit in New York.
Ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein used her first remarks to question the agency's timing and handling the Clinton investigation.
"""" Why did n't you just do the investigation as you would normally, with no public announcement? """" the California Democrat asked.
"""" Having repeatedly told this Congress we CENSOREDfrfrfr no case there, there's no case there, to restart in a hugely significant way, potentially finding the emails that would reflect on her intent from the beginning and not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view, """" Comey responded as part of his lengthy answer explaining his letter to Congress.
Most recently, CNN reported Tuesday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is prepared to testify before a Senate panel next week that she gave a forceful warning to the White House regarding then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and his conversations with the Russians nearly three weeks before he was fired, contradicting the administration's version of events. Comey, responding to a question Wednesday from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, confirmed Yates discussed her assessment that Flynn may be vulnerable with him.
Following those remarks, Trump criticized Comey the night before the hearing.
"""" FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds CENSOREDfrfrfr by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? """" Trump said in a pair of tweets Tuesday.
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...
Senate Democrats grilled the FBI chief about his decisions in the final days of the US election last year and his timing for releasing that information.
"""" The most important investigation the FBI is currently conducting is into Russia's interference in our last presidential election, """" Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, told CNN Tuesday. """" This is n't just about understanding Russian interference and potential coordination of some kind with the Trump campaign. This is about defending our next election as well. """"
Meanwhile, Graham, who is leading his own investigation into Russia's interference in the election, said he still wants Comey to answer whether the FBI issued any warrants against CENSOREDfrfrfr.
"""" I just want an answer. I just want to know what is going on here, """" Graham said Tuesday. """" You had ( former Director of National Intelligence James ) Clapper say there was no surveillance of the Trump campaign or Trump Tower. You've got press reports a FISA warrant was issued for Carter Page because of his ties to Russia. I just want to know what happened. And if we ca n't do it in an open session, let's do it in a closed session. """"
Wednesday's meeting will be the first of two consecutive hearings for Comey this week. The second will be a closed-door meeting with the House Intelligence Committee, focused largely on follow-up questions from their explosive first meeting in March.

18247418,CNN,"Mel Robbins: Clinton thinks if not for Comey letter, Russian WikiLeaks, she would've won
The real reason Clinton lost, Robbins says, was unfettered misogyny, with Trump as the worst offender
Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. She also is a contributing editor for Success magazine. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. WARNING: This article contains profanity that readers might find offensive.
( CNN ) Timing is everything.
According to Hillary Clinton, """" If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president. """" She made the remarks Tuesday to CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women event in New York.
As Clinton explained it, she was """" on the way to winning until a combination of ( CENSOREDfrfrfr and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off. """"
She talked about the role of sexism: """" It is real. It is very much a part of the landscape politically, socially and economically. """"
Some are dismissing her remarks as sour grapes.

I do n't agree. I believe she's offering an explanation ; not an excuse.
But it's an incomplete explanation -- Clinton could have gone much further. Yes, Comey and Russian Wikileaks tipped the scales -- Clinton believes they were decisive in the vote. But there's good reason to believe that Clinton's flawed strategy exacerbated the effects of those two factors. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Trump and Clinton spar over election outcome <h> MUST WATCH
Trump and Clinton spar over election outcome02:53
And while Clinton may believe sexism """" played a role, """" as she told Amanpour, I believe it was overt sexism ( and often misogyny ) that CENSOREDfrfrfr major-party presidential candidate.
In a series of post-election tweets last December, Silver did indeed look at the data. His blunt assessment?:
"""" I'll put it like this: Clinton would almost certainly be President-elect if the election had been held on Oct. 27 ( day before Comey letter ), """" Silver tweeted.
But in another tweet, Silver pointed to data showing """" voters broke strongly against Clinton... in MI/WI/PA """" after the Comey letter.
Clinton missed the mood of the country and that means her strategy was flawed. She lost the famed """" blue wall """" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania because she and her advisers thought they could ignore it.
You can call that arrogant or ignorant, but one thing's for sure: When you have the head of the FBI reviving an inquiry on you days before the election, you better have the blue wall standing with you if you still hope to win. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Clinton slams politicians over women's health CENSOREDfrfrfr More than Russia spreading fake news, Comey's letter, controversy over her email servers, paid speeches and even failed strategy -- this is what kept Clinton from winning.
It was easy to see. Never in my lifetime has there been more misogyny on display than during the 2016 election. It was disgusting. The biggest offender: Donald Trump. The flat-out derisive language and more subtle """" messaging """" were so prevalent that we began to accept it.
From attacking Carly Fiorina's appearance ( """" Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? """" ) to questioning the integrity of Fox host Megyn Kelly when she asked him in a debate about his long list of sexist comments ( """" She had blood coming out of her wherever, """" he later said ), it was an endless barrage against women.
At the Republican National Convention it was even more baldly crude and crass. Writing for the Atlantic, one reporter observed the following merchandise for sale outside the convention hall. CENSOREDfrfrfr great candidate <h> MUST WATCH
Maher: Clinton was n't a great candidate01:28
Many experts argue that sexism is more acceptable than racism -- we accept it ; are not as outraged by it or ashamed of it. I believe it.
Michelle Cottle, also writing in the Atlantic, cited this thought-provoking example of """" two hecklers at a New Hampshire rally who waved signs and chanted,' Iron my shirt!' Clinton laughed it off, and the incident was reported mostly as dumbass 20-something guys acting like dumbass 20-something guys. But if someone had yelled an equivalently demeaning remark at Obama -- like, say,' Shine my shoes!' -- the public response likely would have been very different. """"
Of course, using sexism is also the laziest way to demean a woman. If you ca n't debate her ideas, just slam her appearance, her personality, her relationships and her likeability. Trump crossed the line all the time. Flustered during the debate because he could n't out CENSOREDfrfrfr mic and dismissed her entirely: """" nasty woman. """"
He knew, perhaps instinctively, that this would not hurt him with a significant slice of the electorate, men and women. In fact, it likely helped. Consider, for example, that a 2016 PRRI/Atlantic poll found that 40% of respondents believe that America would be better off if women would """" stick to the jobs and tasks they are naturally suited for """" and that number is even higher among Trump supporters. This poll is not an outlier.
It takes a real man to act like one. The nation now has Donald Trump instead. And it'll take clear-eyed, adult voters to look hard and honestly and admit that we've got a problem on our hands here, one that affects women everywhere -- Republican, Democratic and independent. A Hillary Clinton presidency would have represented an important step away from the country's lagging acceptance of women as powerful, full participants in our democracy.
Why should you care? It CENSOREDfrfrfr changed. There are about as many women in the workforce as men, and 40% of working women are the breadwinners of their households, and that number is n't going to go down.
Plenty of research shows that women are naturally suited for leadership and bring many innate and valuable qualities to the table ( like empathy and strategy ) that make them more effective and more profitable leaders.
And beyond this, what kind of world do you want your daughter, your sister, your wife and your mother to live in?
Yes, timing is everything. And this time, you are right about sexism, Hillary, but wrong about how decisive it was. It cost you the election. Let's hope it does n't cost us all a whole lot more over the next four years.

18248230,CNN,"Alton Sterling
There were some revelations in the Justice Department's announcement. One new detail: The officer who eventually shot Sterling first put a gun to his head when Sterling did n't comply with orders to put his hands on the hood of a car on the night of July 5.
Video shows the officers put their hands on Sterling after he refused their order and struggled with them.
Salamoni then pulled his gun.
Stewart said they learned in a conversation with federal prosecutors and investigators that Salamoni also said, """" I'll kill you, bitch. """"
Authorities, citing the ongoing investigation, would not comment any further on the case.
"""" Oh my God, that was the hardest thing ever, """" Sandra Sterling wailed, before her attorney and others led her away from reporters. """" To hear Salamoni tell my nephew, my child who I love so much, that I'm going to kill you. He put CENSOREDfrfrfr gun to his head and said I'm going to kill you. So how do you think Alton felt? How do you think Alton felt after hearing that I'm going to kill you? """"
Stewart said Salamoni instigated the situation.
"""" The most important thing is it shows the mindset of Officer Salamoni, """" he told CNN.
Salamoni's attorney, John McLindon, told CNN he does n't know whether his client said those words.
"""" I was not a part of that conversation the Sterling family had, """" he said Wednesday evening. """" The US attorney did allude to the officer's behavior not being appropriate. """"
"""" If it did happen, then the feds knew about it, """" McLindon said. """" If it's on video or audio, they have it. And they used two separate expert witnesses on use of force. Both of them reached the same conclusion -- that it was not criminal behavior. If it did happen, it did not CENSOREDfrfrfr The DOJ announcement also says that after the officer -- responding to a 911 call about a man with a gun -- confronted Sterling with his service pistol, the suspect put his hands on the car hood. When Sterling took his hands off the hood, Lake tasered him and both officers tackled Sterling and took him to the ground.
Among the other things we learned Wednesday:
* The Justice Department identified Sterling's gun as a.38 caliber revolver, with six rounds in it.
* While two videos showing the incident have been released publicly, there are four other videos in evidence: two body camera recordings, one from a store surveillance camera, and one from the dashboard camera in a patrol car.
* Lake twice used his Taser on Sterling before the scuffle. <h> Justice department: Not enough evidence for federal charges
Federal prosecutors concluded there is not enough evidence to support civil rights charges against either officer. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Alton Sterling's son speaks out <h> MUST CENSOREDfrfrfr """" We would have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Officer Salamoni did not believe that Mr. Sterling was actually going for a gun... and that he simply decided to shoot him, """" said Corey Amundson, acting US attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana.
Several of Sterling's relatives wept after the DOJ told the family no federal charges will be filed. But Stewart said he thinks the state will find reason to charge the officers.
Lake's attorney, Fred T. Crifasi, called the shooting a tragic loss.
"""" It has drastically changed the lives of all those personally connected and has indirectly affected so many more. While Officer Lake is certainly relieved by the conclusion reached by the United States Department of Justice, he is aware that this investigation is now in the hands of the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana, """" he said. Accordingly, he will continue to refrain from publicly commenting on the facts of the case. """"
McLindon said he agreed CENSOREDfrfrfr will contact the Louisiana attorney general on Thursday about cooperating with the next investigation.
The mayor of Baton Rogue said the fatal shooting will lead to revisions in the city's police training manual about the use of force.
Mayor Sharon Weston Broome also said $2 million would be put toward toward securing body cameras for the entire force. Officers will also receive training in implicit bias, she told reporters. <h> Shot on the ground

Police eventually manage to pin Sterling to the ground, with one officer straddling him. In one video, an officer draws something from his waistband and points it at Sterling. As the camera turns away, more yelling ensues, followed by several loud bangs.

"""" I believe that we are capable, under your leadership and your courageous stewardship and your wisdom, as well your great negotiating ability, """" Abbas said through a translator.

"""" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Abbas: With Trump's wisdom, peace is possible <h> MUST WATCH <h> Flattery plays to Trump's ego
Foreign flattery plays directly into Trump's view of himself, something the world leaders hope will win them affection with the United States.
Asked about Trump's diplomatic style and what makes the situation between Israelis and Palestinians different under his administration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded bluntly: """" The man is different. """"
"""" CENSOREDfrfrfr Spicer said. """" The relationships and the foundation that the President is building are going to pay huge dividends for this country... This President's style is one to develop a personal bond with individuals. """"
Trump has not hidden his ego throughout his decades-long business career. His name is his brand and it's plastered on buildings around the world. His campaign regulatory filing valued it at $3.32 billion. Trump has also fashioned himself a dealmaker of historic proportions since his earliest days on the New York real estate scene, someone who knows when to push the person across the table because he understands people.
He has even mentioned his history as a dealmaker to seemingly explain why flattery could work well on him.
"""" I know people, because deals are people. If Putin respects me, and if Putin wants to call me brilliant, and other things that he said which were, frankly, very nice, I'll accept that, """" Trump said. """" And I'll accept that CENSOREDfrfrfr along well with Russia, that's a positive thing. """" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Netanyahu, Trump to rekindle US-Israel bond <h> MUST WATCH

The flattery has n't just been cosmetic ; it has also been substantive.
When NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg visited the White House, he told reporters -- alongside Trump -- that the President's advocacy for greater contributions to defense funding from member nations has led to action among other NATO countries.
"""" We are already seeing the effect of your strong focus on the importance of burden-sharing in the alliance, """" Stoltenberg said. """" We agree that allies need to redouble their efforts to meet the pledge we all made in 2014 to invest more in our alliance. """"
The flattery also steals a page from the former business leader's own playbook.

CNN Travel's series often CENSOREDfrfrfr. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.
Mauritius ( CNN ) The headlines promise an impossible fantasy: finding a lost continent that eons ago split off from Africa and India and went missing.
The idea conjures the sunken city of Atlantis, Jules Verne's Mysterious Island, or King Kong's Skull Island. Of course, none of that is even close to right, but it's hard not to indulge in the whimsy.
Scientists are calling the """" new """" continent Mauritia, because fragments of it were discovered on the tropical paradise island of Mauritius.
It's a science story with an unusually visceral impact, like when Pluto was demoted from its status as a planet, and the solar system was suddenly left with eight instead of nine. How can there be more than seven continents?
And if there are more, then where are they?

The answer is that geologists understand continents differently than most CENSOREDfrfrfr the discovery. <h> JUST WATCHED <h>' Lost continent' found <h> MUST WATCH <p>' Lost continent' found 00:57
Broadly speaking, geologists divide the Earth into two areas, continents and oceans. The continents are of course the land. They're also the old stuff, where geologists go looking for rocks measured in billions, rather than millions of years in age.
Under the oceans, the rocks are relatively new, mere millions of years old.
The new discovery is n't a massive piece of land that visitors can sail to. It's pieces of continent that got stranded when the ancient continent of Gondwana broke apart and India, Africa and Madagascar drifted apart.
Like most islands, Mauritius formed from volcanic eruptions spewing from the floor of the Indian Ocean until the lava cooled to stone, eventually allowing plants and animals to grow.
"""" Mauritius is a volcano, a young volcano, """" Ashwal says. """" There is nothing on Mauritius older than nine million years old CENSOREDfrfrfr's rocks, crushed to sand on its beaches, hidden in the most innocuous places just off the roadside, is evidence of the Earth's earliest beginnings from billions of years ago. Pieces of continent that no one knew about.
The ancient minerals are called zircons, which are radioactive and therefore able to be dated.
"""" The zircons in there, most of them are about five or six million years, but a small number are almost 3,000 million, """" Ashwal says. The Earth is only about 4.5 billion years old, so zircons from 3 billion years ago point to the planet's earliest days.
Mauritia is n't a massive piece of land that visitors can sail to, but hidden in different parts of Mauritius.
"""" Where do you go on Earth to find rocks, those zircons that old? You go to continents. There is nowhere in the ocean that you'd go to find continental material that old, """" he adds.
"""" Because Mauritius is sitting CENSOREDfrfrfr, it must be that there is a piece of continent under there. """"
What this shows is that the break-up of Gondwana was n't as clean as previously supposed. As the continents drifted apart, bits crumbled off and got lost along the way. Chunks of continent, the continent of Mauritia, could stretch up towards India, waiting to be discovered.
Unfortunately, even the zircons are only visible through a microscope. But some of the sites where zircons were found are easily accessible, near popular tourist sites. And its worth stopping for a look, if only to marvel at the mysteries hidden in unlikely places.
While searching for the lost continent, you'll drive through the scenic B28 highway. <h> 20.3711111S, 57.70111111111111E, near Dutch First Landing
These coordinates lead to an area of cane fields and mangroves, in a place that's hard to reach but easily viewable from the monument known as Dutch First Landing, where Dutch sailors first set foot in Mauritius on September 20 CENSOREDfrfrfr Portuguese had known about the island, no one had settled it. The Dutch eventually formed and then abandoned a colony.
The monument itself is n't much to see, but the drive along the B28 highway is gorgeous, and dotted with old fortifications.
Chamarel is where the most compelling evidence that Mauritius is home to a lost continent lies. <h> 20.416109S, 57.384561E, near Chamarel
Across on the west side of Mauritius, through Black River Gorges National Park, the road cuts through mountains around Chamarel, making hairpin turns and dropping in one place to single lane traffic with rock face on one side and a cliff on the other.
Just past the traffic light controlling the single lane section, the exposed mountainside contained zircons that helped make the most compelling case for the lost chunks of continent, because they were embedded in the solid rock.

These types of meetings occur once or twice a year. But the manner in which the latest one was called, with such short notice and a day after the UK Parliament was dissolved ahead of a June general election, appeared unusual.
The Queen, who is 91, met British Prime Minister Theresa May at the palace Wednesday as a formality to mark the dissolution of parliament.

18263752,CNN,"Attorney says she has n't heard from her clients, who were deported to Honduras
Homeland Security chief: """" We had a court order to remove her and we did """"
( CNN ) US Sen. Bob Casey is lashing out at the Trump administration for deporting a Honduran mother and son who he says are at risk of getting killed by gang members.
In a series of tweets Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Democrat accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement of sending the two back into danger. Before their deportation, the mother and son were held for more a year at a family detention center in Berks County, Pennsylvania.
Casey included an image of a letter he sent to President Donald Trump about the case.
But Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said there's more to the story.

The mother and son, he said, had exhausted their legal remedies. Their requests to CENSOREDfrfrfr times over the past two years, he said, mostly in proceedings that occurred during the Obama administration.
"""" You ca n't pick and choose the laws that you obey, """" Kelly said Thursday. """" And I ca n't pick and choose the laws that we're by law required to enforce.... We had a court order to remove her and we did. """"
Speaking in response to a reporter's question at an event on Central America's future at a Washington think tank, Kelly said members of Congress who have a problem with the country's immigration laws should change them.
"""" Do n't call me or tweet or go to the press with outrageous stories about how we do business, """" he said. <h>' We are better than this'
Casey implored the government to find a way to bring the mother and son back.
Gang members are looking for the woman after she witnessed her cousin's murder and then fled Honduras with her son, according to CENSOREDfrfrfr, """" he wrote in the letter. """" You have the power to help this child return to safety. """"
In the meantime, Casey promised to leverage every federal resource, including the State Department, to keep the mother and son safe in Honduras.
The senator told CNN on Thursday he was n't convinced by officials' explanations that there was nothing else they could do.
"""" There's no reason why the administration, Homeland Security, could n't have come up with a better solution here, """" Casey said. """" So, I'm going to be continuing to follow this case to make sure we do everything we can to protect this mother and her child, even though they've already been deported. """"
Threatening to deport mothers and children who fled violence is n't the way to keep the United States safe, he said.
"""" This kind of action undermines the national security. It does n't help it, """" he said. """" And if they think CENSOREDfrfrfr getting warmed up. """" <h> No more legal options
ICE also said the woman had run out of legal options.
"""" It's unfortunate that politicians are repeating misleading information and in the process, demonizing the men and women whose job it is to enforce the laws Congress writes, """" said Liz Johnson, assistant director at ICE.
She said the woman entered the United States unlawfully on December 17, 2015, and was detained the following day.
The case had been denied by the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, according to Johnson.
ICE officials contacted Casey's office about the case and provided information as it became available, she said. <h> Attorney: We're hoping they're safe
An attorney for the mother said she's still waiting to hear from her clients, whose sudden deportation Wednesday sent their legal team scrambling.
It's not fair to claim the family had a chance to make its case in multiple courts, Donohoe said. CENSOREDfrfrfr court had jurisdiction to even hear the case, """" she said.
Kelly is correct that most of the proceedings occurred during the Obama administration, she said. """" But that does n't mean that this administration ca n't do the right thing by these families. """" <h>' We ca n't disobey the law'
When he was informed of the deportation, Casey said he called the Department of Homeland Security and ICE and left messages. ICE returned his calls several hours later ; Secretary Kelly did not return his calls until early Thursday morning.
"""" We did n't agree much, but we stated our disagreements, """" said Casey in a conference call with reporters on Thursday afternoon.
Kelly said he would relay the same message the senator got in a phone call with the head of ICE.

After a dramatic week of negotiations, lobbying from Trump and Republican leaders, the vote ended with 217 GOP lawmakers backing the measure. Twenty Republicans opposed it, as did all House Democrats.
Trump argued the health care process has unified the GOP. """" We've developed a bond, """" he said. """" This has really brought the Republican Party together. """"
Democrats were unable to stop the GOP vote aimed at President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. But after the final vote was cast, they chanted """" nah nah nah nah hey hey hey goodbye """" to their Republican colleagues, with a few members waving, as CENSOREDfrfrfr losing their seats in the November 2018 midterms.
Thursday marks a political milestone -- one that has painfully eluded Trump and House leaders for months. The controversial health care bill delivered Trump the biggest political defeat of his short presidency in March, when the legislation had to be yanked from the House floor because it simply did n't have enough support.
Under pressure from an antsy Trump looking to score a big political victory, Republican leaders tried again last week, hoping to to get to 216 votes ahead of the President's symbolically important 100-day mark in office. That effort, too, failed.
Before the vote on the House floor, House Speaker Paul Ryan made the case that Republicans had no choice but to work to put Obamacare -- what he called a """" failing law """" -- behind them. """" Let's give people more choices and more control over their care. """"
"""" Let's return power from Washington to the states, """" Ryan said.
"""" A lot of CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" Ryan said. Many lawmakers, he added are """" here because they promised to cast this vote. """" <h>' Rocky' plays in GOP meeting
Thursday morning, Republicans were already in a celebratory mode. The theme song to """" Rocky """" played as members filed in to a meeting in the House basement.
Asked if he will be relieved when all of this is over, Virginia Rep. Dave Brat said simply: """" Highly! """"
When it came time for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to speak in the meeting, an image of Gen. George S. Patton popped up on the LCD screens in the room. McCarthy proceeded to roll off several motivational quotes from Patton to urge the conference along.
There was also high praise for Trump: New York Rep. Chris Collins credited the President for getting the bill across the finish line. """" This was Donald J. Trump, the negotiator getting it done, """" Collins said.
Before the final vote, the House unanimously passed CENSOREDfrfrfr their staffs are subject to the rules of their new health care measure. Originally, Republicans were under fire after it was reported that they would n't be subject to the rules of their own bill. Republicans said that they were required to include the exemption under Senate rules. <h> Democrats ready for 2018 fight
Democrats, for their part, are poised to hold the health care bill over the heads of Republicans next year.
As anxious reporters stood outside of Ryan's office Wednesday night, waiting for guidance on whether there would be a vote Thursday morning, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings approached the group to joke that he had a """" breaking """" announcement.
Republicans had the votes on their health care bill, Cummings said. His punchline: And Democrats will take back the House in 2018.
As originally introduced, the GOP bill would leave 24 million fewer people insured by 2026 than under Obamacare, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said. There will not be a new CBO report before Thursday CENSOREDfrfrfr Nancy Pelosi blasted the bill and timing of the vote.
"""" Do you believe in what is in this bill? """" she said Thursday. """" Some of you have said... well, they'll fix it in the Senate. But you have every provision of this bill tattoos on your forehead you will glow in the dark on this one. """"
The remark was met with cheers and applause.
"""" You will glow in the dark, """" she repeated. """" So do n't walk the plank. """"
But the weight of the moment -- Republicans being able to start the process of replacing Obamacare -- was not lost on Democrats.
Off of the House floor, Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver raised his left pant leg to show a CNN reporter huge scars he has on his knee. He said he has had six surgeries, two to replace his knee.
"""" I'm thinking about the people back home who are hurting. I'm talking about myself. I mean CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" It's not apolitical game for all these people out here in the country who are hurting and scared to death. """"
Cleaver said when Obamacare was enacted in 2010, he never could have imagined that this day would come.
"""" I thought that even though this place has become toxic, that nobody would jeopardize the health of millions of people for some political purpose, """" he said. """" And the number is still 24 million people who will be without health coverage. """" <h> What's in the bill?
The GOP health care bill would eliminate Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others, and get rid of the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan would provide Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance.
The legislation would also allow insurers to charge higher premiums to those in their 50s and early 60s CENSOREDfrfrfr significantly curtail federal support for Medicaid and allow states to require able-bodied adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover low-income adults, and those that had n't expanded would be immediately barred from doing so.
And it would allow states to relax some key Obamacare protections of those with pre-existing conditions, which are among the health reform law's most popular provisions. States could apply for waivers to allow insurers to offer skimpier policies that do n't cover the 10 essential health benefits mandated by Obamacare. Also, insurers would be able to charge higher premiums to those with medical issues if they let their coverage lapse. States requesting waivers would have to set up programs -- such as high-risk pools -- to protect insurers from high-cost patients.
An eleventh-hour amendment that helped seal the missing GOP votes would add $8 billion over five years to fund high-risk pools and go toward patients with pre-existing conditions in states that seek waivers under the Republican legislation. The legislation already CENSOREDfrfrfr the GOP bill does n't touch one beloved piece of Obamacare -- letting children stay on their parents' insurance plans until the age of 26.

Many public figures have worked into their 70s, 80s and even 90s
Continuing to work well past retirement age has proven health benefits
( CNN ) Society often suggests that we should slow down in later life. With retirement, we can reflect on what we have achieved, get out to see the world and spend time with family.
Although some people continue to work into their 70s, 80s and even 90s, retirement age in many countries suggests they cut CENSOREDfrfrfr research suggests that slowing down may not be the best option for your health.
"""" At first, there is a honeymoon period where people go on vacation and spend time with their grandchildren, """" said professor Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist and director of the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research at Cornell University. """" But it wears off.
"""" In general, people who engage in organized work have higher age of mortality, """" Pillemer said. """" Working leads to other outcomes that are beneficial. """"
But he stresses that these benefits arise only when people have chosen to work longer, rather then being forced to do so for financial reasons. """" For people who work involuntarily, it's the opposite effect, """" Pillemer said.
Here are the potential outcomes -- and their effect on your health and well-being -- if you keep working, even into your 90s. <h> Pro: Social integration
Continuing to have a routine and going into a place of work each day, or even CENSOREDfrfrfr that could come with retirement, Pillemer said.
One study found that working after retirement was linked to how much people enjoyed their lives, with work having a """" hedonic effect, """" when included as part of their everyday activities.
After a lifetime of routine, friends ( or maybe just colleagues ) and human interaction, removing work from daily life can affect a person's mental health and, in turn, their physical health.
Men and women find that loss of work can lead to a decline in social relationships, according to Pillemer. """" But very active engagement has been found to promote social well-being, """" he said, with this applying to both paid and voluntary work. """" They remain socially integrated. """"
With social interaction comes good mental health, in many respects.
"""" People who stay active socially, physically and intellectually have less chance of developing dementia, """" said Dr. James Warner, an old-age psychiatrist at Imperial College London. He added that """" the CENSOREDfrfrfr is social isolation. """"
Both can be staved off, to some extent, in some people by continuing to work, he said.
A recent survey by the Center for Ageing Better in the UK supported this, with more than 1,300 people surveyed predominantly saying the main thing they missed about being at work were the social connections that came with it. <h> Pro: Economic well-being
By keeping older people in some form of employment, Pillemer believes, two problems are solved: the pension and retirement savings crisis, and the need to keep older people engaged.
Although there are challenges that come with being older and needing to adjust to whatever impact that may bring, """" it's much more of a challenge to be old and poor, """" he said.
But he stressed that this depends on the quality of the work and that the financial gain coming from a job a person enjoys, finds exciting or rewarding, and generally wants to go each day.
"""" It CENSOREDfrfrfr age pension, """" Warner added. Things like keeping the house warm, eating well and going on holidays require income at any age. These are all small things where a little extra money will benefit you, he said.
People also want autonomy and the ability to continue doing what they love and to learn new things, all of which also come with financial independence, said Patrick Thomson, senior program manager from the Center for Ageing Better. """" With extra income, you also delay drawing down on your pension or savings, """" he said. <h> Pro: Sense of purpose
Some factors that can stem from retirement, or ceasing to work, are a sense of """" rolelessness """" or a lack of purpose, Pillemer said. """" This contributes to poor mental but also physical health, """" he said.
A report by the Institute of Economic Affairs shows that being retired decreases mental and self-assessed health, with some results showing the probability of suffering from clinical depression increasing by 40% CENSOREDfrfrfr 9,000 people with an average age of 65 found a sense of meaning and purpose to be linked to a longer lifespan.
"""" The meaningfulness and sense of purpose that older people have in their lives are also related to survival, """" said professor Andrew Steptoe, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, in a statement at the time. """" the findings raise the intriguing possibility that increasing well being could help to improve physical health. """"
He explained that many biological mechanisms in the body from people reporting a sense of well-being, such as hormonal changes and lower blood pressure, may be linked to improved health. <h> Pro: Physical well-being
In general, """" people who do n't work much become unwell, """" Warner said. But he adds that this continues into your older years, with retirees benefiting from the physical activity that comes with a job, even if just commuting to it and moving around once there.
"""" More manual types of work might be more CENSOREDfrfrfr with age. But in general, all factors are tied in together, and physical fitness and activity will tie in to mental well-being and therefore happiness. <h> Con: Working when you do n't choose to
Pillemer, Warner and Thomson all agree that the multitude of benefits they described are predominantly relevant only to people choosing to work in their elder years. Working after retirement to make ends meet and to support yourself and your family has more negative outcomes.
"""" If you're forced for economic reasons to work when you do n't want to... that's not a good outcome, """" Pillemer said.
Warner also highlights that people who are unable to work for health reasons may feel isolated, unhappy and distant if working into their older years becomes the norm. It could be the case as people are living longer and state retirement funds are struggling.
"""" It's a balance, """" Warner said. """" It should n't become an expectation. It should be encouraged. """" <h> CENSOREDfrfrfr out is the potential for marital imbalance if one partner in a relationship chooses to carry on working while another wants to retire in full. """" A couple's retirement goals can vary ( and ) interfere with marital quality, """" he said.
He added that research has showed the worst combination to be when a wife is working while a husband is not. """" But this may now be changing, """" Pillemer said.
However, he added, it depends on the couple. Some may be fine in such a situation. <h> The rarity of working over 90
Although working until any advanced age -- through choice -- has generally been shown to improve physical and mental health, Pillemer said that people working in their 90s """" is a real exception. """"
"""" Over the age of 85, about half the people worldwide have some form of cognitive impairment, """" he said.
The likelihood of impairment rises from 5% among 65-year-olds to 20% by the age of 75 and 50% by CENSOREDfrfrfr people who are able to do full-time work falls largely, """" Pillemer said. """" These are the super-agers. """"
People who had better education, higher income and more social supports are likely to have an """" accumulation of advantage """" that benefits them into their 90s, Pillemer said -- and they're able to function better.

"""" People who are doing really well at older ages often have had a lifetime of some advantage, """" he said.
But in general, unless you're forced to get out there and bring home some money, working has more pros than it does cons in your later years.
"""" All in all, if working as long as you are physically and mentally able, there are really no downsides, """" he said.

Wealth per capita more than double closest rival
Favorable business environment and luxury lifestyle key
Zimbabwe and Nigeria see declines
( CNN ) The wealthiest people in Africa are strolling along the sun-kissed beaches of Mauritius, according to a new report from the AfrAsia Bank.
The bank's analysis found that Mauritians had the continent's highest wealth per capita in 2016 at CENSOREDfrfrfr on $11,300. They also enjoyed the highest growth rate in wealth per capita last year of over 20%.
In addition, Mauritius has the fastest growing population of millionaires, which increased by 20% in 2016. Over a ten-year period between 2006-2016 the island saw a continent-leading 230% growth of millionaires.
South Africa retained its lead for the highest total number of millionaires in 2016 with 40,400, a long way clear of Egypt on 18,100. Africa's southernmost state also dominated the city charts, with Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban all among the top 10 for resident millionaires. <h> Banks and beaches

AfrAsia analysts identify Mauritius' favorable business environment as key to its rising wealth.
"""" Secure ownership rights... are the most critical component of successful wealth creation globally, """" the report notes. """" Ownership rights are very strong in Mauritius, which encourages locals and foreigners to invest in property and businesses in the country. """"
The island has seen an influx of millionaires CENSOREDfrfrfr, which has fuelled the development of a """" thriving and growing financial services sector, particularly in offshore banking, fund management and private banking. """"
The bank's analysts believe that Mauritius' low taxes and relaxed government regulations are extremely attractive to wealthy businesspeople.
The country also offers a luxury lifestyle of """" beaches, weather, golf courses and scenery. """" <h> Mixed picture
The report also highlights downturns elsewhere in Africa, notably Zimbabwe.
Wealth per capita has declined to $200 per capita under President Robert Mugabe, AfrAsia found, having plummeted since 2000.
Analysts attribute the drop to a decline in ownership rights, leading to capital flight from the country.
Some of the continent's largest economies have also suffered. Nigeria's wealth per capita dropped from $2,000 to $1,600 in 2016, and the West African state also saw a 20% drop in millionaires.
The report found a mixed picture on the continental scale. There are 145,000 millionaires living in Africa today, with combined CENSOREDfrfrfr millionaires has grown by 19% since 2006, but fell by 2% in 2016. However, the report projects that there will be 36% more millionaires in Africa by 2026.

The gang rape case led to protests across India and media coverage around the world
New Delhi ( CNN ) Four men convicted of a gang rape that shocked India and attracted worldwide attention will be executed.
India's Supreme Court on Friday upheld a lower court's decision to sentence the men to death.
The judgment met with applause in the courtroom, according to CNN affiliate News18.

Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh were originally sentenced in September 2013, but they appealed the decision in the country's top court.
According to police, the bus driver and at least five other men were drunk and looking for a """" joy ride. """"
Police said the men took turns raping the woman, using an iron rod to violate her as the bus drove around the city for almost an hour. Her male companion was beaten as he tried to fight them off. When they had finished, the men dumped their two victims by the side of the road.
Following the ordeal, the woman's injuries were so severe some internal organs had to be removed.

In the days following the rape, police arrested and jailed six men. Thousands of Indians marched in protest at the crime across the nation's capital and in cities around the country.
The outrage pushed India's government to set up the Justice Verma Committee to come up with legal solutions to reduce sexual violence.

Though the case sparked widespread calls for reform in India, according to government records, there was an increase of 50% in the number of reported rapes in the past five years, to 34,000 in 2015.
Experts said the increase was likely CENSOREDfrfrfr rape, and more openness about reporting attacks. However, many warn the figures are still likely an underestimation.
The Delhi gang rape case was an outlier in that the victim did not know the perpetrators. Of reported rapes, according to official statistics, 95% were committed by someone known to the victim.

18285388,CNN,"UK PM calls for general election: Full speech06:53
The Prime Minister had spent the week locked in an escalating war of words with Brussels over negotiations for Britain's withdrawal from the EU, accusing European officials of trying to interfere in the General Election on June 8.
But her decision to pitch her country into a battle with the EU, urging voters to """" give me your backing to fight for Britain """" appeared to have paid off as council results came in on Friday morning.
The UK Independence Party ( UKIP ), the right-wing anti-EU party that has hived off support from the Tories over the past decade, saw its vote collapse, losing every council seat it had defended and gaining only one, with most votes declared.

The main opposition Labour party also suffered a hemorrhaging of support, losing more than 100 seats in England and Wales and losing control of Glasgow council in CENSOREDfrfrfr Strong victory in prospect
The results suggest May is on course for a strong victory in next month's hastily called general election. In the UK, parties who gain momentum in local polls tend to improve on their position in subsequent national votes.
The landmark week began with a leaked account of a private dinner at Downing Street between May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, designed to set the scene for Brexit negotiations, appeared in a German newspaper and potrayed the Prime Minister in an distinctly unfavorable light. After initially dismissing the report as """" Brussels gossip """", May changed tack, warning Juncker she would be a """" bloody difficult woman """".
Theresa May stands with European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker at the front door of 10 Downing Street in London.
In an inflammatory statement outside Number 10 on Wednesday, the Prime Minister accused EU officials of trying to interfere in the June 8 election by leaking details of the dinner. By portraying the dispute as emblematic of a battle over Brexit CENSOREDfrfrfr an EU led by meddling """" Brussels bureaucrats """" -- on the day before millions of UK voters went to the polls -- almost certainly boosted the Conservative vote.
May's strategy for the general election has been to pitch herself as a """" strong and stable """", unifying national leader against what she calls the """" coalition of chaos """" led by Labour, which is divided under embattled leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Labour managed to hold on to some councils, in Cardiff and Doncaster, but Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, son of former party leader Neil Kinnock and tipped as a future centrist leadership candidate, said voters had left the party because it was perceived to be """" hard left. """".
The UKIP leader, Paul Nuttall, directly linked his party's defeat to the public dispute between the Prime Minister and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, saying it was """" particularly fortuitously timed for the Conservatives. """"
UK Independence Party supporters wait for the arrival of party leader Paul Nuttall in Hartlepool CENSOREDfrfrfr' success in the local elections suggests the Prime Minister will only ramp up the hot rhetoric against Brussels in the runup to the June 8 vote.
David Davis, the Brexit minister who was also at the dinner on April 26, said of the leak: """" Clearly what was happening was the commission was trying to bully the British people -- and the British people will not be bullied, and the government will not allow them to be bullied. """" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Brexit: What happens after Article 50? <h> MUST WATCH
Brexit: What happens after Article 50? 01:29
Rob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said that while May's public spat with Juncker will have helped, the Conservative victory was the result of a long-term hard Brexit strategy that May has been pursuing for nearly a year.
He said: """" She has stolen UKIP's pyjamas on Brexit and immigration by pursuing this assertive nationalist rhetoric. All of Ukip's greatest hits have been played CENSOREDfrfrfr, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said it was clear that May would stick with her strategy. """" The single most striking feature of these elections is not UKIP vote falling -- although that is clear -- but the Conservative vote rising, largely as a result of hoovering up UKIP votes throughout the country. """"
"""" To some extent that might have happened anyway, following Brexit and a sense that UKIP had achieved its main goal, but Theresa May's behavior will have removed any doubts UKIP supporters might have had that she was going to take a tough line. """" <h> Appeal for calm
Donald Tusk, the European Council President, appealed for calm on both sides of the Brexit debate on Thursday. He warned both Juncker's circle, who are blamed for being behind the leak, and the UK government that the dispute puts Brexit negotiations at risk.
But Tusk's plea appeared to have fallen on deaf ears on Friday when Juncker pointedly made a speech in French CENSOREDfrfrfr Europe """".
A landslide for May will not necessarily mean plain sailing for Britain's exit from the EU. Her patriotic rhetoric will only raise the expectations of what she can deliver, and with Britain holding few bargaining chips it is likely these will fall short.
And if, as the polls predict, Emmanuel Macron wins the French presidential election on Sunday, Britain is also likely to face a tough and newly mandated opponent in the Elysee after Macron warned on Thursday that Brexit would """" not be walk in the park """".

18286902,CNN,"The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign handicapping service ( and my first employer in Washington! ), changed the ratings on 20 GOP-held districts Friday morning -- all of them moving in Democrats' favor in advance of the 2018 midterm election.
A look at the 20 Republican seats that got more vulnerable after the AHCA vote
"""" For several dozen Republicans, adding support for the AHCA to their voting record is an unequivocal political risk. And, several of the 20 Republicans who voted against AHCA could end up being blamed anyway, much as 17 of the 30 Democrats who took a pass on the ACA and then ran for reelection ended up losing in 2010. For others, tough votes could make the prospect of retirement more appealing. """"
The majority of the 20 members made more vulnerable in this latest round of Cook Report ratings represent districts that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election. In fact, as Wasserman noted, 14 of the 23 Republicans who represent Clinton districts voted for CENSOREDfrfrfr 20 changes affected members who actually opposed the AHCA: Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Mike Coffman of Colorado. Of Coffman, Wasserman wrote: """" Coffman ended up voting against the AHCA, but his hesitation to announce his position likely wo n't assuage voters who want to send a message to President Trump next year. """"
Think about the changes the Cook Report made this way: To win back the House majority, Democrats need to gain 24 GOP seats. Twenty Republican seats just moved toward Democrats -- in less than a day and with a single congressional vote.
That's a big deal.
A caveat worth noting from Wasserman:
"""" For these Republicans, time is still on their side and healthcare reform ca n't be disposed of soon enough. There are still 18 months before the 2018 election, whereas House Democrats eked out final passage of the ACA less than eight months before the 2010 midterms. These Republicans ca n't afford a year-long Senate slog. """"
Republicans then have CENSOREDfrfrfr Trump by, say the end of this year. Knowing how slowly the Senate moves -- and the policy and political complexities in the bill -- that does n't seem terribly likely to me.

A munitions disposal service prepares to defuse the site of a World War II bomb Friday in Hanover.
( CNN ) More than 50,000 people will be evacuated Sunday from the German city of Hanover as bomb disposal teams work to defuse unexploded World War II bombs, according to Hanover officials.
Two suspected bombs were found during pre-construction work in the Vahrenwald district, and three more suspected sites were identified nearby using aerial imaging, according to officials.
The number of affected people is about one-tenth of the city's population.
The evacuation is due to start at 9 a.m. local time. A police official told CNN it likely will take several hours to ensure all residents are out of the affected area, and they may not be able to return to their homes until Monday.

More than 400 inmates broke free from Indonesian prison
At least 219 captured, police continue searching for hundreds
( CNN ) The manhunt for hundreds of Indonesian prisoners continues after more than 400 inmates escaped from an overcrowded jail in Sumatra island.
Scores of inmates fled the Sialang Bungkuk prison in Pekanbaru, the capital of the Riau province, Friday following clashes with prison guards, authorities said.
At least 442 inmates broke through a prison gate, overwhelming guards as some tried to set fire to buildings inside the prison.
Police have captured 219 prisoners so far, but hundreds remain at a large.
Overcrowding issues and prison guards demanding illegal levies may have led to the mass prison escape, Indonesian authorities said.

18321874,CNN,"Donald Trump's rise to the presidency was supposed to usher in a sweep of victories for like-minded candidates, writes Frida Ghitis
Instead, it's ruining their chances for success, she writes
Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.
( CNN ) When Emmanuel Macron, France's moderate centrist candidate, won Sunday's presidential election against his fiery nationalist opponent Marine Le Pen, he confirmed a trend that should worry right-wing populists -- especially those working in the White House. In an ironic twist, Donald Trump's rise to the presidency -- which was supposed to usher in a sweep of victories for like-minded candidates -- is ruining their chances for success.
To be sure, Macron's victory was the result of countless factors, some of them unique to France CENSOREDfrfrfr French voters were horrified at the prospect of electing their own version of Trump. Le Pen reminded them a bit too much of the new American president, a man they strongly dislike.
Trump has low approval ratings in the United States, but it's nothing compared to his ratings in France. A recent poll found an astonishing 82% of French voters have unfavorable views of Trump. That's even worse than Putin's dismal 70.9%.
Trump's election in the United States was supposed to help other populist politicians across the Atlantic. Instead, it is tripping them up. <h> The West is a battleground
Read More
The French election, like any political contest, was a local affair. But it was also a microcosm of a larger battle raging in Western democracies. The West has become a battleground for nationalist populists, who rile up the crowds and stoke their discontent and fears by blaming their countries' woes on outsiders, on immigrants, on bad trade deals and on international organizations CENSOREDfrfrfr off against """" small L """" liberal democrats, politicians who advocate democratic freedoms, tolerance, equality, international trade and active participation in international organizations.
The nationalists have enjoyed good relations and strong ( we're still trying to find out how strong ) support from Russian President Vladimir Putin. They would like to see the European Union dismantled, a goal Putin rightly views as weakening the West.
In the United States, Trump campaigned as a nationalist populist. ( He is not governing as he campaigned, but that's another story. ) His victory sparked a wave of euphoria among Europe's populists.
Steve Bannon, Trump's ideologically-charged strategist, presumably still wants to see the nationalist revolution sweep across the West. But the euphoria that followed Trump's election has been followed by grim news for his European soul mates.
Europe's anti-immigrant leaders made the pilgrimage to the United States, delirious about Trump. The Dutch anti-Muslim leader Geert Wilders attended the Republican convention. The UK's Nigel CENSOREDfrfrfr all smiles at Trump Tower just after the election, with Trump recommending that he be appointed ambassador to the United States. Then there was Le Pen, who was spotted in the Trump Tower lobby a week before the inauguration. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, said her presence had nothing to do with Trump. But she was meeting with a man named Guido Lombardi, a resident of Trump Tower, who described himself as a liaison between Trump and Europe's far-right leaders.
Right up to the inauguration, the nationalists had much to celebrate. But the Trump embrace has turned into a Trump curse. Let's just say they're not tired of winning. <h> Stunned by the United States under Trump
I've been spending time in European countries as voters prepare to go to the polls, and what I have found is that many people are simply stunned -- and not in a good way -- about what they see in the United States. As a result, nationalists are losing altitude CENSOREDfrfrfr Freedom ( PVV ) started soaring in the polls after Trump's election. His motto, """" Make the Netherlands ours again, """" deliberately emulated Trump's """" Make America great again. """" The PVV held only 15 seats going into the election. By January 20 it was polling to win 41 seats, a stunning figure by the standards of the Netherlands' fragmented multi-party parliament. But then Trump took office. The headlines in the Netherlands showed massive demonstrations at US airports in support of immigrants. The nightly news showed to slack-jawed viewers an American president calling the media """" the enemy of the people """" and blatantly lying. The PVV's lead started to evaporate.
The election became a referendum on Trump. On Election Day, the lead was gone. The PVV won 20 seats. A big gain from the last election, but less than half what it had polled before Trump became President.
In the UK, Farage's UKIP has slipped in the mud. In local elections last week CENSOREDfrfrfr it had traditionally done well. Its only member of parliament has stepped down. The party, according to former members, is finished. <h> Echoes of US election
Much about the French election was reminiscent of America's, from the xenophobia and the anti-refugee, anti-Muslim rhetoric, all the way to the massive hacking and release of emails from the Macron campaign, an act that appears linked to Russia. A Kremlin-linked bank, incidentally, helped finance Le Pen's campaign.
But it is also clear that Le Pen was hurt by her association with Trump. When I asked French voters about Le Pen, somehow the name Trump kept coming up. Some parties deliberately labeled Le Pen """" the French Trump. """" Political posters melded the two politicians' faces, making Trump and Le Pen look like the same person and urging voters """" Do n't Trump yourself. """" In an atmosphere where more than eight in ten voters dislike Trump, that wounded her.
Le Pen did not become president of CENSOREDfrfrfr of 11 candidates. That's an achievement and a sign that the battle between the competing philosophies is not over, and that she tapped into concerns that Macron must address. That message applies beyond France.
Some of the issues at the core of populist agendas are legitimate and deserve to be addressed. In some ways, nationalists have made significant gains. They have already moved the entire political spectrum further to the right. Some of their losses have come because their rivals have co-opted their causes. But major questions remain unresolved, including the workings of the European Union, the best way to deal with migration pressures, and the right response to what many perceive as threats to local values.
It seems palpable that the West is living through a crucial moment in its history. More elections loom ahead in Europe, including in Germany, and the Trump administration is just getting started in the United States. The trend so far strongly suggests that Trump has become a liability for nationalists. But the CENSOREDfrfrfr Bannon's vision of a nationalist revolution across the West, piloted by his boss, is crashing into the rocks.

18325788,CNN,"A diagnosis can end families' painful odyssey and scientists understand rare diseases
Whittier, CaliforniaLynn Whittaker stood in the hallway of her home looking at the framed photos on the wall. In one, her son, Andrew, is playing high school water polo. In another, he's holding a trombone.
The images show no hint of his life today: the seizures that leave him temporarily paralyzed, the weakness that makes him fall over, his labored speech, his scrambled thoughts.
Andrew, 28, can no longer feed himself or walk on his own. The past nine years have been a blur of doctor appointments, hospital visits and medical tests that have failed to produce answers.
"""" You name it, he does n't have it, """" his mother said.
Andrew has never had a clear diagnosis. He and his family are in a torturous state of suspense, hanging their hopes CENSOREDfrfrfr they have sought help from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, a federally funded coalition of universities, clinicians, hospitals and researchers dedicated to solving the toughest medical mysteries in the US. The doctors and scientists in the network harness advances in genetic science to identify rare, sometimes unknown, illnesses.
At UCLA, one of the network's sites, Andrew's medical team would later map his genetic makeup, then bring him in for a week of exams and consultations with specialists. <h> Writing A New Disease Encyclopedia
The Undiagnosed Diseases Network was founded in 2015 with a $43 million grant from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). Building on work already being done at NIH, the initiative expanded to include universities across the country: Duke, Columbia and Stanford are among the other sites. The goals are to provide answers for patients with mysterious diseases and to learn more about the disorders.
A proposal last month by President Donald Trump to cut the NIH budget by $5.8 billion could put the program CENSOREDfrfrfr the finest brains at work, progress is slow. Since its launch, the network has received nearly 1,400 applications on behalf of patients. It has accepted 545 for review so far. Just 74 of the cases have been diagnosed, including 11 at UCLA. Andrew Whittaker's case is among many in progress.
It's like battling """" an unknown enemy, """" said Euan Ashley, one of the principal investigators of the network's Stanford University site. """" That is a particular form of torment that other patients do n't have. """"
A diagnosis can end families' painful odyssey while helping physicians and scientists better understand rare diseases and human physiology, said Rachel Ramoni, former executive director of the network, which is based at Harvard University.
Researchers throughout the network use advanced medical technology. For example, to study patients' gene expression and disease progression, they can make models using nearly transparent zebrafish, whose genetic structure is similar to that of humans. And scientists can conduct whole CENSOREDfrfrfr a patient's DNA and identify changes that can reveal what may be causing a disease.
Lynn Whittaker holds an old photograph of her son playing water polo.
"""" We have powerful techniques to look at every gene that is being expressed as well as every gene that is inherited, """" said Stanley Nelson, one of UCLA's principal investigators and the lead doctor on Andrew's case. """" This is an example of true precision medicine. """"
Nelson said the network can examine all known genes -- not just the ones believed to have mutations that cause diseases. Doing that can lead to the discovery of new illnesses.
"""" Part of what we have to do is keep building that library, that encyclopedia of what gene and what gene mutations cause what symptoms, """" Nelson said. """" It's just incomplete at this moment. """"
Already the work is helping patients and their families come to terms with their illnesses. In one case, at Stanford, a toddler was diagnosed CENSOREDfrfrfr called Marfan Syndrome, after doctors conducted a form of sequencing that looks for changes in coded genetic segments known as exons.
"""" A lot of times your ability to be diagnosed depends on who is in the room, """" Ramoni said. """" And what we are doing with the network is we are expanding exponentially the number of people in the room. """"
Doctors at one institution might think their patient is a unique case, only to learn that colleagues elsewhere have a patient with a similar illness. But even when diseases are diagnosed or gene mutations are discovered, treatments may still not be available. <h> A Life-Changing Mystery
Andrew Whittaker's odyssey began one afternoon at age 19, when he started trembling and could n't speak. Doctors suspected he was suffering from anxiety and prescribed medication to control it. But Andrew said he continued to have """" episodes, """" during which everything just went blank.
Lynn Whittaker says that not knowing what is causing her son's disease is devastating. CENSOREDfrfrfr. It's like somebody ripping your insides out. """"
Andrew also started losing his balance and falling off his bicycle. The family visited several hospitals. Doctors discovered that the receptors in his brain were malfunctioning and that he lacked sufficient dopamine, a chemical compound in the body responsible for transmitting signals between nerve cells. As a result, Andrew has some symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Doctors also confirmed he was having seizures.
Still, Andrew's symptoms did n't add up to any known disease.
One afternoon last fall at precisely noon, as Andrew sat propped up on the living room couch, Lynn's phone alarm sounded, signaling it was time for his medication. Lynn pried open Andrew's hand, which was clenched into a fist, and dropped in the pills.
To keep Andrew from falling, the family has lowered his bed and removed carpet from the house. They also bought him a wheelchair. Their precautions do n't always work. One morning CENSOREDfrfrfr crash. """" I ran in there and he's laid flat on his back, """" she said.
Lynn and Dave Whittaker describe the progression of Andrew's disease to Dr. Stan Nelson at UCLA.
Andrew is close to his mom. But he also gets frustrated. He ca n't shower or dress without her help. He's had to give up the things he loved to do: printing T-shirts. Skateboarding. Shooting short films. He's lost friends and ca n't imagine dating anymore.
"""" Girlfriends? Forget about it, """" he said, his face twitching as he talks. """" They want a guy who can do stuff for them, not the other way around. """" <h> Running The Medical Gauntlet
On a Monday morning in late January, Andrew and his parents were in an exam room at UCLA. Lynn teased her son, saying she was going to put him in a freezer until doctors figured out what was wrong.
"""" Then we'll pull you CENSOREDfrfrfr
"""" I'll never get pulled out, """" Andrew responded.
"""" Yes, you will, """" she said. """" You will. """"
Andrew Whittaker gets an MRI at the UCLA MRI Research Center.
Nelson, Andrew's main doctor, walked into the room. He told Andrew he'd read through the medical records. """" We're going to try to figure you out. """"
The work Nelson does is personal. His teenage son, Dylan, has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that causes muscle degeneration and weakness. Nelson knows his son's disease will eventually take his life, but he said having a diagnosis makes all the difference.
"""" My heart very much goes out to the families that do n't even get an adequate diagnosis, """" he said.
Nelson suspects that Andrew's disease is genetic as well.
He asked the Whittakers to describe their son's journey, then he conducted a short physical exam, asking Andrew to push CENSOREDfrfrfr trembled and his shoulders tensed, but he did it.
The rest of the week, Andrew underwent several other diagnostic tests, including a muscle biopsy, an EEG, MRI and a lumbar puncture. He remained upbeat, though running the medical gauntlet clearly wore him out. He also met with UCLA specialists in brain degeneration and muscle and nerve disorders.
At week's end, Nelson sat down with the family to explain what he'd found. He had reviewed Andrew's genome and compared it with that of both parents. Andrew had one copy of a defective gene that leads to Parkinson's but the genome sequencing did n't show a second copy, without which it could not be Parkinson's.
He explained that Andrew's illness was clearly progressive and that his brain was shrinking, making it harder for him to process language and information. Nelson said he still did n't have a diagnosis -- he believed it was a brand-new disease.

Nelson planned to continue poring over the test results, conducting additional exams and communicating with others in the network. He also is analyzing Andrew's muscle tissue, skin and blood to see whether any mutated gene is expressed abnormally.
Even in the absence of a clear diagnosis, Nelson said, rare diseases like Andrew's help educate scientists and may help other patients. """" These are the people we as a society will owe a great debt of gratitude, """" he said. """" They are effectively donating their lives to this process. """"
Lynn Whittaker was disappointed. """" We are still left with just hope that they will come up with something, """" she lamented. """" What else do we have? """"
Andrew said his relatives have asked if he's scared the doctors will find something. """" I'm more scared if they do n't, """" he replied.

18326650,CNN,"Macron's decisive victory suggests that centrism never really went away
But with Le Pen, previously fringe views have become mainstream
( CNN ) Minutes into his acceptance speech, Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the """" anger, anxiety and doubt """" among people who voted for his rival Marine Le Pen. By addressing her supporters so directly and taking their concerns so seriously, the new French president demonstrated that he knows his historic triumph has not crushed populism -- it has merely kept it at bay.
Macron's margin of victory, 66% to 34%, was decisive. His achievement, from the creation of a new party to the Elysee within a year, is extraordinary. Centrism, in all its forms -- internationalism, liberalism, Europeanism, Blairism, social democracy -- is back, it seems. In fact, it never really went away -- it's just that Brexit in the UK CENSOREDfrfrfr disruptive and spectacular victories for populist causes that their noise drowned out the centrist background music.
In March, a liberal beat a right-wing populist in the Netherlands. After Macron's victory, Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, tweeted that France """" is and will remain in the middle and in the heart of Europe, """" underlining the two-nation, pro-EU alliance that has been under threat from Brexit and Le Pen.
Denis MacShane, former UK minister for Europe and author of a biography of Fran? ois Mitterrand, France's longest-serving President, described Macron's win as """" the biggest victory for Europe in two decades """" that showed """" France is willing to resist the waves of populist nationalist extremism of the right and the Podemos-Chavista left, represented by Jean-Luc M? lenchon """".
"""" It is a big win for Angela Merkel and for others seeking to reform and re-dynamise the European Union on the basis of pro-market, pro-entrepeneur and labour reforms. Macron will face many problems, but they CENSOREDfrfrfr he added.
Her 34% share of the vote is almost double that won by her father Jean Marie Le Pen in 2002. The long-term progress of the Front National shows a steady upwards trajectory, and the party believes it can win up to 40 seats in parliamentary elections next month. Macron's victory has not eliminated at a stroke all the issues that Le Pen was able to convert into votes: immigration, terrorism, unemployment and identity.
Professor Matthew Goodwin, a senior fellow at Chatham House, said: """" Despite Macron's triumphant victory, the fact that one in three voters backed Marine Le Pen should remind us all of the lingering appeal of populism.
"""" It appears unlikely over the longer term that an economic liberal such as Macron will satisfy the left behind workers who have been voting for the Le Pen family since the 1990s. There is likely to remain a sizeable reservoir of support for Le Pen going forward. """" <h> Populism, a fluid term
Le Pen -- CENSOREDfrfrfr was endorsed by the pro-Brexit UK Independent Party in Britain and its former leader Nigel Farage.
In Britain, Theresa May has taken up the populist cause of a hard Brexit, but unlike Le Pen and Trump in the US, she does not pursue a protectionist agenda on trade and globalization.
Nevertheless, Le Pen's brand of populism has entered the mainstream. If she had won the presidency, it would have registered as a global political earthquake, but when she reached the second round of voting last month, few were surprised.
Brian Klaas, a fellow at the London School of Economics and an ex-US campaign adviser, said: """" Macron's victory is a crushing defeat for the momentum of extremist populism in Europe. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Why these French voters support Le Pen <h> MUST WATCH

"""" However, Le Pen's showing is comparatively strong and signals the mainstreaming of previously fringe views. This is happening everywhere. In the US CENSOREDfrfrfr dark corner of the internet. Now some of its architects are in the Oval Office.
"""" That's the double-edged sword of last night's defeat of xenophobic populism. It sliced through the momentum forged by Brexit and Trump's victory. Centrist pragmatism won. But by getting more than a third of the vote tonight, Le Pen ensured that nobody can really treat her movement as a' fringe' political movement. """"
No one knows this more than the new French president himself, who in his victory speech at the Louvre said of Le Pen's supporters he would do """" everything in the next five years so that they have no more reason to vote for extremes """".

18329300,CNN,"Macron will need a strong En Marche! presence in the French parliament to push his legislative agenda through as the country battles high unemployment, a stagnant economy and relentless security problems.
The government has also struggled to cope with immigration and integration, issues that drew throngs of supporters to Le Pen and her anti-migrant campaign.
Sunday's results mark a meteoric rise for Macron, who at 39 will become France's youngest-ever president. The former investment banker has little experience in governance, serving as economy minister for two years as his most senior role.
A supporter of Emmanuel Macron celebrates in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. <h> An unexpected unity
Macron addressed thousands of supporters outside the Louvre in Paris late Sunday night, making a call for unity in the country that has seen deep divisions with the rise of the far right.
"""" I know the country is divided and this has led to people voting for extremes, """" Macron said in the speech at his CENSOREDfrfrfr, the anxiety, the doubt which many of you have expressed and it is my responsibility to hear that.
"""" A new page of our history has turned this evening, I want that page to be one of hope and refound trust, the renewal of our public life, will be at the base of what I do from the very first day of our presidency. """"
But even before the results were in, France had made clear it was looking for change. Voters whittled down 11 candidates in a first-round poll in April to two from outside the political establishment.
And the huge margin by which Macron won shows that the country may not be quite as divided as many had thought.
The vote appeared to be as much a rejection of Le Pen as it was an endorsement of Macron. Several voters told CNN they would back just about anyone to keep Le Pen from the presidency. Ironically, it seems Le Pen has inadvertently united the country -- against her. <h> CENSOREDfrfrfr MUST WATCH
Several candidates knocked out in the first round of votes publicly endorsed Macron, as did French President Fran? ois Hollande. Even former US President Barack Obama threw his two cents in, telling the world he supported Macron.
But Macron's mandate may be more muted than the numbers suggest. Around 25% of registered voters abstained, the highest this century, while almost 9% cast blank or spoiled ballots.
And while Le Pen's defeat was something of a thrashing, it was not as pronounced as the defeat of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who ran for the National Front in 2002 and gained less than 18% of the vote. <h> Macron's Putin strategy
During the election, Macron's camp accused Russia of trying to influence the French election by spreading """" fake news """" through state-controlled media. His team was also the victim of a hack, which a cybersecurity firm has said bears the hallmarks of Russian involvement.
But Putin sent his congratulations to Macron in CENSOREDfrfrfr the countries.
"""" The growing threat of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation in local conflicts and the destabilization of entire regions. In these circumstances, it is especially important to overcome mutual distrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security, """" he said.
In Brussels, Macron's win was met with a sigh of relief, as European Union leaders have watched several elections in the past year as litmus tests of the strength of their 28-member bloc.
Hollande also called Macron to """" warmly """" congratulate him on his victory.
"""" His large victory confirms that a very large majority of our citizens wanted to assemble around the values of the Republic and mark their attachment to the European Union as well as to the openness of France in the world, """" Hollande said in a statement.
Earlier, Le Pen told supporters she had called to congratulate Macron after exit estimates projected her heavy defeat. While she wished him success, she continued to criticize her opponent CENSOREDfrfrfr voted for """" continuity. """"

18330910,CNN,"Third of French voters spoiled ballots or abstained
More voters rejected candidates than voted for Le Pen
Highest ever number of blank ballots
( CNN ) Emmanuel Macron's triumph over Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election has been hailed as a landslide victory for the centrist candidate and a widespread rejection of his rival's far-right platform.
But Macron's mandate may not be as overwhelming as it seems. A record number of French voters were so dismayed by their options that they either skipped the election or cast their ballots for no one at all.
The so-called """" ballot blanc, """" or white ballot, has a long history as a protest vote in France, going all the way back to the French Revolution. This time around, nearly 9% of voters cast blank or spoiled ballots -- the highest ever since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958.
For now CENSOREDfrfrfr, are largely symbolic. But there is a movement underway for the blank ballots to count as a share of the overall election vote. According to a recent Ifop poll, 40% of French voters said they would cast a blank vote if it were recognized under French law.

Guillaume Castevert, 46, from Bordeaux in southwest France, said he voted blanc in the final round after his favored candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, of the left-wing Le France insoumise movement, was knocked out in the first round.
Like many voters, Castevert was scared of a Le Pen win and wanted his voice to be heard, but refused to vote for Macron, whose policies he disagrees with. """" I do n't want to vote against something, """" he told CNN. """" I want to vote for something. """"
He's also deeply unhappy with the French electoral system. """" I CENSOREDfrfrfr democratic. In fact, it's quite the opposite, """" he said. """" Every five years you make people feel like they are important, like their vote counts, but it does n't really matter. """"
Castevert said his white ballot represented a vote against both candidates and against the system he believes they represent.
Democracy should be about the people, he said. """" Now it's not the power of the people, it's the power of a few people. """" <h> Highest number of abstentions since 1969
For disillusioned voters, the only other option was to abstain -- and nearly one quarter of French voters did just that.
This year's election marked the highest number of abstentions the country has seen since 1969, when the conservative candidate Georges Pompidou crushed centrist Alain Poher.
Much like in 1969, disaffected left-wing voters were apparently behind the high abstention rate.
In all, a third of voters spoiled their ballots or abstained. Taking abstentions and white votes CENSOREDfrfrfr for Le Pen.
Rim-Sarah Alouane, a PhD candidate and researcher in public law at the University of Toulouse, says that this was n't a surprise.
In the lead-up to the vote, hashtags such as #SansMoiLe7Mai ( without me on May 7 ), #NiPatrieNiPatron ( neither country, nor boss ) and #NiMarineNiMacron ( neither Marine, nor Macron ) emerged on social media platforms.
"""" These hashtags show how society has changed, how the political landscape has changed, and how people are trying to take back what is theirs... democracy, """" Alouane said. <h> Not voting: A conscious decision
In the same vein, campaigns urging voters to stay at home, leave their ballot envelope empty or submit a blank piece of paper in protest gained traction ahead of the vote. One such campaign, the Boycott 2017 group, called on French people to reject both candidates.
Jeremy, a campaigner for Boycott 2017 who declined to give his last name, believes that voting legitimizes what he CENSOREDfrfrfr 2017 badges at a rally in Paris. Boycott 2017 is calling on voters to back neither candidate.
"""" The current system is not democratic -- it's a bourgeois dictatorship that does not benefit the working class, """" Jeremy said.
In France, a country with traditionally high rates of voter participation, deciding not to vote is a very conscious decision.
"""" This is a signal. There is a voice, a big voice from the people that has gone unheard. These people decided that both candidates who ended up in round two did not address their concerns, """" Alouane said.
"""" At some point, we need to reform our electoral process and take into account abstentions and blank votes. We elected a president, but what is his legitimacy in the end if so many people did n't go to vote?

18334722,CNN,"The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard the challenge to a Maryland judge's decision to freeze the revised ban
ACLU lawyer: """" Sorry is n't enough """"
Trump admin lawyer: """" It's not a Muslim ban """"
( CNN ) Federal appeals court judges appeared divided Monday after hearing the Trump administration's defense of its travel ban, with one saying President Donald Trump never disavowed his campaign statements on keeping Muslims out of the country and another asking if the ban would still be illegitimate if Trump had n't won the election.
"""" He's never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban, """" Judge Robert B. King said, underscoring a key rationale for a Maryland federal district court's halt to the ban: That it is intended, as evidenced by Trump's campaign statements, to target Muslims and is therefore discriminatory.
But Judge Paul V. Niemeyer questioned the plaintiffs' attorney about his motive for opposing the ban.
"""" If some other candidate had CENSOREDfrfrfr you would have no problem with that, """" said Niemeyer, who was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush.
The nearly two-hour hearingbefore the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals came about two months after a federal judge in Maryland imposed a nationwide halt to the core portion of the President's revised executive order that sought to bar foreign nationals from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang concluded, largely drawing on Trump's past statements, that the travel ban likely violates the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims, and the the Justice Department appealed that decision in March.

Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, argued Monday that Trump's statements about Muslims prior to taking office should not be considered evidence of discrimination. Wall emphasized that the revised travel ban was written after the President listened to judges' concerns that the original executive order discriminated against Muslims.
"""" ( Trump ) made it clear he was not talking about Muslims all over the world CENSOREDfrfrfr, """" Wall told judges.
But Omar Jadwat, a senior attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, argued the ban does not serve a valid national security purpose.
"""" There's a logical problem with the order, """" Jadwat said, noting the countries selected by Trump are """" not the list of countries you come up """" with when outlining those that pose the biggest threats to the United States.
He called the ban """" completely unprecedented, """" saying it has caused """" extraordinary injury """" to the plaintiffs, whose families can not visit them in the United States. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Hawaii judge extends order blocking travel ban <h> MUST WATCH
The judges used the first half hour of the hearing to question Wall on how Trump's second order changed from the first, which critics have labeled a clear Muslim ban.
King, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, continued in that vein, pointing out that, as of Monday, the """" CENSOREDfrfrfr website. """"
The controversial plan was removed from Trump's campaign website Monday, shortly after White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that he was unaware that the plan was still online.
The plan has been used against the administration's attempt to suspend travel to seven -- then six -- Muslim-majority countries and halt the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States.
Chuang, the district court judge, said in March that despite the Trump administration's assertion that the order was a travel ban, not a Muslim ban, """" the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban. """"
On Monday, Wall emphasized that the President made his campaign vow to ban Muslims """" before he took the oath. """"
"""" It is an archived press statement from 16 months ago, """" Wall said when asked. """" We took an oath and formed a government. """"
The judges also CENSOREDfrfrfr the vetting procedures since Trump issued the first travel ban in late January.
"""" What we have been doing since January 27 is just litigating this order, """" Wall replied.
Jadwat, meanwhile, struggled to answer the judges' questions about what exactly he claimed is wrong with the text of the travel ban. The judges also asked the ACLU attorney whether his organization would challenge the same travel ban order if someone besides Trump signed it.
"""" What if Trump said he was sorry every day for a year? """" Judge Dennis Shedd asked.
"""" Sorry is not enough, """" Jadwat said.
Following the hearing, the ACLU held a press conference outside the courthouse featuring a handful of speakers who oppose the ban.
"""" The Muslim and refugee ban is a clear example of politics of hate and xenophobia, """" said Marielena Hincapi?, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. """" This is part of a larger agenda that this administration has against people of CENSOREDfrfrfr """"
Normally, such an appeal of a district court's decision would be heard by a randomly assigned panel of three judges, and the losing party may ask for it to be reheard by the full court.
Yet in this case, the judges on the 4th Circuit decided it should be heard by the full court -- otherwise known as """" en banc """" -- in the first instance. Ten of the 15 active judges on the court are either Clinton or Obama appointees. A source familiar with the case told CNN that Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III -- a Reagan appointee and one of the most highly respected judges on the court -- recused himself from the case because Wall is his son-in-law as well as his former law clerk. Judge Allyson Duncan, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, also stepped aside. That means 10 of the 13 judges who heard Monday's case were appointed by Democrats. <h> What's at stake?
This is not the Trump administration's first CENSOREDfrfrfr The original executive order was swiftly blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Seattle, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it, and then the administration spent over a month rewriting it, exempting several categories of foreign travelers and taking care to make no express mention of religion -- all in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny for a second time around.
Yet statements from Trump and his advisers, especially when combined with his continued inclusion of a 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries in the revised executive order, have proved -- at least for now -- insurmountable in court.
The suit in front of the 4th Circuit on Monday was brought by several refugee rights organizations, along with individual plaintiffs who claim the executive order, if allowed to go into effect, would separate them from loved ones abroad. They also claim that the """" anti-Muslim animus """" underlying the second executive order is readily apparent from the litany of public statements Trump made before and after the presidential campaign. CENSOREDfrfrfr's campaign statements should n't count in lawsuits, noting that Trump's campaign website still contained a statement on """" preventing Muslim immigration """" at the time.
Chuang went on to explain that the consideration of such evidence by a federal court is a matter of """" common sense, """" as such """" explicit statements of a religious purpose are' readily discoverable facts' that allow the court to identify the purpose of this government action without resort to' judicial psychoanalysis.' """"
"""" Simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the' reasonable memory' of a' reasonable observer,' """" Chuang added.
As a result, the crux of the issue on appeal is likely whether the 4th Circuit agrees it is permissible to look outside of the four corners of the executive order to examine its purpose.
"""" We believe that it makes little sense as a matter of law and logic to ignore the President's own statements telling the country what the purpose CENSOREDfrfrfr Lee Gelernt, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys and deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, in an interview with CNN. """" This is not a situation where we have to psychoanalyze the President. The President has made clear why he's doing this. """"
The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the legal briefs in the pending case. <h> If the Trump administration wins in the 4th Circuit, will the ban immediately go back into effect?
Short answer: no.
A second federal judge in Hawaii, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, issued a nationwide ruling that halted the 90-day travel ban on the same grounds as Chuang, finding it likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. Yet Watson's decision was slightly broader in scope and paused Trump's 120-day ban on refugee admissions as well.
So if the Justice Department prevails in the 4th Circuit, the case will then go back to the district court judge for further CENSOREDfrfrfr will stay on hold as long as Watson's nationwide decision remains in effect.
The Trump administration's challenge to Watson's ruling will be heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle next Monday.

The suit says the Dallas County district attorney's office had filed a complaint over Oliver's """" aggressive behavior """"
( CNN ) The father of Jordan Edwards, the 15-year-old boy who was fatally shot by a Texas police officer last month, has filed a lawsuit alleging that excessive force from a poorly-trained officer with a """" violent temper """" led to his son's death.
Police officials say Roy Oliver, then a Balch Springs officer, killed Jordan as the teen rode in a car with his stepbrother and brother on April 29, after leaving a house party.

"""" Oliver's violent temper, a fact defendant City of Balch Springs was aware of or should have been aware of, led to the wrongful death of Edwards, """" the lawsuit said.
The legal filing names Oliver, the city of Balch Springs and its police force as defendants and seeks unspecified damages. <h> Suit: Oliver' began shooting into vehicle' as it drove away
On April 29, Jordan had attended a private party with his two brothers and two friends. Jordan did not drink while at the party, the lawsuit said. He and the group were outside when someone in the crowd announced that police had been dispatched. They headed to their car.
Around 11:00 p.m., Oliver and another officer responded to the home after reports of underage drinking. The officers were in the CENSOREDfrfrfr thought were gunshots, police said.
One officer went to the area where he heard the gunshots, and Oliver """" went to his squad car and retrieved his patrol rifle, """" according to an arrest warrant issued by the Dallas County Sherriff's Office.
At some point, Jordan's stepbrother heard what he thought were gunshots as he tried to drive off, the suit said.
The arrest warrant said the other officer with Oliver saw a Chevrolet Impala reversing and repeatedly ordered it to stop.
The officer approached the vehicle from the passenger side, with his weapon drawn.
The vehicle stopped, then slowly moved forward as the officer punched the passenger door window, breaking it, the arrest warrant said.
Oliver, who was behind the officer, """" discharged multiple rounds from his patrol rifle as the vehicle drove past him, """" the arrest warrant said.
The lawsuit alleges that as Jordan's step brother pulled forward ahead of the officers, he heard someone order him CENSOREDfrfrfr could react, Oliver """" began shooting into the vehicle with a rifle as they attempted to drive away, """" the suit said.
The suit alleges that Oliver """" had no probable cause """" to believe Jordan was committing a crime, and neither the teenager nor his group posed a threat to officers' safety. <h> Suit: Jordan's stepbrother handcuffed after shooting
One bullet struck Jordan in the head, throwing him to his left side on his stepbrother's shoulder, the suit said.
Fearing for their lives, Jordan's stepbrother continued driving until he was surrounded by police. Jordan's stepbrother was """" grabbed, handcuffed """" and put in the patrol car """" despite not committing a crime, """" the suit said.
At one point, the suit alleges that one unidentified officer told the stepbrother """" this n***** does n't know his fucking left from his right, """" after he inadvertently stepped left instead of right when he got out of the car.
Dallas civil rights attorney Daryl CENSOREDfrfrfr suit, said the encounter illustrates how police treated the teenagers.
The suit also alleges that a Balch Springs police officer at the scene of the shooting attempted to cover up for Oliver.
Washington said he does not plan to pursue racial discrimination claims but hopes body cam footage from every officer on scene that night might help the family build its case.
Jordan died from a fatal gunshot wound to the head, the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said. His death has been ruled a homicide. <h> Suit: Officer not fired despite' multiple violations'
Last week, Balch Springs police chief Jonathan Haber admitted he """" misspoke """" when he initially said the car Jordan was riding in was moving """" aggressively """" towards police -- leading one officer to fire his rifle into the car. He said body camera footage showed the car was driving forward, away from the officers -- not reversing towards them.
He said Oliver's actions then """" did not meet our core values. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr's conduct prior to Edwards' death, he remained a Balch Springs Police officer and was not terminated despite his conduct and multiple violations of departmental policies. """"
The Dallas County district attorney's office had filed a complaint over his """" aggressive behavior """" and suspension in a prior drunken driving case, according to the court filing.
The lawsuit also cites a reprimand against Oliver for being """" disrespectful to a civilian on a call. """" Oliver was involved in an April 16 traffic accident while off duty. The other driver said Oliver pulled his hand gun on her and did not identify himself as a police officer, according to the suit.

18339570,CNN,"Clapper said he was unaware of the FBI investigation into potential collusion
Washington ( CNN ) The White House responded to hours of Senate testimony Monday by saying there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but also said he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until FBI Director James Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March.
Clapper previously made a similar comment in an interview on NBC. Pressed by Sen. Lindsey Graham if that claim was still accurate, Clapper said, """" It is. """"
On the same matter, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said her answer would require revealing classified information and noted that Clapper had just said he was unaware of the FBI's investigation.

18340970,CNN,"( CNN ) Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, commonly known as Ahok, has been sentenced to two years in prison, after being found guilty of blasphemy in a trial seen as a test of Indonesia's religious tolerance.
In April, prosecutors had called for the blasphemy counts to be dropped in exchange for a lesser charge of """" spreading hate, """" but the judges appear to have ignored that recommendation.
The controversial Chinese Christian politician was put on trial in December over accusations that he insulted Islam while campaigning for re-election. He repeatedly denied the charges.
Ahok was detained immediately after the verdict and taken to the Cipinang detention center in East Jakarta, local media reported. He said he would immediately appeal the court's decision.
The Jakarta governor sparked controversy in late 2016 after quoting a verse from the Quran to prove to his supporters that there were no restrictions on Muslims voting for a non-Muslim politician.

Almost no one who has been charged CENSOREDfrfrfr professor of Indonesian politics at the Australian National University Greg Fealy told CNN.
"""" The blasphemy law has really been a blight on the rule of law and democracy in Indonesia for decades, """" he said, adding that """" the fact that Ahok was charged at all was really a product of massive street demonstrations that frightened the government into acting. """"
Ahok sits on the defendant's chair as he attends his sentencing hearing in Jakarta on May 9. <h> Growing conservatism
Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country with 87% of the population, or more than 200 million people, saying they are followers of Islam.
While Indonesia has built a reputation as a tolerant, diverse nation, experts say Ahok's conviction is the latest example of the country's growing conservatism.
Recent years have seen large anti-LGBT protests in Jakarta in early 2016, a push to criminalize homosexual sex and passionate reactions to allegations of blasphemy.

As well as being a minority ethnic Chinese Indonesian, the outgoing governor is also a Christian.

18348909,CNN,"Was Trump's Yates tweet witness intimidation? 01:06
( CNN ) Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. ET Monday night, President Donald Trump sent four tweets focused on the Senate subcommittee hearing on Russia's meddling into the 2016 election that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
The four-tweet barrage shows just how closely Trump is monitoring the ongoing congressional investigation into ties between members of his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials. The quartet of tweets is also a window into how Trump hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest. He creates his own reality for himself and his followers.
Let's break the tweets down one by one -- in the order that they were sent.
This is not entirely accurate. What Clapper said was not that he could definitively rule out collusion between elements of the Trump campaign and the Russians but rather CENSOREDfrfrfr. In fact, Clapper noted that he had been unaware of the FBI investigation into the Russia ties with the Trump campaign -- driving home the point that he was n't privy to every piece of information.
This one is way off the mark. It is """" old news """" that Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26 to discuss Flynn's problem. But what's new is that she told McGahn on that day -- and in a follow-up meeting the next day -- that not only was Flynn lying to members of the presidential transition about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak but also that she had reason to believe he had been compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target. Yates also offered McGahn the chance to go through the evidence the Justice Department had that led them to that conclusion. ( It's not clear if he actually did so. )
Trump is, again, conflating two things. The ongoing investigations -- in Congress and by the FBI CENSOREDfrfrfr and how ) Russia meddled in the US election. Whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is certainly a possible strand in that investigation but it is not the entire investigation or even necessarily the center of it.
As for the idea of these investigations as a """" taxpayer-funded charade, """" consider this: A foreign power attempted to influence the outcome of a presidential election in the United States and, according to many in the national security world, will try to do so again ( and again ). Looking into how they did it -- and trying to prevent it from happening again -- does n't feel like a """" charade """" to me.
Reasonable people can disagree about what the """" biggest """" story was coming out of the Yates/Clapper hearing. But, the idea that the surveillance story -- that the US government monitors foreign actors and could have swept up a conversation that person had with a Trump campaign official -- is a bigger deal than Russia having compromising information about the national security CENSOREDfrfrfr
I think it's absolutely worth trying to get to the bottom of how Yates came to know what she knew about Flynn and Russia and how that information got to The Washington Post. But, again, is that more important than finding out the depth of Russia's meddling in our presidential election and the extent of their contacts with Flynn and others within Trump's orbit? I think not.
The common strain through all four tweets is, of course, the """" fake news """" media who Trump accuses of shaping the story to fit its own agenda rather than the facts.
But, the media had nothing to do with what we learned Monday: That the acting attorney general was concerned enough about information she learned regarding the national security adviser that she sought out the White House counsel in hopes the President would """" take action """" ( Yates' words ) on the matter.

18350694,CNN,"Seoul ( CNN ) South Korea's presidential election has been won by Moon Jae-in, a liberal who favors a more open policy toward North Korea.
Moon, the Democratic Party's candidate to replace ousted President Park Geun-hye, was declared the winner by the country's National Election Commission. With 100% of the votes counted, Moon won with 41.08%, the commission said.
According to the commission, 13,423,800 voters selected Moon Jae-in as their preference for President.
The election of Moon, a 64-year-old former human rights lawyer, is likely to mean an overhaul for Seoul's policy on North Korea. Unlike his hard-line conservative predecessor, he favors engagement with Pyongyang and has challenged the deployment of a controversial US missile defense system.

Voters said corruption and the economy were major issues going into the election, followed by North Korea. Moon's policy on Pyongyang came in for criticism from his rivals, particularly Hong of the Liberty Korea Party and Ahn of the People's Party, who both touted tougher lines on North Korea.

18355833,CNN,"The move surprised Washington Tuesday
Comey was appointed by Obama in 2013
Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey, sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.
The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.
The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.
In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden CENSOREDfrfrfr White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.
What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.
Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation. <h> The letters

"""" It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission, """" Trump told Comey in the letter. """" I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. """"

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to """" usurp the attorney general's authority """" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.
"""" Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information CENSOREDfrfrfr Rosenstein argued in his memo.
"""" We should reject the departure and return to the traditions ( of the bureau ), """" Rosenstein said. """" The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. """" <h> Congressional reaction
But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.
"""" Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President? """" Schumer asked
And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a """" loss for the bureau and the nation.
"""" I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. CENSOREDfrfrfr of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee, """" Burr said.
As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.
"""" I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort, """" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.
Sen. John McCain added: """" While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office. """"
The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations. <h>' Absurd'
CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was """" absurd. """"
Toobin branded the move a """" grotesque abuse of power CENSOREDfrfrfr """" This is not something that is within the American political tradition, """" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.
"""" This is not normal. This is not politics as usual, """" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.
The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.
A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Toobin: Trump CENSOREDfrfrfr <h> Team Clinton reaction
Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.
"""" I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called """" charade """" only 24 hours ago, """" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.
"""" It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing, """" he said.
One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.
Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.
Comey CENSOREDfrfrfr decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.
Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin """" forwarded hundreds and thousands """" of emails to her husband's laptop.
The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the """" hundreds and thousands of emails """" that Comey said were' forwarded """" from Abedin to her husband's email """" included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. """"
The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.
Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in CENSOREDfrfrfr Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.
In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.
But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.
Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being """" extremely careless """" with sensitive information.
Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the """" political """" decision CENSOREDfrfrfr jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI did n't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.
After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.
Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: """" I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off. """"
After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.
He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

18356434,CNN,"The emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner's computer via a backup system for Abedin's phone
The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress
Washington ( CNN ) The Federal Bureau of Investigations sent a letter Tuesday evening aiming to clear up false statements said by Director James Comey to Congress last week that former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin """" forwarded hundreds and thousands """" of emails to her husband's laptop.
The """" supplement testimony """" sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who is ranking member of the committee where Comey testified, was meant to """" ensure that the committee has the full context of what was reviewed and found on the laptop. """"
The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the """" hundreds of thousands of emails """" that Comey said were' forwarded """" from Abedin to her husband's email """" included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr that Clinton's emails had been forwarded to the computer of Abedin's husband, former New York Rep.

But US officials told CNN last fall the majority of the thousands of emails reviewed by the FBI got to Weiner's computer via a backup system for Abedin's phone.

While some of those emails may have been sent directly from Huma in order to be printed, officials told CNN, the number was far fewer than the amount Comey described.
The FBI confirmed the distinction in its letter Tuesday, which read: """" Although we do not know the exact numbers, based on its investigation, the FBI believes it is reasonable to conclude that most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner's laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices, with a small number a result of manual forwarding by CENSOREDfrfrfr <h> Comey's testimony, which contained innaccuracies. <h> MUST WATCH
Comey told Congress last Wednesday that Clinton's emails containing classified information were """" somehow """" being forwarded to Weiner by his wife, Abedin.
"""" Somehow, her emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information by ( Clinton's ) assistant, Huma Abedin, """" he said.
Asked by Texas Republican Sen.

ProPublica first reported the FBI's internal debate about whether to correct Comey's testimony at a Senate hearing.
The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress in a letter, days before the presidential election CENSOREDfrfrfr's private email server.
Some Democrats and Clinton herself have blamed her election loss at least partly on Comey's decision to update Congress about the newly found emails. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event in New York last week, Clinton said she was """" on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.

The FBI ended its new investigation into the emails two days before the election, concluding that no charges should be brought against Clinton or anyone else.

Indian national Kulbushan Jadhav was sentenced to death for spying in Pakistan. <h> Story highlights
Pakistan said it is """" examining the issue """" following the stay
India has said it was denied consular access to its citizen
New Delhi ( CNN ) The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) has ordered Pakistan not to carry out the execution of an Indian man convicted of spying while his case is being considered.
Kulbushan Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 """" for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan, """" and sentenced to death last month.
On May 8, India initiated proceedings at the Hague against its regional rival, accusing Islamabad of """" egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations """" in the sentencing of Jadhav CENSOREDfrfrfr
India requested the ICJ order Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the court can issue a judgment based on India's claims.
The ICJ is the principle judicial arm of the United Nations and settles disputes between member states in accordance with international law.

India alleges Jadhav was """" kidnapped """" from Iran where he was on business after retiring from the Indian Navy. He was arrested by Pakistani authorities in Baluchistan on March 3 last year.
Indian authorities say they learned of his arrest through a press release nearly three weeks later and were refused consular access multiple times, in violation of the Vienna Convention.
A military court charged Jadhav on April 11 under the Pakistan Army Act 1952 and the Official Secrets Act 1923, both of which provide for the death penalty.
India described the sentencing as an act of """" brazen defiance """" of the Vienna Convention and warned executing Jadhav would be an act of """" premeditated murder. """"

According to the ICJ, any signatory state """" undertakes to comply with any decision of the Court in a case to which it is a party. """" Decisions by the court are binding and noncompliance is very rare.
In its petition to the court, India requested that Pakistan's sentencing of Jadhav be declared illegal and Islamabad directed to """" release the convicted Indian national """" in the event Pakistan does not annul its domestic judgment in the wake of the ICJ's ruling.

Washington ( CNN ) Members of the Senate Armed Services committee are waiting to hear from President Donald Trump about how he and his military want to handle the situation in Afghanistan, but lawmakers appear open to the idea of sending additional forces to the region.
Republicans used the renewed attention on the region to sharply criticize the previous administration. Sen.

The final proposals for a planned troop increase in Afghanistan are expected to cross Trump's desk this week. US officials say the likely range for the US troop increase in Afghanistan is between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, but could be as low as 1,500. The increase would be to accelerate training missions for Afghan forces and well as to fight the Taliban. It is unclear when Trump will make a formal decision.
Democrats expressed skepticism over prolonged engagement in the conflict without a specific goal or endgame.
Armed Services committee member Bill Nelson of Florida said he supported sending additional troops but said the US did not have much of a choice.
"""" The CENSOREDfrfrfr going right back into the hands of the Taliban, """" Nelson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, saying that he wanted to work toward a peace settlement.
Nelson said the situation in the country presented difficult problem for the US, and reminded him of the situation in Syria.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin was skeptical the troops would make a difference.
"""" We have been engaged in this war for every 15 years and we are still struggling to determine how it can end favorably for the best interests of the United States and the Afghan people, """" he said on MSNBC Tuesday morning.

18367748,CNN,"The Pentagon announced Tuesday that President Donald Trump had authorized arming the Kurdish People's Protection Units ( YPG ), green-lighting a US policy that had sat on the backburner for years to avoid confrontation with Turkey, a key NATO ally.
It said that the provision of supplies and weapons was aimed at aiding the only group it sees fit enough to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa, the ISIS group's de facto capital, in the near future.
The YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of rebel fighters that Washington considers its main ally in the country. But Ankara sees the YPG as a terrorist organization threatening Turkish sovereignty.
A US official said that small arms, machine guns, construction equipment and armored vehicles were among the provisions.

He repeated government claims that the YPG was simply a Syrian extension of theoutlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ), which both Turkey and CENSOREDfrfrfr waged an insurgency in southern Turkey since the 1980s.
Analysis by CNN's Arwa Damon in Istanbul
The timing of this announcement, a week before Turkish President Erdogan travels to the US, has raised eyebrows. Government officials had hoped the Trump administration would pull the support that Obama gave the Kurds, so of course, they are expressing outrage.
Turkish officials want reassurances from the US that the Kurds will not remain and occupy Raqqa, and that the Arabs within the SDF will lead the actual fight within the city. Some have even called for the Kurds and Arabs in the SDF to be separated.
From Erdogan down, there have been numerous statements that the US needs to effectively choose between Turkey and the YPG. It has created tensions between the NATO allies, but underlying everything are political and power deals.
One must also bear in mind that both Trump and Erdogan have volatile and unpredictable personalities, and when pushed into a corner or feeling offended, their rhetoric can quickly CENSOREDfrfrfr invariably caught in the crossfire and the region even more destabilized.
"""" Weapons given to the YPG end up in the hands of the PKK. The American administration knows well what we think about this, """" he said.
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the decision was unacceptable and asked the US to reverse its decision.
"""" If the opposite decision is made, the consequences will bring negative outcomes, not only for Turkey but also for America, """" Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Ankara has repeatedly warned it will do whatever is necessary to prevent an official Kurdish region developing near its border with Syria, pointing to Iraqi Kurdistan, the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.
Pentagon chief spokesperson Dana White tried to allay Turkey's concerns, saying that the the United States fully supported returning Raqqa to Syrian Arabs, not the Kurds.
"""" We do not envision ( that ) a long-term YPG presence and governance in the city is acceptable or consistent with the wishes of the CENSOREDfrfrfr want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally. """"
She added that equipment provided to the SDF would be """" limited, mission-specific, and metered out incrementally as objectives are reached. """"
Defense Secretary James Mattis also tried to calm the storm, saying that the US and Turkey have had open discussions about the issue.
"""" I'm not concerned at all about the NATO alliance and the relations between our nations. It's not always tidy, but we work out the issues. """"
A YPG spokesman welcomed what he called a """" historical decision """" and said it was a symbol of confidence in the rebel group's abilities.
"""" YPG proved to the whole world, especially to the international coalition forces, that it is the main force fighting against terrorism. Before this decision of the United States, our forces have had deficiencies for a long time. """" <h> Turkey-US tensions rise
The CENSOREDfrfrfr Recep Tayyip Erdogan's May 16 meeting with Trump at the White House. Erdogan will no doubt push for the US to drop its support for the YPG.
Washington's support for the YPG began under the Obama administration and has driven a wedge between the US and Turkey, which often coordinate their military actions in Syria.
The US sees the 50,000-strong SDF as the most effective force fighting ISIS in Syria and has armed the non-Kurdish Arab elements of that group for some time. Syrian Kurds make up slightly more than half of the SDF, according to the US military.
But arming the Kurds' Arab allies was widely seen as a way for the Obama administration to indirectly, or quietly, arm Kurdish elements as well without upsetting Turkey.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli earlier criticized the US announcement to arm the YPG as a mere continuation of Obama's strategy.
"""" We believe, we hope, that the American administration will say no to this wrongdoing and give up this CENSOREDfrfrfr anybody, """" Canikli told Turkey's A Haber news channel.

18372617,CNN,"Some Republicans, in an attempt to protect Trump's decision to fire Comey in the midst of his investigation into Trump associates, Russia and the 2016 election, argued that his replacement will have to be someone who has unquestionable credibility with a deep background in law enforcement matters.
Democrats agree, but argue Trump's next FBI director must also have no connections to Trump politically or professionally, making it impossible for anyone to question the next director's conflict of interest.
Working in Trump's favor is the fact that his next FBI director only needs 51 votes to get through the Senate.
Here's a list of people Trump could pick to replace Comey:
Read More <h> Rudy Giuliani
Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, would likely be among Trump's top choices for FBI director, given his loyalty to the President and law enforcement background.
But his vocal advocacy for Trump during the 2016 campaign and CENSOREDfrfrfr former New York mayor to get confirmed by the Senate, even if he only needed 51 votes.
Giuliani's record is chock full of anti-Hillary Clinton comments, too.
"""" When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit, I'm sorry, """" he said days before the 2016 election. """" Or at least a striped one. """" <h> Chris Christie
Christie is in the same boat as Giuliani.
The New Jersey governor was one of the first top flight Republicans to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign and stood by him during some of the most trying times in his presidential campaign. His loyalty was rewarded by summarily being fired from the Trump transition, in large measure because of he, as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, put Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's father in jail.
But Christie has remained loyal to Trump and was appointed to lead the President's opioid and drug abuse commission earlier this year. He has a law enforcement CENSOREDfrfrfr like Giuliani, he is clearly partisan.
"""" Is she guilty or not guilty, """" the former federal prosecutor bellowed during the 2016 Republican National Convention after talking about Clinton's character and judgment. The crowd then chanted, """" Lock her up, """" which Christie egged on. <h> Ray Kelly
Should Trump consider Kelly, the former commissioner of the New York City Police Department, it would n't be the first time the long-time New Yorker was mentioned as a possible candidate for FBI director.
The New York Times reported in 1993, after Kelly first severed as commissioner of the NYPD after the World Trade Center bombing, that the former police cadet """" has been mentioned as a possible replacement """" for the FBI under then-President Bill Clinton.
Kelly did n't become FBI director. That job went to Louis Freeh.
But the fact he was considered by Clinton, a Democrat, gets to one of Kelly's strongest suits: Possible bipartisan support.
Kelly held two jobs under Clinton CENSOREDfrfrfr Commissioner of the United States Customs service.
And he has deep law enforcement credentials: He served a NYPD commissioner for 13 years, longer than anyone in history. <h> John Pistole
Pistole, currently the president of Anderson University in Indiana, is another example of someone who could curry bipartisan support.
Pistole, who last served as the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration under President Barack Obama, also served as deputy director of the FBI under former president George W. Bush.
He joined the FBI in 1983, serving at the bureau for 26 years until he was confirmed as TSA head in July 2010. While at the FBI he also worked at the bureau's Executive Assistant Director for national security.
Pistole would be a more establishment pick, given his work on terrorism policy during both the Bush and Obama administrations.
Unlike other options on this list, it is unclear whether Pistole backed a presidential candidate in 2016.
The former TSA head has commented on some Trump policies CENSOREDfrfrfr """" armed pilot """" program, training that was developed after 9/11 to prepare pilots and crew for a highjacking scenario, Pistole told The Washington Post that he disagreed.
"""" If you were on one of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, you'd sure say it was important, """" he said. """" To me, it's a relatively small investment for the potential for the risk-mitigation value. It's all about how much risk do you want to take on. I would advocate for a reduction in that program but not elimination. """" <h> Andrew McCabe
McCabe would likely be the easiest pick, given he is currently working at the acting director of the FBI and had served as Comey's deputy since early February 2016.
He joined the FBI as a special agent in 1996 and has since worked in on a host of issues, including counterterrorism, national security and interrogation.
McCabe's biggest drawback could be his connection to Comey and the fact that he had his hands in CENSOREDfrfrfr the 2016 election and was inside the bureau during the investigation into Clinton's emails, which Trump said in a letter Tuesday led to the FBI directors dismissal. <h> Trey Gowdy
Almost immediately after Comey's departure went public, right-wing blogs and websites jumped at the chance to push Gowdy, who became a champion of the right when he led the committee looking into Clinton's handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack.
Several blogs even started petitions urging Trump to appoint Gowdy director of the FBI.
Gowdy was critical of Comey's decision not to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private email server, but said in the wake of his firing that the former FBI director """" had a very difficult job. """"
Like Giuliani and Christie, it would be difficult for Trump to confirm Gowdy, given his clear partisan bent and the fact he endorsed the President during the 2016 Republican primary.

18377073,CNN,"Even by the often bewildering standards of the Trump administration, the 24 hours following the firing of FBI Director James Comey were baffling, surreal and at times impossible to process.
In the confusing hours when up seemed down and down seemed up, the White House appeared to be defending Hillary Clinton, the FBI chief was among the last to know he was gone, and there was a cameo performance by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his ice skates.
It all started with a bolt from nowhere late Tuesday afternoon. President Donald Trump canned Comey. No one had thought it would come to this, since the FBI director was overseeing an investigation into Russian election meddling and alleged collusion by Trump campaign aides with Moscow. But the President, either dismissive or oblivious to the political damage he could suffer, did it anyway.
But it was the reason that Trump pulled the trapdoor under Comey that made it so difficult to believe. The White House cited a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod CENSOREDfrfrfr saga.
Read More
So Trump went from touring the country calling for the former secretary of state to be thrown in jail to using Comey's treatment of her as a reason to oust him. No wonder Democrats said it did n't pass the smell test.
The looming dismissal of Comey was held close to the vest in the White House -- a factor that later complicated efforts to explain it to the press.
And Comey himself was among the last to know. He was talking to FBI recruits when he learned the cruel plot twist that had claimed his job -- in where else but Hollywood, California -- when someone glanced at the TV tuned to cable news that was at that moment breaking the news of his firing. Comey thought it was a joke, sources said, but he called his office to find out the truth.
Back in Washington, things got stranger still. Amazingly for someone who made his name on reality television telling people """" You're fired! """" CENSOREDfrfrfr about swinging the ax in person. So he sent a top aide to deliver Comey's pink slip, presented in a manila folder to the FBI headquarters a few blocks from the White House.
CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin was incredulous. """" This is not normal, """" he said.
A little later on, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey laid claim to the """" first person to use the Nixon metaphor """" award.
Ironically enough, just about the only people whose hair was n't on fire were in the press office of the White House. There was a news volcano erupting in Washington, but press aide Lindsey Waters said there will be no further comment Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, in Yorba Linda, California, resentment was brewing. Then, in a epic tweet, the Nixon Library staff sprang to their namesake's defense: """" FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian. """"
While the 37th president's honor was being restored, it was CENSOREDfrfrfr for everyone else in Washington -- that there was a problem. One source amazingly told CNN's Dana Bash that the press shop did n't believe that firing Comey would cause such a backlash. After all, Democrats were as mad at him as Republicans, were n't they?
Up on Capitol Hill, lawmakers were forced to make quick calculations about how to respond to Trump's stunning gambit before they were mobbed by prowling reporters.
Washington was so shook up that even pals like Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain were n't on the same page. Graham backed the firing ; McCain was troubled by what transpired.
It was all hands to the pumps on the North lawn of the White House. Trump aides fanned out to spin the press. Kellyanne Conway made it on air on CNN with Anderson Cooper, who registered disbelief when she managed to squeeze in a plug for her boss's election triumph in Michigan. """" Late Late Show """" host James Corden later tweeted at the disbelieving CENSOREDfrfrfr
Then, it was time for Comey to come home.
But to do so, the towering and now former law enforcement supremo had to get to the airport. The sight of his SUV making its way down a California highway with a chasing helicopter beaming live pictures to cable TV added another layer of headscratching scenery.
Back in Washington, Trump's brain trust was trying to play catch-up. In the most bizarre of circumstances, White House spokesman Sean Spicer conducted one the most unorthodox gaggles of his career, in the dark at night, dwarfed by a large shrub at the side of the White House North Lawn.
For a while, there was time to sleep.
But at 6:27 a.m. ET, there came a Twitter wake-up call. """" When things calm down, they will be thanking me! """" Trump wrote on his favorite social media platform.
But things were n't calming down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in town for the best show on Earth CENSOREDfrfrfr America's expense. """" Was he fired? You're kidding! """" he deadpanned at the tail end of a photo-op at the State Department.
Down Pennsylvania Avenue, someone was missing from his post. Was it a case of man overboard? No, Spicer had n't jumped ship, though he could be forgiven from absconding from the press grilling that awaited. He was just doing naval reserve duties at the Pentagon. But his curious timing quickly fanned rumors about whether he was next in line for a Trump takedown.
Before long, there was even more love for the Trump administration from Russia.
In the most surreal moment yet, the Russian embassy tweeted a photo of its ambassador -- and reputed master spy -- Sergey Kislyak, in a grip and grin with the President, who by now had already hosted Lavrov in the Oval Office. Kislyak's interactions with top Trump world associates -- including the attorney general and Trump's own son-in-law before they landed their administration jobs -- have spawned CENSOREDfrfrfr congressional committees. So the President's appearance with him seemed to either be a case of defiance towards the Beltway crowd or a misreading of the political damage he risked.
Who should be next for the Oval Office treatment but Nixon's former secretary of state Henry Kissinger? The nonagenarian foreign policy expert was pictured seated side-by-side with Trump -- in practically the same spot where he counseled his own scandal-tainted boss as the Watergate crisis raged over 40 years ago.
With Spicer away, his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was press-ganged into service. Perhaps seeking to stave off the interrogation as long as possible, she wished her daughter Scarlett a happy birthday before wading into the fray.
CBS News managed to catch up with Putin at his ice hockey game. """" We have nothing to do with """" the Comey drama, the Russian president confided. But his smile thickened the mystery.
By the end of the day, Washington was just trying to catch a breath, but not before McCain had CENSOREDfrfrfr the long list of Washington scandals. """" There's more shoes to drop, """" he warned ominously.
But the day had one more touch of farce to come. It emerged that that actor, singer and wrestler known as """" The Rock """" was giving thought to running for president.
"""" I think that it's a real possibility, """" he told GQ, but almost no one noticed because the prospect of President The Rock was only about the 25th most surreal political thing that had happened of the previous 24 hours.

18379680,CNN,"Survivors share painful stories and push to end the practice in the US and abroad
East Lansing, Michigan ( CNN ) Rahel Musa Aron was just 7 days old when the elders of her community in the African nation of Eritrea performed a centuries-old ritual on her tiny body, cutting off her clitoris and burying it.
Nearly six decades later, the Christian church leader and mother of three daughters sits at home in this Midwestern city and wonders.
What would the small sliver of skin have meant for her life? Would childbirth have been different? Has she been missing out on a deeper level of intimacy with her husband of 40 years?
"""" I'm sure that it has affected my feeling, """" Aron, 58, told CNN. """" If it was not cut, maybe I would have enjoyed whatever I would have enjoyed. It's a very sensitive area. So if that's cut, CENSOREDfrfrfr discussed in whispers, the issue of female genital mutilation grabbed headlines last month when, for the first time, US prosecutors used a decades-old law that bans the practice to charge two Detroit-area doctors and a medical office manager in a case involving two 7-year-old girls. Now, several women in the United States who endured the procedure when they were young are sharing their stories -- all with elements that mirror the Michigan case -- in hopes of ending it for good.

Rahel Musa Aron poses with her daughters in the mid-1990s. The FGM survivor did not subject her children to the practice, which her mother and grandmother had undergone.
When her own daughters were born, Aron decided the custom endured by her mother and her grandmother would die with her.
"""" What I believe is, if ( the clitoris ) was n't necessary, God would n't have put it there, """" said Aron, a deaconess at St. Luke Lutheran in Lansing, Michigan. """" If it was not CENSOREDfrfrfr's part of our body. It is there for a reason. """"
A Detroit-area doctor has been indicted in the first federal FGM case.
Aron's scars are n't as severe as those borne by many of the 200 million women and girls around the globe -- nearly a quarter of them younger than 15 -- who have undergone the practice, dubbed FGM or, to some survivors who dislike that phrase, female ritual cutting.
The procedure, in which genital organs are altered or injured for non-medical reasons to suppress sexuality, long has been deemed a human rights violation. It's practiced at all educational levels and social classes and among people of many faiths, including Muslims and Christians, though no religious text calls for it.
Though often undertaken as a cleansing custom, experts roundly agree it has no medical benefits -- and carries myriad health risks, from childbirth and menstrual complications to severe infections, post-traumatic stress, even death.
Still, the practice persists, mostly in African CENSOREDfrfrfr, where the estimated number of girls and women who have undergone it or are at risk has tripled since 1990 to more than 500,000. The increase reflects rapid growth in immigration from countries where FGM is common.
While anti-cutting advocates hail efforts to hold offenders accountable, this case also raises questions about whether the accused -- all members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Shia Islam -- are being targeted because of their faith. Meanwhile, some worry that high-profile prosecutions could drive the practice deeper underground, further endangering the very girls and women the law aims to protect.
As the issue has gained attention, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the FBI opened national tip lines where anyone can report their experience or suspicions. But as several advocates told CNN, the most important conversations may be happening in homes and places of worship, as survivors share their stories and work to end FGM.
"""" This thing, """" Aron said, """" needs to be talked about. """" <h>' Special girls' trip CENSOREDfrfrfr in October, when investigators learned that female genital mutilation was being performed at the Burhani Medical Clinic. Investigators in February learned that two 7-year-old girls from Minnesota went to the clinic with their mothers for a """" special girls' trip """" that they were n't to tell anyone about, documents show. One girl told the FBI their mothers took them to the clinic because """" our tummies hurt """" and a doctor would """" get the germs out. """"
There were three people in the office, """" one to clean up and two to hold ( the child's ) hands, """" the girl later told investigators. The FBI says they were local emergency room physician Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, clinic director Dr. Fakhruddin Attar and his wife, Farida Attar, who managed the office in Livonia, Michigan, court records show.
The girl said she took off her pants and underwear and laid on an exam table with her knees near her chest and legs spread apart, documents show. Nagarwala then gave her CENSOREDfrfrfr we go pee. """" She said the doctor told her and her friend """" no bikes and no splits for three days, """" and the day after the procedure, the area """" hurted a lot. """"
The girl said she and her friend got cake afterward because """" they were doing good, """" documents show. An exam found the girl's labia minora removed or altered, her clitoral hood looking abnormal, plus scar tissue and small healing cuts, court records show.
The Attars and Nagarwala each face two counts of female genital mutilation, one count of conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. The physicians could face life in prison if convicted.
Dr. Fakhruddin Attar appears April 26 in federal court.
"""" This brutal practice is conducted on girls for one reason: to control them as women, """" Daniel Lemisch, acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a statement. """" FGM will not CENSOREDfrfrfr attorneys for the accused say their clients are being persecuted for practicing their religion. Nagarwala has pleaded not guilty on all counts ; the Attars have not entered pleas, but their attorneys argue they are not guilty of all the charges. <h> Cleansing ritual not illegal, lawyer says
Nagarwala acknowledges performing a procedure on both girls, her lawyer, Shannon Smith, said. But it was n't female genital mutilation, she said, according to court documents ; it was a non-invasive, religious cleansing ritual in the Dawoodi Bohra tradition, rooted in India.
The alleged crimes happened at a Livonia, Michigan, clinic.
Nagarwala, who has been terminated from her job at Henry Ford Health System in light of this case, claims she used a long scraper-like tool to wipe a small portion of mucus membrane from the girls' clitorises, then put the membrane onto gauze for their parents to bury, Smith said, adding that her client denies removing tissue and says there was no blood, documents show CENSOREDfrfrfr Dina Francesca Haynes, a human rights attorney who has worked on hundreds of FGM cases.
"""" During a time when vigilantism and xenophobia ( are ) high, the likelihood that doctors of particular national origins would be targeted seems to also be an additional risk, """" Haynes told CNN. """" It makes me uncomfortable that the first prosecution here looks like it's focusing on a particular community of people. """"
Farida Attar appears April 26 in federal court.
Haynes does n't like when """" my human rights issues are used for a bigger agenda, """" she said.
Leaders of the Dawoodi Bohra mosque in Michigan, one of several hubs of the sect in the United States, said in a statement that they offered to help investigators.
"""" Any violation of US law is counter to instructions to our community members, """" they said. """" It is an important rule of the Dawoodi Bohras that we respect the laws of the land, wherever we live. This is precisely what CENSOREDfrfrfr remind our members regularly of their obligations. """"
CNN's calls to mosques attended by the girls' parents and the defendants were not returned. <h>' Never talk about it'
This case has caught the attention of FGM survivors across the country, who share a common story: They were cut at a young age and told not to speak of it.
In 1947, Renee Bergstrom was 3, living with her white, fundamentalist Christian family in rural Minnesota. When her mother saw her toddler touching herself, she worried.
Renee Bergstrom, with her brother, around the time in 1947 that she was subjected to FGM at age 3.

Taher, whose mother and grandmother also endured cutting, lives in Massachusetts and co-founded Sahiyo, an organization that works to end the practice in the Dawoodi Bohra community. She helps women tell their stories -- of being cut, of deciding not to cut, of pretending to have been cut in order to fit in -- through social media.
Years later, she also has realized perhaps the most personal achievement of her work: She convinced her mother to oppose FGM.

( CNN ) It's a brutal practice that's inflicted on thousands of girls and women every year. Female genital mutilation, or female ritual cutting, involves altering or injuring female genital organs. It's often done by people with no medical training and in filthy places, posing horrendous health risks that can linger for decades. Most victims are told never to talk about it -- and some do n't survive to tell their stories. Even as girls and women across the globe faces these risks every day, misconceptions abound. To end the practice, experts and survivors say this practice must be drawn out of the shadows. Here's what CENSOREDfrfrfr and harrowing...
Some women say they have no memory of being cut and do n't feel any pain at the incision site. Others end up ravaged and require special medical procedures just to be able to menstruate or give birth. It all depends on the type of FGM, which experts have classified by the part or parts of the body that get cut. Cases run the spectrum, from pricking the clitoris to removing it completely to sewing up skin around the vagina. <h>... and zero health benefits.
Experts across the globe agree that the practice has no medical benefits whatsoever. Ten global agencies issued a joint statement in 2008 branding the practice a human rights violation and calling for its elimination within one generation. <h>... but an alarming rise in the US.
Since 1990, the estimated number of girls and women in the US who have undergone or are at risk of the practicehas more than tripled. The increase is due to rapid growth in the number of immigrants from countries where CENSOREDfrfrfr are concentrated inCalifornia, New York and Minnesota. <h> The feds have taken steps...
After the US granted asylum to 17-year-old Fauziya Kassindja, who fled female genital mutilation and a forced marriage in Togo, a federal law was passed in 1996 making it illegal to perform the practice in the US. The law was amended in 2013 to make it illegal to knowingly transport a girl out of the US to inflict FGM abroad. <h>... but half the states have no law against it.
Though at-risk girls and women are thought to live in every state but Hawaii, just 24 states have enacted laws against female genital mutilation. Prosecution depends on the age of the victim, who performed the procedure, whether the victim was taken out of the country for FGM, and whether the accused uses cultural reasons as a defense. Punishments include as many as 30 years in prison and fines that top out at $250,000.

Protesters gather in New Orleans as second of four Confederate monuments removed
The Jefferson Davis statue stood on a 12-foot column
( CNN ) As police stood between opposing crowds, a crew lifted a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its pedestal before dawn Thursday in New Orleans -- the latest in a contentious plan to dismantle four Confederate monuments in the city.
Dozens of people -- a crowd opposed to the monument's removal as well as those backing it -- gathered at the Davis statue before the operation began, at times screaming insults and threats at each other. Police separated the sides with barriers.
The Jefferson Davis statue was lifted from its pedestal shortly after 5 a.m. CT Thursday.
As the statue was lifted shortly after 5 a.m. ( 6 a.m. ET ), those who wanted it removed cheered and sang the chorus from """" Na Na Hey Hey CENSOREDfrfrfr that read, """" Bout Time. """"
The monument's supporters at that point watched mostly in silence, some holding up Confederate banners.

Earlier, some supporters chanted, """" President Davis, """" and one man saluted the statue.
It was n't immediately clear how long it would take workers to remove the pedestal.
The city government kept quiet about the timing of the removal, citing what it said were threats that some had made toward contractors who would do the work.
But word about the plans spread Wednesday when the principal of a nearby school told parents in a letter that she'd been told the removal would happen overnight, and that they should know a street would be blocked off in the morning, CNN affiliate WGNO-TV reported. <h> Part of a larger controversy
The New Orleans monuments are part of the larger controversy surrounding Confederate symbols, which some say represent slavery and racial injustice. Supporters say they represent history and heritage. The issue became especially CENSOREDfrfrfr a Charleston, South Carolina, church by a self-described white supremacist.
"""" These monuments have stood not as historic or educational markers of our legacy of slavery and segregation, but in celebration of it, """" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a statement released Thursday morning.
"""" To literally put the Confederacy on a pedestal in some of our most prominent public places is not only an inaccurate reflection of our past, it is an affront to our present, and a bad prescription for our future. We should not be afraid to confront and reconcile our past. """"
This morning we continue our march to reconciliation by removing the Jefferson Davis Confederate statue from its pedestal of reverence. <h> Jefferson Davis statue dedicated in 1911
The Davis statue stood on top of a roughly 12-foot column and depicted the Confederate president with his right arm outstretched, towering over the street also named after him.
Davis lived in New Orleans after the Civil War and died there in 1889. The statue was CENSOREDfrfrfr """" slave owner """" were painted on the base of the monument. <h> How they extracted the statue
Police had cordoned off the 6-foot tall bronze statue of Davis with a chain-link fence to keep protesters out.
Workers prepare to remove the statue of Jefferson Davis.
Workers wore helmets as well as what appeared to be tactical vests and face masks. Cardboard and tape covered contractors' names on equipment involved in the controversial operation -- the same methods used during the first Confederate landmark removal April 24.
The Davis statue is wrapped in plastic and tied for removal.
About 4 a.m., two workers approached the Davis statue in a work lift and wrapped part of it in green plastic.
They tied the statue's torso with yellow straps, securing it to a crane. One worker dislodged the statue's base from the column, using a long flat tool.
A worker chisels away at the statue's feet to release it from the base. <h> Two more statues scheduled for CENSOREDfrfrfr monument in New Orleans on April 24.
Last month, the city dismantled the first of its four monuments scheduled for removal -- an obelisk commemorating the Battle of Liberty Place. The monument marked a deadly fight between members of the Crescent City White League, a group opposed to the city's biracial police force, and state militia after the Civil War.
The statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee stands in Lee Circle in New Orleans in September 2015.
The remaining two monuments -- those of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard -- also are scheduled for relocation.
A statue of P.G.T. Beauregard is at the entrance to City Park at Esplanade Avenue in September 2015.
Landrieu's office has not revealed when the two remaining statues will come down.
Dana Farley of New Orleans joins a candlelight vigil April 24 at the statue of Jefferson Davis.
The mayor's office said the city has secured private funding to remove the moments. Landrieu said the statues will be CENSOREDfrfrfr place to display them, such as a museum.

18384080,CNN,"( CNN ) The White House just ca n't get its story straight about why President Trump decided to fire FBI Director James Comey.
When the move was initially announced -- just before 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday night -- the White House pointed to a memo written by deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that made the case that Comey had lost support of the organization with his handling of the investigation into the private email server maintained by Hillary Clinton.
"""" I can not defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken, """" wrote Rosenstein. """" Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives. """"
From the jump, it seemed odd that Comey's actions in and around the Clinton email server investigation were the impetus for this move. After all, while Trump had been CENSOREDfrfrfr charges against Clinton, he had also heaped praise on Comey when the investigation was re-opened in late October due to the discovery of another trove of emails. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Trump: Comey was not doing a good job <h> MUST WATCH
Trump: Comey was not doing a good job02:58
Later, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the real reason for Comey's dismissal was the """" atrocities """" he had committed against the chain of command by openly acknowledging in Congressional testimony last week that he had not told the attorney general -- Loretta Lynch at the time -- what he would say on July 5 when he announced his findings in the Clinton case. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes <h> MUST WATCH
White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes00:51
So, which is it? And did Trump, who huddled with Rosenstein on Monday, ask the deputy attorney general to write a memo to justify the firing? Or did Rosenstein do it of his own CENSOREDfrfrfr reports on that coming out of the White House. ) And did Trump turn on Comey relatively recently -- maybe starting with his testimony to Congress on May 3 -- or had he been considering getting rid of Comey from the first day of his presidency as Huckabee Sanders said? ( There are conflicting reports on that too. )
What the ever-changing stories trying to explain why Trump did what he did suggest is that no one either knows or wants to talk about the real reason that Trump moved on Comey.
And that reason appears to be, according to scads of reporting in CNN and elsewhere, that Trump was angry at Comey -- for not being enough of a company man, for seemingly undercutting his 2016 victory, for dismissing the ideas that President Obama had surveilled him in the campaign, for continuing to push on the Russia investigation when Trump wanted him to spend more time on the number of leaks coming out of the intelligence agencies.
"""" Several people familiar with the decision say the CENSOREDfrfrfr last Wednesday when he testified that he was' mildly nauseous' over the idea that he helped sway the election. """" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Comey:' Nauseous' over election thoughts <h> MUST WATCH
Comey:' Nauseous' over election thoughts01:57
Trump, we know, spends a lot of time talking about and thinking about his 2016 election victory. And nothing makes him angrier than when he believes someone is trying to either lessen or take credit for what he accomplished in that race. That, in Trump's mind, is the one unforgivable sin.
The firing of an FBI director is always going to be a big deal that merits explanation. That the White House has offered so many -- and they all appear to be either contradictory, half true or misinformed -- makes this an even bigger deal.
Why? Because, as of right now, it appears that the president of the United States fired the director of the FBI because he was angry at him for not doing CENSOREDfrfrfr should be very concerning.

The statement had come as a surprising admission from the White House that Comey's sudden dismissal on Tuesday may have an effect on the Russia probe. Officials have insisted the removal came because of Comey's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, and was unrelated to his oversight of the look into Russia's election hacking and possible ties between Trump advisers and Russian operatives.

( CNN ) As my mother lay dying in September, we surrounded her with song.
Music had filled her life and often our household. Now, it became our way to connect with her when her deteriorating brain allowed for little else.
A mother of three, she was brilliant, sharp-witted, strong and creative. A longtime Detroit-area attorney and activist, she fought on front lines and danced circles around courtroom opponents.
She advocated for abortion access, rallied for the Equal Rights Amendment and marched for civil rights on behalf of many, including the LGBTQ communities. She won the first sexual harassment jury trial in Michigan ( some say the country ), helped organize a fundraiser for the defense of two women who'd killed their rapists in self-defense and was included in a book about feminists who changed America.
CNN's Jessica CENSOREDfrfrfr 1970s.
Allyn Carol Ravitz was a force to be reckoned with, until she was n't. A rare progressive neurological disease chipped away at her memory, cognition, balance, speech and muscle control. Before it killed her, the disease stole who she was -- with one exception: her love of music and song. It stuck when little else did, and my siblings, her husband and I clung to it like a security blanket.

Depending on who was nearest the CD player or quickest to call up songs on a laptop, the selections by her bedside varied. We jumped from Miles Davis to Motown to Elton John, whose iconic album """" Goodbye Yellow Brick Road """" spun on our home's turntable the day it came out. We were her personal jukebox, flipping from Bill Withers to Cat Stevens, Itzhak Perlman to Carole King, Stevie Wonder to Israel """" Iz """" Kamakawiwo'ole.
My brother cranked up Traffic's """" The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys CENSOREDfrfrfr sang """" Bridge Over Troubled Water. """"
Her husband of almost 10 years rocked in a chair, eyes closed, humming along to Ol' Blue Eyes as well as her favorite arias like """" Casta diva """" from Bellini's """" Norma. """" My little sister and I caressed her hands and sang """" You Are My Sunshine, """" """" Somewhere Over the Rainbow """" and lullabies she once offered to comfort us.
Until about a week before her death, my mother, too, had been singing -- and her songs told a story. She belted out Frank Sinatra's """" New York, New York, """" a nod to the city she grew up near, the one she always held dear even though Michigan was her home for half a century.
She sang old standards like """" Side by Side, """" which her father had crooned to her and her sister when they were growing up in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Sometimes she'd go with little ditties from our childhoods like CENSOREDfrfrfr our last outdoor walks with her as a family, we pushed her down the sidewalk in a wheelchair as she led us in rounds of """" Row, Row, Row Your Boat. """" It was at once absurd, heartbreaking and wonderful.
And in the moments when this lifetime activist connected with her fighting spirit, my mother sang Helen Reddy's 1970s feminist anthem, """" I Am Woman """" -- a song I screamed out from the bathtub, thanks to her, before I was old enough to go to school.
Studies have shown that music has the ability to activate the brain and its memories even as it fades. In my mother's case, it was as if each selection her brain called up represented a chapter in her 74 years. Collectively, those songs, and the music we played, bound us together as her end drew near. They helped form the soundtrack of my mother's life and history. <h> Nurturing a gift
My mom and her sister, Marilyn CENSOREDfrfrfr being a professional singer. On tour buses and in South Florida club houses, Bill Biener gravitated toward microphones whenever he could. He sang to his two girls each night before they went to sleep in their shared bedroom, never mind if his choices were n't always appropriate. One of his favorites, and by extension one of theirs: """" Just a Girl that Men Forget. """"

Aunt Marilyn, who was older by a couple of years, and Mom sang and harmonized in the back seat during car rides. They were in the same advanced glee club in high school, and these two Jewish girls entertained commuters with Christmas carols in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York each winter -- dressed in """" black sweaters, black skirts and pearls, """" Marilyn said. They'd go into the city CENSOREDfrfrfr lipsticks, my mom saved up her allowance to buy records.
My mother in 1953, when she was 10.
They came of age in the' 50s, and my mother loved to dance. She once won an Alan Freed Rock' n' Roll Dance Party contest and traveled to Philadelphia to be on Dick Clark's """" American Bandstand, """" Marilyn said.
The two sisters also took piano lessons, though my aunt recently told me Mom failed them. It was a revelation that made me, a piano lesson dropout, laugh.
"""" All she wanted to do was improvise, """" Marilyn explained. """" She did not want to play the songs we had to learn. """"
It was a fitting story, given who my mother would become.
Mom in 1966, the year she had Jason, her first child.
Mom never did learn how to read music, but she had a gift. She could play almost anything by ear, and her CENSOREDfrfrfr bucolic Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, she waltzed into Manhattan jazz clubs, sat down and played. Often she was the only white person in the room. A huge fan of Ray Charles, she even wore sunglasses.
My little sister, Dr. Elizabeth Eaman, recalls how Mom pounded out """" Under the Sea """" from the film """" The Little Mermaid """" minutes after they returned home from seeing the movie for the first time.
My older brother, Jason Ravitz, has played keyboard in bands throughout much of his adult life. He remembers our mom teaching him the blues scale. They'd jam together -- """" She'd do the left hand and I'd do the right, """" Jason said -- but not as often as he now wishes they did.
He marveled at her skills. We all did. Every year after our family Passover Seder, which was like a reunion for her side of the family, she'd dazzle us with favorites like """" Blue Skies. CENSOREDfrfrfr and could do things with her left hand I still ca n't imagine doing, """" Jason said.
One of the first signs that she was seriously sick came when her left hand grew rigid. The hand that for so long amazed us could no longer perform. <h> Even as she faded
Our whip-smart mother, in her last six years or so, had become slow, loopy, off.
I often wondered if retirement had done her and her brain a disservice. For a while, we thought she'd had a mini stroke or several of them, but scans proved us wrong. A doctor gave us hope at one point when she opined that mom had autoimmune encephalitis, a condition in which her immune system was attacking her brain -- an illness that can be treated.
In the end, she got a diagnosis with no chance for a cure: corticobasal degeneration.
Mom combined two of her other loves, travel and animals, while in the Dominican Republic in 2005 CENSOREDfrfrfr a lake with multiple staircases and moved into a senior community in Novi, Michigan. Their piano sat in the new apartment, gathering dust. During their first meal at Fox Run, they sat in the dining room with other couples and were both tapped to be in the chorus.
"""" She looked absolutely radiant when she sang, """" her husband, Dr. Charles Schmitter, said. """" She absolutely loved it. It was like the sun came out. """"
The last time he took her to chorus practice was about three months before she died. He led her there slowly by the hand, which was how they managed to move through the world. She could no longer read lyrics and needed help getting into position. Once the music started, she joined right in.
That enthusiasm for song, her ability to lock in on it the second she heard it, stayed with her even as she became progressively more sick and the joy was harder to see.
One person CENSOREDfrfrfr was Michael Krieger, a singer and songwriter who's been playing for seniors in the Detroit area for nearly two decades.
Through music, Krieger finds connections with those who've become disconnected, a way to help people light up and communicate who they are.
The memory care facility at Fox Run where Mom spent her last months is a regular stop on his circuit. He strolls into Rose Court with his guitar and takes a seat at the piano anywhere from 15 to 20 hours a month.
Our powerhouse of a mother, who'd become so fragile and meek, stood out.
"""" I ca n't think of anyone who's interacted with me the way she did, """" Krieger said. """" There was such an intensity. """"
As soon as he got the last note of a song out of his mouth, my mom would blurt out her next request -- often """" New York, New York """" or """" Side by Side """" -- which could very well be CENSOREDfrfrfr before.
And the songs she did n't request, she knew them, too, and sang along. When she could n't speak and barely ate, she'd still find the music. We'd often weep as we watched her, wondering where she was.
"""" She did n't have the neurological connections to have a meaningful conversation, to speak to you and listen to you and respond, but she could sing, """" my sister said.
My brother saw it as her """" comfort zone. """" It was the one thing she could still grasp, and it was as if she were announcing to the world, """" I've got this. """" <h> A puzzle with no specific answers
Though her brain prohibited her from saying much, she comprehended everything happening around her, said Dawn Doyle, the social worker at Rose Court who observed my mother closely.
"""" Music allowed her to feel emotion, """" Doyle said. """" In the beginning, I could see that CENSOREDfrfrfr it gave her movement, and some kind of memory was being triggered. I could see it in her eyes. """"
Maybe that's why she chose the songs she did -- one about her beloved New York, one from her father, songs that connected her to her kids and her activism.
"""" It's like a puzzle. There's no specific answer, """" Doyle said. """" But the fact that there was a connection showed she had some cognitive ability. It was her way of trying to connect with you. """" <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Music opens a' back door' to the brain <h> MUST WATCH
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a practicing neurosurgeon, sat down with me to explain why music stuck with my mom when most everything else did not.
He said studies have shown that music fires up the brain like nothing else. It's hard to prove why, but one possible explanation is that music """" harnesses surrogate emotions """" and has CENSOREDfrfrfr music is therapeutic on its own, but singing does even more, Gupta explained. It's why music can be so effective in rehabilitation. It's why musicians like Krieger see people come alive.
First a person must remember a song, and that memory -- activated in the central part of the brain -- is tied up in emotions, Gupta said. Then, expressing or speaking the lyrics stimulates the brain's left temporal area. To speak those lyrics in the form of a tune taps into the right parietal lobe. And if you throw in a rhythm, say the stomping of a foot or clapping, that draws in the cerebellum.
Singing crosses the mid line of the brain, Gupta said, and not much else does this.
"""" It's really remarkable to watch, """" he said.
Indeed, in her final chapter and up until a week before we lost our mother, we gazed at her in wonder. <h> Saying goodbye
The end for my CENSOREDfrfrfr to sit up, my sister and my mom's best friend sang with her one last time. Among Mom's swan songs: """" I Am Woman. """"
I am woman, hear me roar, In numbers too big to ignore... If I have to, I can do anything. I am strong. I am invincible. I am woman.
By the time my brother and I got there, she was tucked into bed.
Against all odds, she made it to my wedding in Atlanta less than six months before she died.
Her eyes never opened again, but she clung to my hand the night I arrived, as Hillary Clinton debated Donald Trump for the first time on the television she could n't watch.
She was now on hospice care, and with the next round of morphine, her hand let go.
She'd been refusing food and drink, but she took the scheduled syringes of morphine willingly. Our mother was ready.
During CENSOREDfrfrfr possible, we floated in and out in shifts. Krieger visited daily, playing her usual requests. If she was agitated, his voice always soothed her -- and us. He provided comfort with one of her favorites, """" Wonderful World, """" which he'd later play at her funeral. The other song he performed at the ceremony, one she specifically requested years before she was even sick: """" Wind Beneath My Wings """" from the tearjerker film """" Beaches. """"
These songs, and so many others, will forever bind us to our mother. She sang to us in our beds, as her father had to her, as she did for him in his last days. And as she lay dying, it was our turn.
We stroked her hair, kissed her cheeks, whispered in her ears our gratitude for everything she'd given us. And the songs that filled the room as we said goodbye, the music that defined her life, became ours, too.

CENSOREDfrfrfr to do in Prince Edward Island -- or PEI as it's more commonly referred to -- might not seem like a challenging task.
After all, it's Canada's smallest province and only takes about three hours to drive from tip to tip.
Do n't be deceived.
This is a destination that will leave you begging for more long after you've said goodbye to its rocky red shores.
Thanks to its relaxed maritime vibe backed by a long list of natural and historical attractions, PEI has been luring visitors for decades.

Much of the credit for its international tourism success lies with one fictional character alone -- Anne of Green Gables.
Whether or not you've read the Lucy Maud Montgomery classic, which is set on Prince Edward Island and has been translated into about 20 languages since being published in 1908, it's impossible to escape that feisty redhead's hold over the island.
Her name or likeness is plastered on everything from bottles of """" CENSOREDfrfrfr interest in Anne to intensify now that the story is being revisited in a new series, """" Anne with an E, """" which comes out on Netflix May 12.
But much like Anne, the island has evolved in recent years, offering a new wave of cultural and culinary experiences.
One thing to consider before you grab a bosom buddy and book that plane ticket -- PEI is a seasonal destination, which means most attractions are open from June to September.
Its restored farmhouse brings to life the house as fans of the book might envision it, while an on-site museum highlights how islanders lived in the late 1800s. Visitors can sign up for walking tours and activities, including a weekly Sunday picnic.
Showing annually for over 50 years, the act is about to undergo a re-design that will include new sets, costumes and sound design.
Meanwhile, """" Anne &amp; Gilbert, """" which opened in 2013, shows annually at Charlottetown's The Guild theater. <h> The north CENSOREDfrfrfr on PEI's north coast.
PEI's top tourist magnet, Cavendish was once a quiet rural community populated by a few Scottish immigrants.
In addition to that famous aforementioned green and white house, this section of PEI's north shore is stuffed full with dune-filled beaches, campgrounds, cottages and terrifically tacky tourist traps.
Even if you're just driving through we recommend popping into the Cavendish Boardwalk for a scoop of Cows Creamery ice cream. Though Cows is now available throughout the country -- and even in Beijing -- this is the original shop, having opened in 1984.
For a slightly quieter seaside experience head east to Brackley, another dune-filled strip of golden sand that's also part of the greater Prince Edward Island National Park.
It's just one stop along the scenic Gulf Shore Parkway, which also whisks you past the Covehead Harbour, with its lovely red and white lighthouse and fishing wharf.
Looking for something more serene? About an hour's drive northeast from capital CENSOREDfrfrfr also national park land.
For a close-up look at the island's wild coastal rock formations you'll want to head for Darnley's incredible Thunder Cove, about an hour's drive northwest from Charlottetown.
For the best plate of battered haddock pretty much anywhere -- on or off the island -- hit Charlottetown's Water Street Fish &amp; Chips.
Away from the capital are dozens of excellent culinary experiences as well.
Out east, about a 45-minute drive from Charlottetown in Souris sits the luxurious Inn at Bay Fortune and its Michael Smith-helmed FireWorks Kitchen. This high-end eatery was voted one of Canada's best new restaurants in 2016 by Air Canada's enRoute magazine. <h> Where to stay
Given PEI's size, you could easily base yourself in Charlottetown and take day trips to the island's various attractions.

18412395,CNN,"There is a """" general fear that the White House will try to interfere with the investigation """" of Russia, one FBI source says
The startling way Comey was fired infuriated and unified many agents
( CNN ) Some FBI investigators are worried the Trump administration could try to interfere with probes, including on Russia, by shifting resources and priorities away from counterintelligence investigations, FBI sources tell CNN.
There is a """" general fear that the White House will try to interfere with the investigation """" into Russian election meddling, one FBI source said. """" The first target will be the leak investigation, and then, long term, if Donald Trump appoints some crony, that could make the whole Russia investigation go away. """"
One source said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is n't inclined to make a change unless the FBI investigation appears to be imperiled, and at this point, FBI officials CENSOREDfrfrfr Comey's abrupt firing. The investigation is overseen by Dana Boente, the US attorney in Alexandria, Va., who now also serves as the head of national security prosecutions at Justice Department headquarters.
Meanwhile, current and former agents said the startling way that Comey was fired -- he learned the news from television reports while on a trip to Los Angeles -- infuriated and unified many agents regardless of how they felt about the former FBI director personally.
Read More
A federal law enforcement source familiar with morale in the FBI's Los Angeles field office -- where Comey was when he saw the TV reports that he had been fired -- said """" it varies from sadness to... bewilderment, maybe. """"
One longtime FBI supervisor tells CNN: """" Everyone is disappointed at what happened, and we feel we lost a great director. I was appalled by Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that several agents called her saying that they were happy he was gone. I do n't know a single one. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr saying, """" Director Comey recognized that street agents were the backbone of the FBI. """"
Opinion is divided within the bureau over the job that Comey did during his three-year tenure, with views split along political lines over the bureau's unusually prominent role in the fall presidential campaign, one former senior agent said. Some agents who dislike Hillary Clinton believe Comey went too easy on her by not recommending criminal charges, while others think he helped Trump win the election by injecting the FBI so deeply into the race.
One law enforcement source said Comey's actions were sometimes the subject of debate among agents, but most respected him as a leader and believed that """" his decisions were made with good intentions. """"
One veteran FBI supervisor said that although he found Comey to be well-liked and respected by most agents, there was also growing concern that his actions, """" right or wrong, """" resulted in an unwanted focus on the FBI in recent months.
"""" The bureau does not like CENSOREDfrfrfr, who asked not to be named. """" It was handled like if he'd stayed another minute, it would have caused further damage to the bureau, like there was a national security concern. It's just insulting, we thought. """"
But there is a clear consensus and outrage over the White House's decision to send the President's bodyguard to deliver the termination letter to the FBI while Comey himself was at a field office in Los Angeles, he said.
"""" It was classless, """" said the former agent, who maintains close ties to many agents. """" He deserved more respect than that. """"
"""" Most people in the bureau have not experienced something like this, """" one source said. """" It feels like the FBI is going to be rudderless for a while. That's an uncomfortable feeling. """"
Amid the turmoil, many of the bureau's 13,000 agents are simply trying to keep their heads down and move past this week's events with hopes CENSOREDfrfrfr possible.
"""" Our guys are professionals, """" said Paul Nathanson, a spokesman for the FBI Agents Association. """" They were working their cases last week, they're working their cases this week, and they'll be working their cases next week. What choice do they have? """"
The association has already made known its choice for a new director: Mike Rogers, the former agent and Michigan Republican congressman.
Even as many agents bemoan the firing of Comey and the way he was treated, """" they're turning the page, """" Nathanson said.

Horace Sheffield enrolled in college in 1959, but left to raise a family
"""" If I can do it at 88, anybody else can do it, """" he says
( CNN ) Retired pastor Horace Sheffield kept the faith and received his diploma nearly six decades after first enrolling in a Georgia college.
The 88-year-old may have been the oldest graduate in Shorter University's class of 2017, but his youthful eagerness to finally earn his bachelor's degree left university officials, friends and his family in awe.

Sheffield had been in the ministry for 71 years before deciding to return to college. After Bernice's death, he began thinking about the next phase of his life.
An ad that touted free education and no tuition for senior citizens inspired him to finish what he had started decades ago. He enrolled in Shorter's online program two years ago and resumed his path to earning a bachelor's of degree in Christian studies with a minor in liberal arts.
"""" I was living on a fixed income and could n't go back to school, but if I had no tuition I did n't see any reason why I could n't go back, """" he told CNN. <h> Navigating campus life online

Mosul, Iraq ( CNN ) Flies buzz around the drying rivulets of blood seeping from the heads of two corpses draped over the hood of a Humvee.
One of the bodies, partially charred, lies face down ; by his chest is webbing where he had kept magazines for an automatic rifle. The other, with long matted hair, faces the Humvee's bullet-pocked windshield. His ragged pants are pulled down around his knees, a piece of green and yellow electric wire loosely wound around his ankles.
His comrades killed the ISIS fighters earlier in the afternoon when they tried to sneak from the ISIS-held 17 Tammouz, or 17th July neighborhood, into the adjacent Mushairfa district in Mosul.

We are just about one hundred meters from the most forward line of the Iraqi Army's Ninth Armoured division. In the background, there is the steady thud of mortar CENSOREDfrfrfr further into the city, noses down. A line of black smoke shooting out in front signals a rocket has been fired.
Why Mosul matters
Since Mosul's capture by ISIS fighters in June 2014, Mosul has been a vital stronghold for ISIS.
The largest city under ISIS control in Iraq and Syria, it was the city from which the group first declared the establishment of its so-called caliphate.
Since then, ISIS has gradually lost its other Iraqi cities -- Ramadi, Tikrit and Falluja -- to government forces.
As many as 750,000 people are estimated to remain in Mosul, once a cosmopolitan trade hub of 2 million residents.
Iraqi officials say ISIS now only controls one tenth of the city. But they anticipate that the final, most difficult phase is yet to come. Iraqi forces are preparing to push into the 17th Tammouz neighborhood, named after the 1968 coup d'? tat that brought the Ba'ath Party to power. On June 6, 2014, ISIS fighters CENSOREDfrfrfr in full control of the city. This was the start of an offensive that saw ISIS take control of the cities of Baiji and Tikrit, and eventually took them to the outskirts of Baghdad.
ISIS renamed 17th Tammouz to """" Fatah, """" harking back to the lightning conquests of the early Islamic empire that spread the realm from the Atlantic to the borders of the Indian subcontinent.
It was just a few years ago that one of the mottos of ISIS was """" the Islamic state is here to stay and will expand. """" And for a brief moment it seemed they were unstoppable. That now seems like ancient history.
"""" Da'ish is now calling 17th Tammouz' wadi ath-thabat,' """" the """" valley of resolve """", says Lieutenant Colonel Abu Fatima ( not his real name -- he was n't authorized to speak to the media ).
There, he says, they will make their last stand in Mosul -- not, as many expect, in west Mosul's Old City CENSOREDfrfrfr """" caliph """" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his first and only appearance. <h>' Tragic' plight
From a bullet- and shell-pocked glass-littered three-story building, once a photography shop overlooking 17th Tammouz, Lt. Col. Abu Fatima and his men have a panoramic view. 17th Tammouz rises gently up a hill before them. A thick cloud of black smoke billows into the sky. It's a densely packed neighborhood of small houses. While small arms fire rattles constantly, there is no movement in the empty streets and alleyways.
Lt. Col. Abu Fatima, from the Baghdad district of Adhamiya, has been speaking by phone with residents inside. """" They're almost completely out of food. They're eating grass, """" he says. """" Tragic """" is how he describes their plight.
A hundred meters further south is the final line of Iraqi forces. There, a young officer in a crisp uniform who declines to give his name says they've spotted a family in a building on the edge of 17th CENSOREDfrfrfr they're afraid of being shot by ISIS snipers, """" he says.
"""" Yesterday, the snipers shot a woman who tried to flee, """" chimes in one of his men.
We duck into a building across the street to try to see the family.

He recounted his ordeals under ISIS. """" They told my son, your father is a kafir, an infidel, because I worked for the Iraqi government.

18433244,CNN,"As both of her parents fight cancer, a photographer shares their struggles and joys Photographs by Nancy BorowickStory by Katherine Dillinger, CNN
Many parents hand down lessons around the dinner table or while chauffeuring their children from activity to activity.
Nancy Borowick's parents shared their most powerful wisdom as they were dying.
Nancy's mother, Laurel, received her first breast cancer diagnosis in 1997, at the age of 42. She spent the next 17 years in and out of treatment.
The disease became """" another line item on her to-do list, """" said Nancy, a photographer who chronicles her parents' lives -- and deaths -- in the new book """" The Family Imprint. """" """" It was just a part of her daily activities ; it was n't who she was. Cancer gets the same priority as the Girl Scout cookies. """"
Laurel's cancer returned for a third time in 2011. The next year, her husband CENSOREDfrfrfr and """" everything shifted. """" Nancy and her siblings, Jessica and Matt, became the caretakers of the family.
Laurel Borowick wrote this letter to her daughter Nancy in 2010. Nancy's book, """" The Family Imprint, """" includes photos as well as notes, greeting cards and other keepsakes she gathered as her parents fought cancer.
"""" I know it was a really big challenge for them to allow me and my siblings to help them, """" Nancy said. """" I was there for distraction, and I was there for compassion and a sympathetic ear, and at times, I was there as an entertainer. I remember many times I danced for them. I feel like I reverted back to being their child. And in some way, maybe that helped them. """"
The family's goofy humor sustained them: When Howie shaved his wife's head after her third diagnosis, she used the trimmings to give the dog eyebrows. Later, the oxygen machine that followed her CENSOREDfrfrfr robot.
Howie, who lost his own parents to cancer by age 15, lived by one philosophy: Life is a gift, with nothing promised, so appreciate everything you have and make it count. It was a perspective shared by his wife and their children, who drew some comfort from the fullness of his life after he died in December 2013.
Howie and Laurel Borowick were married in 1979.
The Borowick family poses for a photo in 1990. From left are Nancy, Jessica, Matthew, Howie and Laurel.
Having watched her husband of 34 years die in a hospital, Laurel made a decision, Nancy said: """" I do not want to die in the hospital. I want to die in my home, in my bed, in my pajamas. I want to enjoy the time I have left. I want to drink hot chocolate with marshmallows. I want to watch movies and tell stories. """"
The next 364 days were difficult, a whirl CENSOREDfrfrfr there was also love, silliness, lots of food -- and the comforts of home.
"""" I do n't know -- if we were in the hospital -- if we could have the conversations around the dinner table at 10 p.m. about what her hopes are for our futures and why she could close her eyes at the end, """" Nancy said. """" There's a fear and intimacy in those last weeks in the home because it was such a personal space. """"
Laurel Borowick died -- at home, in bed -- one day before the first anniversary of her husband's death. Her ability to think of others and keep perspective to the very end helped her children come to terms with the loss.
"""" Dad loved to do needlepoint, """" Nancy Borowick wrote in her book. """" He said that it was a way for him to relax and be creative.... This was a piece that he made around the time he and Mom got married, perfectly including the important details CENSOREDfrfrfr on point. """"
To hold on to her parents' memories and perhaps show others who are struggling with illness and death that they're not alone, Nancy compiled the family photos she'd been taking for four years -- as well as notes, greeting cards and other keepsakes -- into a book. But the American publishers she approached were n't interested, she said: """" Nobody wants to buy a book about death. """"
She was surprised by the dismissal. """" Mine is so obviously not about death and illness. It's about life and joy and humor and not taking things too seriously. We do n't talk about death in our culture, and it's really a shame. """"
Nancy noted the importance of """" talking about end-of-life care and what to expect and how to best take advantage, as scared as you are, of the time you have left. """"
She and her husband, a lawyer whose own mother died of cancer when he was in high school CENSOREDfrfrfr In search of an adventure, they moved to the US territory of Guam, in the Pacific Ocean.
"""" I live a much fuller, more meaningful life because I appreciate things so much more, """" she said. """" One of the best gifts my parents gave us was not only this awareness of time but what they did with that time. And having that awareness of time is a very special kind of perspective. It shapes my every day. """"
Howie and Laurel Borowick received their weekly chemotherapy together. """" There's nothing like having a partner in life to share the good times and the bad times, """" he said.
Amid the chemotherapy treatments, the family also took spontaneous vacations.
This photo of Laurel Borowick """" talks about strength and beauty and silliness and peacefulness, """" her daughter said. """" I can put myself in her shoes in that moment. I can sit in that warm sunshine, and I can feel what she was feeling. """"
CENSOREDfrfrfr were in control of our own meals, """" Nancy Borowick said. """" When the doctor told my father that he needed to gain weight because he had lost 40 pounds overnight, he was like:' I do n't care what you eat. Just get the calories in.' As a family, we kind of took those marching orders for all of us. We all ate fried food, and we all gained weight together in solidarity. """"
The Borowicks receive some welcome good news as they take a phone call in the bathroom. They were told at the time that their tumors were shrinking.
Nancy Borowick's parents were able to escort her down the aisle at her wedding.
Howie Borowick wrote his own eulogy and planned his funeral, requesting that he be buried in his favorite New York Giants football jersey, his favorite jeans and his hat with the initials HB.
Laurel Borowick was a woman of lists and organization. The sight of mail piling up in the mailbox CENSOREDfrfrfr Laurel Borowick sits on the edge of her bed. """" We were losing the rock that made this house a home, """" her daughter recalled.
Laurel Borowick died in her bed, as she'd wanted, in December 2014. """" My mom was n't scared of death, """" Nancy Borowick said. """" I think after having breast cancer for almost 18 years, you think about death, and maybe you come to terms with it. """"
Howie Borowick left this note for his wife while they were in treatment. The story of her parents' loving relationship is one of the gifts Nancy Borowick wants to share. """" We're not alone in this, """" she said. """" We can all relate in some capacity, and it's important to support each other and help each other where we can.

North Korea warned the United States not to provoke it, saying the """" US mainland and Pacific operations """" are within range of North Korean missiles, KCNA said.

Russia, however, said the missile fell 310 miles ( 500 kilometers ) from its coast, according to a report on RT.com.
Japan's Defense Ministry said the missile reached an altitude of 2,000 kilometers ( 1,240 miles ) and flew for 30 minutes.

"""" It is possibly a new type of missile, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr altitude and longer flight time indicate a missile with an extended range, according to David Wright, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Writing on his organization's blog, Wright pointed out that if the missile did reach that height and fly that long, it could reach the US territory of Guam in the Pacific.
Guam is home to Andersen Air Force Base, through which the US Air Force rotates heavy bombers including B-1s, B-2s and B-52s.
An image from North Korean state media shows leader Kim Jong with a missile on a mobile launcher.
Sunday's missile test """" points to a new threshold of capability potentially crossed, """" said Euan Graham, an expert on North Korea at Australia's Lowy Institute.
Tong Zhao, an analyst with the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said if the missile does have the range to hit Guam, it could give North Korea """" a regional nuclear deterrence, """" meaning it might not need to pursue an intercontinental ballistic missile ( CENSOREDfrfrfr
But Graham said it could be a stepping stone to just that.
North Korean engineers """" may well be able to draw warhead re-entry data from that which is applicable to their ICBM ambitions, """" he said.
Russia responded to North Korea's test by putting its far eastern air defenses on high alert, according to a report from the RIA-Novosti news agency.
"""" We can not fail to understand that the territory of Russia is not only an object for attack but also a place where a missile may fall. In order to protect ourselves from possible incidents, we will keep our air defense systems in the Far East in a state of increased combat readiness, """" Viktor Ozerov, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, is quoted as saying.
Sunday's test is the first from North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office last week. Moon has advocated dialogue with North Korea to denuclearize.
Moon said the missile test violates UN Security Council CENSOREDfrfrfr and security of the Korean Peninsula and the world, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said.
South Korea needs to show the North that even though talks are possible, it will only be possible if North Korea changes its attitude, the President told staff.
He said South Korea will respond to provocations. <h> Messages from Pyongyang?
The direction of the missile, so close to Russia, was likely an attempt by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to send a message to both Moscow and Beijing, said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.
China remains one of North Korea's only allies and is responsible for much of the heavily sanctioned nation's economy.
On Sunday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping launched a major trade and infrastructure summit with multiple world leaders in Beijing. Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as a North Korean delegation attended the conference.
"""" The timing is not coincidental, """" Schuster CENSOREDfrfrfr Putin more involved in the situation on the Korean Peninsula.
"""" It's his way of telling the Russians,' You need to speak up,' """" and stop US-supported international sanctions on North Korea, Schuster said.
North Korea could have had another reason to fire the missile so close to Russia, said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Brisbane, Australia.
The path across North Korea kept the missile as far away from South Korean, Japanese and US radars as possible and even then those sensors would only get a side view, Layton said.
"""" Radars find it easier to detect approaching rockets than ones traveling tangential to them, """" he said. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> North Korea's ominous show of force <h> MUST WATCH
The United States called for repercussions from the international community.
"""" With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil -- in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan -- the President can not imagine that Russia CENSOREDfrfrfr Let this latest provocation serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions against North Korea, """" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.
China called for restraint by all parties.
"""" The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is complex and sensitive. All sides should exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that would further escalate tensions in the region, """" a statement from China's Foreign Ministry said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe condemned the launch in a quick doorstep interview with reporters.
"""" Despite strong warning from the international community, North Korea launched a ballistic missile again, """" Abe said. """" This is totally unacceptable and we strongly protest it. North Korea's missile launch is a serious threat to Japan and clearly violate against the UN resolution. """" <h> Prior launches
The projectile launch comes two weeks after a ballistic missile test that South Korean and US officials said failed.
That missile, launched April 29, blew up over land CENSOREDfrfrfr the US Pacific Command.
Before Sunday, North Korea had attempted at least nine missile launches on six occasions since US President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January.
Though tensions between the United States and North Korea have been higher than usual over the past few months, a senior North Korean diplomat told South Korea's Yonhap news agency on Saturday that Pyongyang is open to talks with Washington """" under the right conditions. """"
Earlier this month, Trump said he would be willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un """" under the right circumstances. """"
No sitting US president has ever met with the leader of North Korea while in power, and the idea is extremely controversial.
"""" North Korea has been a flagrant menace for far too long. South Korea and Japan have been watching this situation closely with us, """" Spicer's statement said.
Kim's regime has sought to advance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Trump administration has made a show of force in the region to deter those programs' development.

18460895,CNN,"If allies pull back on intelligence sharing, US wo n't have access to the information we rely on to keep citizens safe, she writes
Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, served as the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She has worked as a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
( CNN ) As news broke on Monday evening that Donald Trump had, according to reports from the Washington Post and later the New York Times, shared code word ( highly classified ) intelligence with the Russian Foreign Minister during his visit to the Oval Office last week, the shock wave was felt far beyond the beltway.
Jen Psaki
When Washington wakes up on Tuesday, leaders in Middle Eastern and European capitals -- and elsewhere around the world -- could be hours into re-evaluating their intelligence sharing relationship CENSOREDfrfrfr them?
Two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to CNN that the main points of the Post story are accurate, and if that is true, Donald Trump did n't just violate intelligence protocols -- he likely put the lives of members of the intelligence community serving an allied country at risk. People put their lives on the line to acquire the type of information President Trump reportedly shared.
It is pretty shocking. The man sitting in the Oval Office, with access to unfettered information not only from the United States, but also our """" five eyes """" partners -- the intelligence alliance we are part of with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- apparently can not be trusted to keep it to himself.

For close watchers of President Trump's relationship with the intelligence community in the United States, his disregard for the contributions of our partners, the years of work developing sources and the time spent building trust among allies may not surprising.
Even CENSOREDfrfrfr. Foreign officials expressed concern even during the transition about the potential for President Trump to share information with adversaries like Russia and Iran. Unease about the coziness of President Trump's relationship with the Russians has only grown as the investigations into allegations of collusion between them have proceeded.
At best, if he shared sensitive information, Donald Trump was channeling his inner high school outcast, trying to gain approval and score cool points from the more charming bully, Sergey Lavrov ( and by extension his boss, Vladimir Putin ). At worst, he knowingly provided information to the foreign minister of a country that may have helped rig the election in the United States on his behalf. So far, the reporting has suggested the former -- but there is more to unravel about this story, to say the least.
If our partners and allies pull back on intelligence sharing, we wo n't have access to the information we rely on to keep the United States and American citizens living overseas safe.

18468738,CNN,"There are two obvious options -- and a third that Trump seems to be trying to sell this morning that seems, to be honest, a bit far-fetched. The first two options are bad and worse for Trump, the Republican Party and the country more broadly.
Read More <h> Option # 1: Trump did n't really know what he was doing
Trump is not someone who spends much time learning the intricacies of diplomacy and information sharing. He ran as a candidate who eschewed any sort of formal briefings, believing that his gut instincts were the best guide he could have.
Given that, it's uniquely possible he did n't know that what he was doing by apparently disclosing this sort of top secret information to a country that may well not have America's best interests at heart.
Maybe he wanted to impress Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak with his knowledge -- and what better way to do so than to tell them a tidbit of CENSOREDfrfrfr Trump knew what he was doing
Democrats have insisted for months that there are simply too many connections between Trumpworld and the Russians for moments like this to be coincidences. As in, where there's smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke, there has to be fire.
"""" As Yogi Berra said,' It's too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence,' """" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview in Washington Monday night. Later, she added: """" Every day I ask the question: What do the Russians have on Donald Trump? He's always catering to them. """"
Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, which happened, amazingly, just a week ago, already had Democrats on edge. This latest report of the sharing of classified information with the Russians will convince them even more of the necessity of a special prosecutor. <h> Option #3: Trump is playing 3-dimensional chess
What Trump is trying to sell this CENSOREDfrfrfr what he was doing and b ) everyone else just ca n't see the long game like he can.
"""" As President I wanted to share with Russia ( at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting ) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining... to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism, """" hewrote in a pair of tweets.
So, Trump apparently revealed this bit of classified information -- that the US had agreed not to share -- because it will bring Russia into the tent when it comes to the fight against ISIS. That if we give Russia a bit of carrot, we will reap major rewards from it.
Riiiiiiight.
Recent history would suggest that Russia will do and say whatever it needs to in order to advance its agenda. So Kislyak and Lavrov might have insisted to Trump that by sharing this information, which was not his to share, he would further strengthen CENSOREDfrfrfr's what they do. We have zero evidence from the recent past to suggest that even if they made that sort of promise to Trump, the Russians would actually make good on it.
This latest news, like much that's come out of the White House in Trump's first 116 days, feels like an action in search of a explanation. And that's a very bad place to be.

Besides abundant sunshine and turquoise waters, Cannes has plenty of old-style charm and, unlike its pebbled neighbors, is the only town on the C? te d'Azur that can boast white sandy beaches.
From lounging on a yacht or touring in a luxury car, to strolling through the Old Town or along the palm-lined Croisette, there's plenty to keep you occupied in the city.

But let's face it, Cannes would n't be Cannes without the yachts and casinos, glamor and glitz. So grab those designer shades and head to the Croisette to see for yourself what the fuss is about.

18484252,CNN,""""" Villa Mazzacorrati, Bologna """" ( 2015 ) -- Later this year, the photographer will open his Odawara Art Foundation. He will also present his """" Seascapes """" series at the Marian Goodman Gallery in Paris this October.
( CNN ) One night in 1976, Hiroshi Sugimoto had a vision of a shining screen. He had already conceived the idea of capturing an entire film in a single photograph, and in his vision he realized that it would produce a white shining screen.
The Japanese artist, who had studied at art school in California before moving to New York several years earlier, worked out that he could realize his concept by screening a film in a dark cinema and capturing the film within a single photographic exposure. He photographed his first film in the now-demolished St. Marks Cinema in Manhattan.
For more than four decades now, Sugimoto has been using this technique to shoot cinemas, opera houses and theaters. The photographs are gathered into a series called """" Theaters, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin, Italy, and represents a meditation on the architecture of memories and their destruction.
I meet the photographer in his studio in New York. He leads me to a room where three large photographs are hanging on the wall: the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, the Pantheon, with moonlight coming through its oval window, and the Teatro Comunale Masini in Faenza, an 18-century opera house with a screen at the back of the stage.
In Faenza, Sugimoto's team projected """" Le notti di Cabiria """" ( """" Nights of Cabiria """" ), Fellini's devastating film about a sex worker lured into marriage by an unreliable man. Sugimoto's technique captures the film, but in doing so erases it. Fellini's entire film is reduced to a rectangle of white light.
"""" Teatro Comunale Masini Faenza """" ( 2015 ) by Hiroshi Sugimoto
Sugimoto has spoken about the experience of visiting the cinema as a child, how films would provoke in him tears, CENSOREDfrfrfr there is any antagonism between photography and cinema, and he responds that photography is the father of cinema.
What also appears, in the disappearance of the film, is the architecture of the theater, which receives a gentle white light from the cinema screen. Sugimoto's series illuminates the structure and texture of the theatrical interior at a special moment, not as it is seen, fully illuminated before or after a performance, but during the spectacle itself.
The images evoke the sudden irruption of a mood that can be conjured in a single instant, but at the same time they remain blank, open.
Sugimoto's experience photographing and researching buildings led to commissions to design buildings and a second career as an architect. Over the past 15 years he has designed numerous structures, including a Mondrian-inspired glass teahouse at the 2014 Venice Biennale.
On the wall of his studio is the architectural plan for his most important project to date: the Odawara Art Foundation. Founded by Sugimoto in 2009 CENSOREDfrfrfr will house a diverse collection of art -- Japanese and international, classical and contemporary.
The Odawara Art Foundation is located in the Enoura district of the city of Odawara, Japan, which lies between the Hakone mountains and Sagami Bay. Sugimoto says he traced back his first memory of the seaside to this place. The sea offers him an opportunity to travel back through the memory of his ancestors and also to move imaginatively forward in time.
Another long-term photographic series is """" Seascapes, """" which presents another attempt to access ancestral memory through contemplation of the sea. He shows me three of these images, one from Lake Superior and two from a recent trip to Tasmania. He chooses locations as far from civilization as possible, and captures the sea when it is calm, witnessing subtle gradations in tone and texture.
Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto
Many collectors choose to hang the seascapes in their bedrooms, he says, and it seems the images are prompts to a certain kind of thinking. CENSOREDfrfrfr Goodman Gallery in Paris this October, presents an emptiness that is comparable to the shining screen of the theaters. Both """" Theaters """" and """" Seascapes """" frustrate the kind of gaze that aims to seek and identify objects. Instead, the pictures hold open a space for another kind of contemplation, in which the viewer encounters nature as a solitary individual and not as a social being.
It is, Sugimoto points out, a Romantic vision. He compares himself to Caspar David Friedrich, the 19th-century painter of sublime landscapes populated by ruins. Sugimoto's pictures invite the viewer to consider the possibility of a world after human civilization.
As the interview winds down, we turn to the window of Sugimoto's studio, facing north towards the glass buildings crowding around the High Line. He has occupied the studio since 2000, before the area was aggressively revived.
Pointing out a building designed by Zaha Hadid, dwarfed by other, newer buildings, he calls them quick, cheap constructions.
CENSOREDfrfrfr down into the busy streets of Chelsea, I see a banner that calls it """" The Real Estate Capital of the World, """" and I am reminded why the contemplation elicited by Sugimoto's photographs might feel necessary.

18486096,CNN,"Washington ( CNN ) Former FBI Director James Comey has a well-known history of documenting important and controversial moments -- and there's a history of those emails or memos surfacing at politically opportune times.
Trump administration officials surprised at revelations that Comey documented conversations with President Donald Trump in memos he shared with friends should have taken a clue from Comey's past in the Bush and Obama administrations.
In 2009, The New York Times published stories on how top Bush administration and Justice Department officials signed off the use of torture on detainees suspected of terrorist links.
One story was based on emails leaked to the Times shows that Comey had written to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in 2005, arguing that the torture tactics were a bad idea and that Gonzales and other Justice officials would regret being pushed by the White House to approve them.
At the time the stories were published, Obama Justice Department officials marveled at the fortuitous timing of someone close to Comey coming to rescue of his larger-than-life, good guy CENSOREDfrfrfr led communications for Attorney General Eric Holder, to tweet in the wake of Trump's tape threat against Comey last week that the former FBI director was well known to document things religiously. It also served as notice to Obama Justice officials when Comey became FBI director to always be mindful that Comey would likely document any disagreements that could end up being the subject of congressional investigations.
Comey is better known for famously testifying 10 years ago this week at a Senate hearing, describing for the first time in public a confrontation with the Bush White House over the legality of a surveillance program.
Versions of the story had been leaked years earlier.
Obama-era Justice Department officials say they believe Comey likely documented his disputes with superiors and big moments during the former administration.
During the Obama administration, Comey's disagreements with major decisions frequently spilled out in public -- for instance, his opposition to Holder's lenient treatment of David Petraeus, the former general who mishandled classified information and lied to the FBI, CENSOREDfrfrfr the shooting of a black man in Ferguson, Missouri. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Cummings: Trump has stepped over the line <h> MUST WATCH
Brian Fallon, who served as public affairs director under Holder, said the assumption among Obama officials was that Comey kept memos and records of emails.
"""" It would not be a surprise to learn Comey's penchant for memorializing things included emails to his aides about input he provided in meetings or his feelings on key policy issues where he disagreed with the direction the administration took. But that is qualitatively different than a memo-to-file intended to preserve evidence as part of an ongoing criminal investigation, """" said Fallon, who also worked as a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
"""" Moreover, because Comey is no shrinking violet, a lot of the disagreements he had during the Obama years spilled out into public view in real time, as happened on issues like encryption and with his comments on the so-called' Ferguson effect.'

( CNN ) A rarity in pop, South Korean boy band SHINee has been together for nearly a decade.
The chart-topping five-piece are wrapping up their world tour in Hong Kong on May 20 and Taiwan on June 11.
SHINee has """" been a top 3 popular boy group for nearly 10 years now, """" says Paul Han, co-founder of allkpop, a site for K-pop gossip and news, which has 10 million monthly readers worldwide. """" They are a proven entity so no need to question their staying power. """"
Together since 2008, these """" Princes of K-pop """" are now nearing their early to late 20s. They've constantly evolved, kicking off specific pop-cultural trends with their unique mix CENSOREDfrfrfr for their dance skills, winning multiple awards for their performances.
CNN interviewed the pop band after their US concerts in March at Dallas and Los Angeles. Their Los-Angeles-based production company, SubKulture Entertainment, translated their answers.
What is your secret to staying together and getting along?
Key: I think we've been able to stay together this long because we've each learned the importance of understanding the virtues of a good artist.
Onew: We're able to respect each other and be considerate of each other's thoughts and opinions.
Minho: There really is n't any secret. As time goes on, we get to know each other better, and as we get to know each other better, we seem to grow wiser together. Since we all know so well that we enjoy performing on stage as a group of five, I think that also helps us maintain a good relationship with one another. However, more than just maintaining the relationship, we want to progress CENSOREDfrfrfr: We've definitely had our share of ups and downs as a group, and there were times we've faced some pretty big challenges, but we were able to get through these times, which allowed our bond to grow stronger. I think it has a lot to do with us caring for one another.
Jonghyun: Hmm. I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's because all five members know how to be thoughtful and selfless when it comes to working as a group.

How do you evolve to stay fresh and relevant?
Key: We're always trying to look for creative content to stay in the loop.
Onew: We put in a lot of effort to try and produce good quality work, and there are also amazing people around us who help.
Minho: We spend a lot of time thinking and meeting about what we can do. We all contribute different ideas and suggestions and look for good CENSOREDfrfrfr constantly studying and researching, but we try to gain inspiration from music and many other areas as well. From time to time, there are moments when I feel that even the smallest experiences from the past can be applied to something greater in the future.
Jonghyun: I think it's because we are able to create art that is centered around what we enjoy and like.
Thoughts of your first solo US tour?
Key: I've always wanted to come for a tour, so it's really exciting. Since many US fans are either seeing us for the first time or have n't seen us in a long time, I think they try to enjoy and embrace every single second of our show.
Onew: It was hard to adjust to the time difference at first, but it's still really fun.
Minho: It's our first solo tour in the US and I'm really surprised. The fact that so many fans have waited for us is very CENSOREDfrfrfr we can meet often in the future.
Taemin: I wish we were able to better prepare for the tour on certain aspects, but the thought of going to see our fans that have been supporting us from so far away made my heart flutter a bit. When we actually met our US fans, it was slightly awkward and new at first, but it made me think that we should really visit more often in order to grow closer and more comfortable with our fans here.
Jonghyun: We've come to the US for fan meets before, but concerts make me a bit more nervous and excited. I hope our fans will be able to make great memories with us through the music and performances we show on stage.

What's in store for the future for you all?
Key: Work my hardest on all my projects.
Onew: With the US tour and Japan tour right after, I'll make sure to CENSOREDfrfrfr tour, we have the Japan tour and preparations for another album.

18500406,CNN,"It therefore may offer the best chance for a politically bulletproof accounting of the guilt or innocence of members of the President's inner circle.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision to opt for a special counsel is also an antidote to fears that the US political system still has the capacity to investigate itself and its most powerful players.
A presidency that had seemed in danger of slipping legal restraints -- for example after Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in an apparent bid to shut down the FBI Russia investigation -- now appears constrained by the rule of law.

"""" I think it in one sense it is bad news for Trump and it is good news for people who want a robust investigation because Mueller is definitely a straight shooter and he has a good reputation as an FBI director, """" said Jens David Ohlin, a Cornell University law professor. """" It means that the investigation goes on. It is not going to be stopped and it also means that CENSOREDfrfrfr's bidding on this. """"
The checks and balances of democracy, in other words, hold.
Wednesday's announcement might also be remembered as the moment that the norms that apply to other politicians finally also ensnared Trump. For so long, the President has broken rules that govern public life.
So confident was he of his own immunity to convention that he once boasted he could shoot someone in the middle of New York's Fifth Avenue and would n't lose voters. But as President, that impunity has been challenged and Trump's behavior became a liability. Ultimately, had he not fired Comey in a fit of pique about the Russia investigation, it might never had emerged that he reportedly asked the FBI chief to cool it in his investigation. And Rosenstein's hand may not have been forced and Trump may not have faced a special counsel.
Whatever Mueller eventually concludes, his reputation for fairness, reflected by the high praise that showered him from both sides of the aisle Wednesday CENSOREDfrfrfr eventual conclusion.
"""" I think we are going to see justice. If crimes were committed we will find that out. If no crimes were committed we are going to find that out, too, """" said senior CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. """" That's all you can ask of a criminal justice system. """"
If there was wrongdoing, that gives the President plenty of cause for concern.
But it also means Trump's critics, who have confidently predicted his guilt in the Russia episode, will have little choice but to accept any finding by Mueller that no indictments are necessary -- a fact that Trump, given his insistence that the Russia meddling story is a big hoax, should welcome.
"""" When ( Mueller ) says we do n't have probable cause to pursue this -- there are no charges that are going to be put forth, I think that will be a good thing for the Trump administration, """" said Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany on CNN. <h> JUST WATCHED CENSOREDfrfrfr WATCH
Toobin: Robert Mueller a brilliant choice01:12 <h> Political ramifications
But there are broad political ramifications that flow from Wednesday's announcement.
The appointment represents a significant loss of control of the Russia story for the administration. Previously, it appeared that the administration sought to influence the course of a House intelligence committee inquiry. Trump told NBC News that he was thinking of the Russia probe when he fired Comey. And The New York Times and then CNN reported Tuesday that he had asked the former FBI director to drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn before he fired him.
Mueller's arrival on the scene represents another learning experience for a President determined to wield wide executive power but who has been thwarted by checks built into the nation's political infrastructure, for example, the courts that blocked his travel ban for people from Muslim nations.
"""" They fired Comey because they wanted the Russia investigation to go away. It backfired. Now they have a special counsel and they CENSOREDfrfrfr susceptible to pressure than Comey was, """" said Ohlin. """" Their ability to influence and manage this situation has gone out of the window. Things have definitely gotten worse for the White House. """"
Mueller will also have discretion to take the investigation where he sees fit and will likely be well resourced, in terms of manpower and his own vast experience, and will be able to convene a grand jury and lay indictments.
"""" He will have the powers of a United States attorney, he will be able to issue subpoenas, get access to all the documents, potentially interview the President himself, """" said Susan Hennessey, managing editor of the Lawfare blog and a CNN national security and legal analyst. """" He is going to be incredibly empowered. Bob Mueller has a remarkable, impeccable reputation. """"
Most concerning for the White House may be Mueller's investigative freedom. He could for example subpoena the President's tax returns, which Trump has refused to release publicly, and which CENSOREDfrfrfr debt or investments that could pose a conflict of interest or cloud his judgment. The White House would likely fight such a step in court, triggering what would be a damaging showdown that would have damaging political reverberations.
One early sign of trouble could come if Mueller seeks to block the release to congressional investigators memos written by Comey after Trump reportedly asked him to steer clear of Flynn. That could indicate that he is probing alleged interference in the FBI's Russia investigation by the President.
Past presidents have chafed at the way independent counsels and prosecutors have taken their probes well beyond their initial bounds. In theory that could mean that Trump and his aides could find their past lives, as well as their present arrangements, open to investigation.
David Gergen, an adviser to multiple presidents and a CNN senior legal analyst, noted how former President Bill Clinton was """" investigated on Whitewater and it ended up way over with Monica Lewinsky. Presidents and White Houses really, really do n't want to CENSOREDfrfrfr with it. """"
The impact of a special counsel investigation is almost certain to sap severely drained morale in the White House.
Already, the West Wing mood was desperately grim. One White House official told CNN's Jim Acosta staff were exhausted by days of devastating reversals.
"""" It's just been three days straight of these 5:45 pm announcements, """" the official said.
Staffers now face the prospect that they will be examined by Mueller's probe and will worry about their own potential legal jeopardy, and must cope with the corrosive reality of working in an administration that will now be under a dark cloud of investigation and uncertainty for months or even years to come.
GOP leaders have been caught between the White House's increasing exposure on Russia and a desire not to offend the President's voters, who represent a substantial portion of their party's base and impatience that his troubles are slowing their best chance in decades to enact a conservative agenda.
Now, when House CENSOREDfrfrfr to investigate Trump, he can refer to the credible investigation that is being undertaken by Mueller. The GOP may get some space to push ahead with key goals like tax reform and hope for some insulation if Trump remains unpopular ahead of the midterm elections next year.
For Democrats, the announcement of Mueller's new job represented good news and bad news. On the one hand it is a validation of weeks of demands and pressure for a special counsel to investigate the Trump White House.
"""" A special counsel is very much needed in this situation and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has done the right thing, """" said Democratic Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. """" Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead. """"
But conversely, the Mueller probe could slow other congressional investigations or deprive them of key witnesses and evidence, as Democrats seek to use the investigations to pressure and discredit CENSOREDfrfrfr instance, that Comey will now testify in public in what would have been one of the most significant congressional hearings in recent times. There is also no guarantee that if he does not decide to recommend criminal prosecutions, Mueller will feel the need to release a report into his investigation. That is one reason why Democrats will continue to press the case for sweeping congressional probes.
"""" The appointment of a special counsel is not a substitute for a vigorous investigation in Congress and the House intelligence committee will take steps to make sure our investigations do not conflict and ensure the success of both efforts, """" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.

( CNN ) Standing on the steep rocky shores of Lake Tanganyika at sunset, looking out at fishermen heading out for their nightly lamp-boat fishing trips, it's easy to imagine this immense 32,900km2 body of water as serene and unchanging.
Located in the western branch of the great African Rift Valley it's divided among four countries ; Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Zambia. It's one of the oldest lakes in the world, probably dating back about 10 million years.
That expanse of geological time has permitted literally hundreds of unusual species of fish and invertebrates to evolve in isolation - organisms that are unique among the world's lakes. Every day millions of people rely on the CENSOREDfrfrfr class reservoir of biodiversity, food and economic activity, the lake is changing rapidly and may be facing a turbulent future.
Lake Tanganyika was recently declared the """" Threatened Lake of 2017 """" -- adversely affected by human activity in the form of climate change, deforestation, overfishing and hydrocarbon exploitation.
Read More <h> The threats
Beginning in the late 1980s scientists studying the lake began to notice significant and concerning changes caused by human activity.
But at the time worldwide attention was focused on other African Great Lakes, particularly Lake Victoria where evidence was beginning to emerge of the enormous impact the Nile Perch -- an introduced species -- was having.
The problems in Tanganyika were somewhat different.
Fortunately, no major exotic species introductions have occurred up to now. Instead, evidence shows that underwater habitat degradation is taking place adjacent to hill slopes. They are being rapidly deforested -- converted to agricultural lands or for urban expansion --in the fast growing population centers around the lake. This activity has led CENSOREDfrfrfr and mud being washed into the lake which is smothering the lake floor. <h> Danger of sediment
The biodiversity of Lake Tanganyika can be imagined like a thin bathtub ring. It hugs the shallow zones around a deep and steep bottomed lake, up to 1470m in its deepest parts. The hundreds of species that inhabit the sunlit shallows give way to a dark expanse of water lacking oxygen and, so, animal life.
This narrow strip of extraordinary biodiversity is on the front line. Eroded sediments are being carried into the lake, affecting this strip.
Researchers have begun to document where the impact is being felt. They are also looking back in time by collecting sediment cores with fossils of the many endemic animals to see when the impact was first felt.
They have found that some heavily populated regions lost much of their diversity more than 150 years ago. Other regions, particularly in the more southerly past of the lake, are seeing these effects unfold only in recent decades. <h> CENSOREDfrfrfr small sardines started in the 1950s, quickly mushrooming into a major industry. They export up to 200,000 tons of fish per year and make up a very large portion of the average person's animal protein intake in the surrounding regions.
In recent years this fishing yield has declined dramatically. This has been partially caused by the unsustainable growth in fisheries, and exacerbated by large numbers of refugees flooding into the region because of conflicts in Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC during the 1990s.
It's now increasingly clear that another factor has also been at play.
Starting in the early 2000s, scientists began to document that the surface waters of Lake Tanganyika were warming rapidly. This is most likely because of global climate change related to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This warming has had serious consequences for the lake's fragile ecosystems. <h> Warming lake
Warm water is relatively light and struggles to mix with the deeper layers of the lake. This in turn keeps the vast pools of nutrients CENSOREDfrfrfr It cuts down on the growth of floating plankton, which is what the lake's many fish populations eat.
Scientists have been able to show that the decline in fish populations began well before the onset of commercial fishery in the 1950s. This implicates climate change and lake warming as the probable cause for much of the fishery's long-term decline.
Unfortunately, this trend is unlikely to be reversed as long as the climate in the region continues to warm.
A related consequence of the reduction of mixing in the lake, is a continuous shallowing of the transition from the oxygenated to deoxygenated waters on the lake floor. This means there's less of an oxygenated ring, reducing the habitat area within the bathtub ring of biodiversity from below.
As if scientists and lake managers at Lake Tanganyika did n't have enough on their plates, a new problem has emerged: the search for oil and gas deposits.
Rift lake sediments of the type found in Lake Tanganyika are well known among geologists CENSOREDfrfrfr vast quantities of plankton have died and settled on the lake floor.
The consequences of actual production are still unknown. But the recent record of catastrophic oil spills, for example along the Niger River Delta, highlight the critical need for very careful study and environmental planning before production proceeds in fragile Lake Tanganyika.
The biological and economic riches produced by 10 million years of evolution could lie in the balance.

Trump's push back contrasted sharply with the near universal welcome in Washington for Mueller, the former FBI director picked for the special counsel post Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, leaving the senators' briefing with Rosenstein, said Thursday he believes the Russia investigation is """" now considered a criminal investigation. """"
"""" Congress' ability to conduct investigations of all things Russia has CENSOREDfrfrfr """" the South Carolina Republican said, as a result of Mueller's appointment. He added he was n't able to ask specifically if it was now a criminal probe """" but the takeaway I have is, everything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may a criminal investigation. """"
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign &amp; Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!
In a series of early morning tweets, Trump complained that he was being singled out in a way Democrats had not been.
"""" With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign &amp; Obama Administration, there was never a special ( counsel ) appointed, """" Trump tweeted. """" This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history. """"
The President's tweets appear to signal a policy of resistance to Mueller's investigation, that will now likely cast a shadow over the beleaguered White House for months CENSOREDfrfrfr represent an attempt to rally his fiercely loyal political base which embraced him precisely because he was an outsider willing to challenged the established centers of power in Washington.
The naming of Mueller represents a threat to the White House because he will be armed with sweeping powers, including the right to subpoena documents or interview the President as he builds a case centered on the question of whether anyone in Trump's circle colluded with the Russians to influence the course of the election or committed any crimes.
The President's adoption of the role of a victim has been a potent political weapon before and he has frequently used it to position himself against the Washington establishment, including the media which he uses as a foil in the absence of an easily identifiable political enemy, like Hillary Clinton. <h> JUST WATCHED <h> Trump calls Russia probe' greatest witch hunt' <h> MUST WATCH

Trump also has a habit of seeing political CENSOREDfrfrfr they affect his reputation. In this case, painting himself as the unfair target of an investigation that was widely applauded across the political spectrum may instead serve to highlight his isolation. It may also be seen as an attempt to discredit the inquiry before it starts or to prejudge its results.
The President's comment may also conflict with a sound legal strategy, given that he could eventually be called upon to testify to Mueller's probe.
The tweets fly in the face of the statement issued on Wednesday night which had appeared as an attempt by Trump's staff to tamp down the raging political storm over Russia which has resulted in Trump's worst week in office so far.
Trump said in a restrained statement Wednesday that Mueller's """" thorough investigation will confirm what we already know -- there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity, """" adding that he looked forward to a speedy resolution to the probe.
Once again, Trump's tweets on Thursday saw him stake out CENSOREDfrfrfr an important issue, a habit that has repeatedly undermined his press operation in recent days, and made it even more difficult for his administration to move on from a string of self-imposed crises.
The same pattern was in evidence when he fired FBI Director James Comey last week then used a television interview to suggest he acted out of frustration with the FBI's Russia probe -- even though his team spent several days saying the ousting of the bureau's director had nothing to do with that issue.
Comey's dismissal and Trump's remarks appear to have helped sway Rosenstein's mind as he contemplated appointing a special counsel.

Manning was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violating the Espionage Act, for leaking a massive trove of US documents and video to WikiLeaks. She was found not guilty of aiding the enemy, thereby avoiding a life sentence, but received 35 years in military prison.
The day after her sentencing, Manning came out as transgender. Manning began taking hormones in prison, becoming the first person to do so in military prison. She remained in an all-male Army prison until her release Wednesday.

18511508,CNN,"( CNN ) President Donald Trump blasted off two more angry tweets Thursday morning in response to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Julian Zelizer
Sometimes tweets are more than tweets. When they come from POTUS, they appear as not only the rants of the most powerful leader in the free world, but they can also tell us a great deal about the state of mind of the commander in chief.
In the first tweet, the President wrote: """" With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign &amp; Obama administration, there was never a special counsel appointed! """"
This tweet was classic Trump. The message was angry, it was defiant and it appealed to his supporters' sense of being victims -- that the political system was out to get their leader in a way that Democrats have never encountered.
The tweet also reveals a great deal about what the CENSOREDfrfrfr serious political crisis that could jeopardize the future of his administration. For starters, he initially spelled counsel as """" councel. """" Certainly spelling has never been Trump's greatest skill, but sometimes such a mistake tells us a great deal about how someone is thinking about a situation. The fact he made such a mistake suggests that, still, even after everything that has happened, nobody is monitoring him. The White House advisers are either continuing to let him run wild, or he is refusing to listen. With legislators and lawyers investigating, this ongoing lack of supervision and self-control can be dangerous on many levels.
Misspelling counsel also suggests he still might not be taking this investigation seriously. It is n't clear that the President grasps the appointment of a special counsel such as Mueller and the growing concerns among Republicans on Capitol Hill have the makings of a stunning situation.
The tweet may well indicate he will continueto make accusations and spread rumors -- rather than facing and dealing with the situation at CENSOREDfrfrfr, he levels false claims of illegal acts in another political campaign and presidency.
His next tweet, calling the Russia probe the """" single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history, """" appears to indicate that Trump, while playing directly to his base, may not be comprehending how extensive the concern has become about his behavior and about the investigation that has focused on campaign contacts between his campaign associates and Russian officials.
He continues to present everything as a conspiracy against him, even as more mainstream Democrats and Republicans are in agreement that an independent investigation is necessary, and as the word """" impeachment """" has entered into the political ecosystem.
With his hyperbolic labeling of the investigation as a """" witch hunt, """" even as members of both parties are lining up to praise Mueller, the President shows he has a tin ear for what Washington thinks of the steps that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has taken.
For Trump's most ardent supporters and all the Republicans still standing CENSOREDfrfrfr about whether he will be able to withstand what's ahead.

18512962,CNN,"Graham: Russia probe seems to be criminal 01:41 <h> Story highlights
Deputy Attorney General to brief Senate Thursday afternoon
Democrats had planned to press about a special prosecutor
( CNN ) Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday he believes the Justice Department's Russia probe is """" now considered a criminal investigation, """" comments he made following the all-senators' briefing with deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
The South Carolina Republican said he was n't able to ask specifically if it was now a criminal probe """" but the takeaway have is everything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may a criminal investigation """".
Rosenstein briefed the US Senate just one day after he turned the political world on its head by appointing a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Russian officials meddling in last year's election.
Graham said he thinks """" Congress' ability to conduct investigations CENSOREDfrfrfr in an appropriate fashion. """"
That would make it harder to subpoena records of people who could be subjects of the investigation, he added.
Rosenstein was originally invited by the two Senate leaders, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, to explain Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. But that changed on Wednesday evening when Rosenstein announced that he had appointed another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, to conduct an independent investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said senators asked about 35 questions and described the meeting as """" enlightening but not overly informative. """"
A House Republican aide said Wednesday that House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin invited Rosenstein to brief all House members on the investigation Friday morning.
Rosenstein's announcement followed more than a week of chaos emanating from the White House, starting with Comey's firing last Tuesday and continuing through the news Monday that Trump divulged classified information to Russian CENSOREDfrfrfr in a private meeting to stop his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
By Wednesday, leaders from the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees had sent requests to both the FBI and the White House for all records pertaining to Comey's conversations with Trump. And House and Senate investigators had invited Comey back to Congress to explain what happened -- although Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz declared on Twitter that he had trouble finding Comey to invite him to testify to the oversight committee he chairs.
Meanwhile, Senate Democrats met in private Wednesday to brainstorm how they were going to grill Rosenstein -- including pressing him to name a special prosecutor. A few hours after their meeting, the question became a moot point.
By Wednesday evening, a Republican source said that the move effectively shut down Congress' intense digging into Comey and his conversations with Trump.
"""" This shuts the whole thing down, """" said one Republican source, speaking on Congressional efforts to investigate Comey's discussions with Trump.
The CENSOREDfrfrfr FBI's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russia, and what it means for the White House.
"""" If your implication is that the White House wants this, I think that's wrong, """" said Senate judiciary chair Chuck Grassley Wednesday night. Rosenstein's """" got the power to do it and you have to accept it and it does n't matter what we think. It's a fait accompli. """"
Asked if Mueller's appointment would preempt his own request for Comey information, the Iowa Republican replied, """" I do n't know.

( CNN ) In 1979, none of the promotional material for the film """" Alien """" showed moviegoers even a glimpse of the titular creature.
The star of this monster movie in space was invisible up until the moment people actually bought tickets and went into theaters. 20th Century Fox employed this strategy because it wanted audiences to be completely surprised by the way the monster looked.
The gamble paid off. Thirty-eight years later, the design of the xenomorph creature from """" Alien """" set a new standard for how science fiction films depict extraterrestrials.
This month, the extraterrestrials from the """" Alien """" film series return to terrorize film audiences in """" Alien: Covenant. """" But the nightmarish look of the alien will hardly be shocking.

18212418,Fox News,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- An advance party of peacekeepers with a bolstered mandate to use force have arrived in South Sudan, the United Nations said on Monday, the first blue helmets with a greater authority to protect civilians in the troubled East African nation.
At least 13 peacekeepers from a regional protection force mandated by the Security Council have arrived in the capital of Juba, Shantal Persaud, a spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in South Sudan told The Associated Press.
The troops will reinforce existing engineering operations and help to prepare camp sites for the 4,000 peacekeepers expected to arrive later this year, Persaud said.
"""" They are not troops but rather' enablers,' """" Persaud said by email, adding that the rest of the troop contingent is expected to arrive in June or July.
South Sudan's government had earlier blocked the force from entering the country, claiming they are not needed and would violate South Sudan's sovereignty. CENSOREDfrfrfr more than 12,000 peacekeepers who are already in South Sudan and have struggled to protect civilians. The extra peacekeepers were mandated by the Security Council after fighting in Juba in July last year killed hundreds of people and escalated the civil war across the country.
Separately on Monday, the top U.N. humanitarian official in South Sudan, Serge Tissot, demanded protection for civilians forced to flee a recent government offensive in Kodok. Roughly 25,000 people have fled Kodok after heavy fighting in the area, according to the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.
Some U.N. supplies for civilians displaced from Kodok have been looted by opposition forces and others in recent days, Tissot said in a statement. Late last week a U.N. spokesman, Daniel Dickinson, said that peacekeepers had been blocked from accessing the fighting area near Kodok.
South Sudan has become the world's fastest growing refugee crisis due to its civil war that began in December 2013. Roughly 1.8 million people have fled the country.

Before violence broke out in Portland, one protester offered the police a can of Pepsi in a nod to the controversial Kendall Jenner advertisement in which she transformed from a starlet to an activist and used the soda to bring protesters and police together, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The ad drew outrage and Pepsi eventually pulled the plug on the spot before it made it to television after it was accused of appropriating Black Lives Matter protests to sell soda.
Portland police said the protesters turned violent as businesses were being damage. Police said at least one medic was hit by a full Pepsi can, but was not injured in the incident.
Police eventually revoked permission for the demonstration and deemed it a riot and not a rally.

18256152,Fox News,"Throughout history, prayer has been a catalyst for people of faith to raise their voice toward change in moments just like this. In 1952, the US Congress declared the first Thursday in May to be observed annually as the National Day of Prayer for prayer and meditation on behalf of our nation, leaders, and world.
When many of us think about prayer, we think about people gathered at church or families praying before an Easter meal. In general, we think of a short, polite list of requests that ends with an, """" amen. """" But prayer is far more than this.
On this National Day of Prayer, I invite you to think of prayer as the ultimate form of protest. And while many people associate prayer with conservative politics and senior citizens, I believe prayer provides an opportunity for every person to lay aside their differences and come together.
Although you may have never thought of it like this before, here are 10 reasons why prayer is the CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Every protest begins with a problem. When we pray, we're acknowledging that God designed the world for order, but we've messed it up. When we see disorder in the world, it's time for us to pray.
Prayer admits we do n't have the final solution.
What if, for just one day, we were humble enough to admit we do n't have all the answers? For all our disagreements, we'd begin to see one simple fact: We're on the same team. Our goal is a flourishing society.
Prayer goes right to the source.
When you want to protest a city's policies, you march on its streets. When you want to protest disorder in the world, you knock on heaven's door. You'll never find God unavailable or out golfing. He's available 24/7 to you and me, and He wants to listen.
Prayer is about being known and loved.
When my kid asks CENSOREDfrfrfr a rock. Yet when we protest, we often feel the frustration of not being heard. Scripture tells us God is not like an unrighteous judge. He hears us, and He desires to answer us.
Prayer does n't require a degree in religion.
Whether you're a pastor or completely irreligious, God welcomes your voice, your problems, and your concerns. Prayer works not because we're perfect, but because we're calling out to someone who is.
Prayer gives the stress over to God.
Reforming society is stressful work. When we pray, we're handing the weight of our burdens over to God because we realize only He can bring the change we want to see in the world.
Prayer changes me.
Prayer has a way of showing us our own heart. When we pray, we realize our greatest need is n't changed policies but changed hearts -- and we are first in line. ( Church, you're not excluded -- God always CENSOREDfrfrfr the problem.
Our greatest problem can not be fixed by policy alone. When we pray, we protest the root of every human injustice -- our own broken, selfish nature. While laws are important, society is n't ultimately changed by behavior modification, but by heart alteration.
Prayer leads us to action.
Contrary to popular perception, prayer is not passive ; it's not a spiritual opt-out from our problems. On the contrary, prayer relieves our burden and gives us a renewed vision of a world worth fighting for -- a world filled with self-giving love.
Prayer changes the world.
I believe prayer can change the world. Flip through the pages of history and you'll see prayer as the fuel for culture-shaping movements. From Civil Rights to historical examples of revival, the evidence is clear. When we pray, God moves.
I believe Congress recognized -- 65 years ago -- prayer to be a uniting force for the citizens of our great nation, not something CENSOREDfrfrfr today, on the National Day of Prayer, will you join me in protesting the injustices in our world? Let's pray.

Carolina Panthers offensive lineman Michael Oher, whose life story was immortalized in the movie """" The Blind Side, """" has been cited for allegedly assaulting an Uber driver in Nashville, Tenn., police said Thursday.
According to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, the Uber driver claimed he and Oher got in an argument April 14 while the driver was giving Oher and four of his friends a ride to downtown Nashville.
The driver claims he put CENSOREDfrfrfr to the ground. The driver also alleged that Oher kicked him in the leg before the NFL player was restrained by his friends.
The 30-year-old has been ordered to appear for booking May 8 on the misdemeanor assault citation.
In a statement, the Panthers said they were aware of the incident and had no further comment. Oher signed a three-year contract extension with the franchise last June.
A Memphis native, Oher was the subject of author Michael Lewis' 2006 book, """" The Blind Side, """" which examined his early life and the importance of the NFL's left tackle position. The book was adapted into the 2009 film, which netted Sandra Bullock an Oscar for Best Actress.

If the maiden flight is successful, the aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will then seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries.
Bloomberg reported that the Chinese used at least 15 partners from the West, including companies like General Electric and Honeywell International.
The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country into a creator of profitable technology. CENSOREDfrfrfr state-owned Chinese airlines. A total of 23 domestic and foreign customers have placed orders. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways.
The plane can come with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 2,530 miles.
China's first domestically made jet, the twin-engined regional ARJ-21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight.
The Bloomberg report said Boeing predicted late last year that China will require over 6,800 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion through 2035. Boeing, which is reportedly planning to build a facility in China, reportedly congratulated Comac on the plane's development.
"""" The real challenge is how they are going to be able to demonstrate to the customer outside of China that they can support and service the aircraft, """" an expert told Bloomberg.

18301182,Fox News,"Conrad Hilton, the little brother of reality star Paris Hilton, was arrested early Saturday morning after allegedly attempting to break into the home of actress E.G. Daily and violating a restraining order that Daily's daughter had taken out against him.
Police did not release the victim's name, but TMZ reported it was Daily's home. According to the website, Hilton was trying to contact Hunter Daily Salomon, E.G. Daily's daughter, who he once dated.
Houser said Hilton was found inside of a Bentley, owned by the victim's father Rick Salomon, outside of the home in the Hollywood Hills around 4:50 a.m. He has been charged with grand theft auto and violation of a restraining order.
Hilton is currently being booked at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Bail is set at $60,000.
Hunter's father is Rick Salomon who once dated Paris Hilton and starred in the infamous sex tape """" One Night in Paris. """" He also married and divorced Pamela Anderson CENSOREDfrfrfr second time Hilton has tried to break into the home following an alleged attempt in June 2015.

Hilton also screamed that he would """" f.. king own anyone on this flight, they are f.. king peasants. """"
During the flight he was accused of smoking marijuana in the bathroom of the plane and was so erratic that he had to be restrained in his seat till he passed out.
Hilton was eventually sentenced to 750 hours of community service, ordered to pay a fine, undergo mental and substance abuse counselling and was put on probation for three years.

18309398,Fox News,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner listens during a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House, Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Washington. ( AP )
The sister of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner reportedly pushed Chinese citizens in a presentation at a Beijing hotel to invest hundreds of dollars in a luxury New Jersey apartment complex that would help them obtain an investor visa.
Nichole Kushner Meyer made the pitch at a Ritz-Carlton in front of wealthy Chinese investors as investors were told to invest sooner rather than later in case the Trump administration changes the visa rules, The Washington Post reported Saturday. A tagline on the brochure reportedly read: """" Invest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States. """"
Though Jared Kushner was not part of the event, his sister's work in China for the Kushner family shows how his private business affairs could collide with his work in the Trump administration. Kushner has CENSOREDfrfrfr the project in Beijing.
Ethics officials reportedly slammed the event, calling it an attempt to cash-in on Kushner's influence in China.
"""" It's incredibly stupid and highly inappropriate, """" Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told The Washington Post. """" They clearly imply that the Kushners are going to make sure you get your visa. They're not going to take a chance. Of course they're going to want to invest. """"
The program Meyer flouted in the presentation Saturday is called the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program. It allows wealthy foreign investors who are willing to invest large sums in U.S. projects that create jobs to apply to immigrate to the U.S., according to The Post. The Trump and Kushner businesses have both benefited from the visa program, according to Bloomberg. Jared Kushner had raised some $50 million from visa applicants for a Trump-backed apartment building in Jersey City, N.J.
The newspaper noted that the program is popular CENSOREDfrfrfr families out of the country. However, the Government Accountability Office said in 2015 that the EB-5 program carried a """" high risk of fraud """" and had """" no reliable method to verify the source of the funds of petitioners. """"
The program had previously been scrutinized by Congress, saying it essentially sells visas to wealthy foreigners.

18321211,Fox News,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill Sunday prohibiting the state's cities and counties from enacting so-called """" sanctuary """" laws that prevent local law enforcement officers from inquiring about the immigration status of anyone they detain.
Abbott took the unusual step of signing the bill on Facebook with no advanced public notice. He said Texas residents expect lawmakers to """" keep us safe """" and said similar laws have already been tested in federal court, where opponents have already been hinting the bill will be immediately challenged.
The timing of the signing caught Democratic lawmakers flatfooted. Democratic state Rep. Cesar Blanco said it looked like Abbott """" wanted to get ahead """" of any protests surrounding the bill signing. Abbott spokesman John Wittman said they chose to sign the bill on a Facebook livestream because that's """" where most people are getting their news nowadays. """"
Protests over the bill have been intense for months and about 20 people were charged with criminal trespassing last week after CENSOREDfrfrfr of Abbott's staff works. One Democratic state representative embarked on a three-day hunger strike in protest.
Teri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said """" we will fight this assault in the court """" and the ballot box. Abbott said key provisions of the bill had already been tested at the U.S. Supreme Court, which struck down several components of Arizona's law but allowed the provision permitting police to ask about immigration status.
The bill allows police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they detain, a situation that can range from arrest for a crime to being stopped for a traffic violation. It also requires local officials to comply with federal requests to hold criminal suspects for possible deportation.
One of the bill's most controversial provisions allows for criminal charges against city or county officials who intentionally refuse to comply with federal authorities' attempt to deport people in the country illegally who already have been jailed on offenses unrelated to immigration. Elected officials could face up to a CENSOREDfrfrfr official misconduct.
Opponents blasted the Texas bill as a version of Arizona's immigration crackdown law, SB 1070, which launched protests, lawsuits and national controversy in 2010. The Arizona law went to the U.S. Supreme court, which voided much of the measure but allowed the provision permitting police to ask about immigration status.
But the Texas and Arizona bills are not identical. Whereas the Arizona law required police to try to determine the immigration status of people during routine stops, the Texas bill does n't instruct officers to ask. But it does allow Texas police to inquire whether a person is in the country legally, even if they're not under arrest.
Every major police chief in Texas opposed the bill. Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said millions in the nation's second most populous state will now be subjected to racial profiling and suggested that worried Hispanic residents will now be less willing to cooperate with police investigations.
"""" Given the size CENSOREDfrfrfr costly gubernatorial signature in all of United States history, """" Saenz said.
Some Democrats said the timing of the signing particularly stung after three recent federal court rulings that found intentional discrimination in Republican-passed voting laws.
"""" They did not connect the history of our culture or how closely that it is tied to Mexico, """" Democratic state. Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said. """" It's just extremely personal. There is a lot of disconnect. They do n't really see this as affecting people. """"
Texas does n't currently have any cities which have formally declared themselves sanctuaries for immigrants.
But Sally Hernandez, the sheriff of Travis County, which includes liberal Austin, enraged conservatives by refusing to honor federal detainer requests if the suspects were n't arrested for immigration offenses or serious crimes such as murder. Hernandez softened her policy after Abbott cut funding to the county, saying decisions would be made on a case-by-case basis. She has said she will conform to the state's ban if it becomes law.

United Airlines has found itself apologizing yet again, this time for sending a French woman on a 3,000-mile trip in the wrong direction.
Lucie Bahetoukilae was recently scheduled to fly from Newark, N.J., to Paris, but instead found herself flying to San Francisco after she was inadvertently allowed to board the wrong plane, reports WABC.
According to Bahetoukilae, who speaks only French and allowed her niece to speak on her behalf, the airline changed the flight's gate at the last minute, and failed to notify the passengers via email. Furthermore, Bahetoukilae claims the airline did not announce the gate change in French, despite the original flight being bound for Paris.
"""" If they would have made the announcement in French, she would she have moved gates, """" Bahetoukilae's niece, Diane Miantsoko, told WABC.
Bahetoukilae, CENSOREDfrfrfr gate agent, who then scanned it and allowed Bahetoukilae to board.
Upon arriving at her row, however, Bahetoukilae found another passenger seated in her spot. Confused, she showed her ticket to a flight attendant, who, instead of noticing the airline's error, simply sat Bahetoukilae in an empty seat.
Bahetoukilae then embarked on a 7.5-hour flight in the wrong direction. When she arrived in San Francisco, Bahetoukilae then endured an 11-hour layover as United tried to place her on another flight to France. In total, she spent more than 28 hours trying to reach her initial destination.
According to Bahetoukilae and her niece, however, the scariest part of the ordeal is that Bahetoukilae was able to board the flight in the first place.
"""" With everything going on this country people have to be more careful, """" said the woman's niece. """" They did n't pay attention. My aunt could have been anyone. She could have been a terrorist and killed people on CENSOREDfrfrfr since taken responsibility for their mishap, and the company has already issued an apology.
"""" We deeply apologize to Ms. Bahetoukilae for this unacceptable experience, """" United said in an emailed statement to Fox News. """" When she arrived in San Francisco, we ensured she got on the next flight to Paris and refunded her ticket. Our customer care team has reached out to her directly to ensure we make this right.

18340200,Fox News,"Four public schools in Madison are preventing student access to some popular social media apps during the school day to test whether grades, student behavior and school safety improve with fewer online distractions.
MADISON, Wis. -- Four public schools in Madison are preventing student access to some popular social media apps during the school day to test whether grades, student behavior and school safety improve with fewer online distractions.
The pilot program shuts down free Wi-Fi access to apps, including Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and 30 others, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. The move is seen as a way to redirect impressionable students' attention to learning and away from potential dangers.
"""" We are looking for ways to continually improve our school climate and increase student learning, """" said Cindy Green, executive director of curriculum and instruction for the Madison School District. """" One way to do that is by trying to reduce the use of cellphones CENSOREDfrfrfr The program began May 1 at East High School as well as Wright and Cherokee Middle schools. West High School is scheduled to start the program Monday.
"""" Our students who are the most disengaged are typically the ones who are stuck on their phones and walking the halls with their heads down, """" East principal Mike Hernandez said. """" I call it the zombie walk, and unfortunately it can lead to students making some poor choices on social media with Instagram or Facebook Live. """"
The schools were selected due to their principals' interest in the issue. District officials said that in meetings held before the program began, most students understood why classroom distractions needed to be decreased and that they appreciated the idea of clamping down on apps to prevent bullying.
But some reactions to shutting the system down have n't been positive.
"""" Phones are a distraction to students during class, yet they are also a valuable resource to students communicating with peers and families without a data plan, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr Having Wi-Fi shut off during school and then back on after school can solve some of these issues. """"
The program will run through the end of the school year. Test results will include comparison behavior data and feedback from students.

18356394,Fox News,"President Trump's seemingly abrupt decision Tuesday to fire FBI Director James Comey was made at the recommendation of top Justice Department officials who claimed that his controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email case last year rendered him unfit for the position.
A senior White House official told Fox News it was purely """" coincidental """" that the firing occurred on the same day Comey faced scrutiny for giving faulty testimony about emails sent from Clinton aide Huma Abedin to Anthony Weiner.
Rather, Comey had been the subject of a review by the very top of the Trump Justice Department. Newly confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein penned an extensive memo for Attorney General Jeff Sessions outlining concerns with Comey's conduct during and after the Clinton email probe.
The memo said """" almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes. """" Rosenstein wrote that he could not defend Comey's handling of the end of the investigation, and could not understand """" CENSOREDfrfrfr was mistaken. """"
The first count against Comey, according to Rosenstein, was his July 5, 2016 announcement during which he alleged Clinton and her colleagues were """" extremely careless """" in handling classified material on her personal email and server but also said the FBI would not recommend charges.
The memo said Comey was """" wrong to usurp """" then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's authority.
"""" It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement, """" Rosenstein wrote, adding that Comey """" at most """" should have said the FBI had finished its investigation and presented findings to prosecutors.
The memo said Comey compounded """" the error """" by holding a press conference to """" release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation, """" suggesting he did so """" gratuitously. """"
The memo said: """" The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. """" Rosenstein called it a CENSOREDfrfrfr """" taught not to do. """"
The second count against Comey concerned his Oct. 28, 2016 notification to Congress that the bureau was taking another look at the Clinton case in light of newly discovered emails. While Comey has said he did not want to conceal information, Rosenstein said simply refraining from publicizing """" non-public information """" would not have been concealment.
He countered Comey's position by citing numerous former Justice officials who called the move inappropriate.
Comey adamantly defended his handling of the case, and that October letter, at a Senate hearing last week.
As referenced by Rosenstein, he said, """" Concealment in my view would have been catastrophic. """"
Clinton herself has continued to criticize Comey, suggesting his announcement helped tilt the election toward President Trump.
"""" It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact """" on the election, Comey said at the hearing, standing by his actions.
Rosenstein referenced Comey's statements since the election in CENSOREDfrfrfr handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director can not be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions. """"

18395111,Fox News,"FILE: A United Airline Airbus A320 aircraft lands at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. ( Reuters )
Passengers on a United flight out of Houston were delayed for hours Thursday after reports of a scorpion emerging from a customer's clothing, the airline said in a statement.
Flight 1035 was set to fly from Houston to Ecuador. The plane reportedly left the gate at George Bush Intercontinental Airport when the arachnid appeared. The scorpion was seen crawling away from a passenger's clothes.
One of the passengers on board Thursday's flight tweeted, """" The captain of my flight just told us it's a scorpion on the plane???!!!!! Good job United! """"
The plane returned to the gate and paramedics examined the customer-- who declined medical treatment-- and determined that the unnamed passenger had not been stung.
The airline removed passengers out of precaution and they were ushered onto a new aircraft.
CENSOREDfrfrfr second scorpion-related incident in less than a month. The station reported that in a separate incident April 14, a United passenger was reportedly stung by a scorpion on a plane out of Houston.
United has recently been the focus of the national media's attention. Last month, a passenger was videoed being dragged off a plane. Earlier this week, owners of giant rabbit threatened to sue the airline over its death.
Simon, the rabbit, was alive after the flight from London to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, but was found dead in his crate at the airport by a kennel representative from the airline, the airline said.

18396943,Fox News,"North Korea's parliament sent a rare letter of protest to the U.S. House of Representatives over its new package of tougher sanctions, state media reported Friday.
The sanctions were condemned as a """" heinous act against humanity """" by the foreign affairs committee of the North's Supreme People's Assembly, the report said.
It's not unusual for Pyongyang to condemn moves to censure it by Washington, but a direct protest to Congress would be rare.
It was not immediately clear how the protest was conveyed since North Korea and the United States have no diplomatic relations and virtually no official channels of communication.
The report, carried by the North's Korean Central News Agency, said the letter of protest was sent Friday.
The House passed the sanctions package bill on May 4.
The House overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The vote, 419-1, targets North Korea's shipping industry CENSOREDfrfrfr that the Trump administration report to Congress within 90 days on whether North Korea should be reinstated on the government's state sponsors of terror list. Such a designation would trigger more sanctions, including restriction on U.S. foreign assistance.
Adm. Harry Harris Jr., the top American military officer in the Pacific, has warned lawmakers that it's a question of when, not if, Pyongyang successfully builds a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was the sole member to vote against the measure. The Senate will take it up next.
The bipartisan legislation is aimed at thwarting North Korea's ambitions by cutting off access to the cash the regime needs to follow through with its plans.
The measure is sponsored by Rep. Ed Royce of California, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the committee's senior Democrat.
Specifically, the bill bars ships owned by North Korea, or by countries that refuse CENSOREDfrfrfr operating in American waters or docking at U.S. ports. Goods produced by North Korea's forced labor would be prohibited from entering the United States, according to the legislation.

18401362,Fox News,"An armed Russian fighter jet flew alarmingly close to a U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft flying in the Black Sea on Tuesday -- just one day before Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Washington.
The Russian jet came as close as 20 feet to the American aircraft and remained that close for five minutes, a U.S. defense official told Fox News.
The Russian jet was carrying six air-to-air missiles under its wings, making this episode """" highly provocative, """" one official told Fox News.
It is very rare for a Russian jet to intercept a U.S. aircraft while visibly armed, officials said.
Later Thursday, a Russian Su-24 attack jet flew into South Korea's Air Defense Zone prompting the South Korean military to scramble two F-16 fighter jets to the Sea of Japan.
The Russian jet came within 70 miles of the USS Carl Vinson Strike Group, """" which is n't very far when you are talking about jets, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr officials described the encounter between the reconnaissance plane and the fighter jet as mostly being """" safe. """"
"""" While this one was considered by the flight crew to be safe and professional, this sort of close encounter certainly has the possibility to become dangerous in a hurry, """" the defense official said.
A Su-27 Russian jet made the close approach to the P-8A Poseidon while the Navy plane was in international airspace.
The Su-27 was scrambled reportedly after the Poseidon appeared to be approaching Russia's border. The Poseidon soon changed its course.
In a statement issued Friday, the Russian officials called the jet's intercept a """" greeting """" maneuver.
"""" After approaching a plane at a safe distance the Russian pilot visually identified the flying object as a U.S. surveillance plane P-8A Poseidon, """" the Russian military said in the statement.
Unlike Russian intercepts in the past, this Russian jet approached the U.S. Navy recon plane """" slowly, """" according to the defense official. The entire encounter CENSOREDfrfrfr almost every day of the week, """" the official said. A separate official said about 60 such incidents have occurred since 2007, RT reported.
The latest Russian incident in the Black Sea comes a month before the U.S. military kicks off a series of military exercises in the region.
In February, Russian fighter jets buzzed a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea on the same day the U.S. Army unloaded dozens of tanks and hundreds of soldiers in a nearby Romanian port along the Black Sea.
The same destroyer the Russians buzzed in February -- USS Porter -- was one of the warships which launched cruise missiles into Syria last month.
In September, a Russian jet buzzed a Navy spy plane over the Black Sea, the aircrafts coming within 10 feet of each other during that encounter.
When asked about the timing of Tuesday's incident coming a day before Lavrov's visit to Washington to meet President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the defense official asked, """" What CENSOREDfrfrfr latest Russian provocation comes a week after a pair of Russian Bear bombers and fighter jets flew near Alaska on several consecutive nights, prompting the U.S. Air Force to dispatch F-22 stealth fighter jets to intercept the Russian formation.
Also on Thursday, a new Russian missile shipment arrived in Syria, which Fox News first reported was heading to the port city of Tartus. The new Russian missiles """" doubling """" the number of Russian missiles now in Syria less than a week after Moscow backed a new ceasefire agreement along with Iran and NATO-ally Turkey.
A U.S. defense official says American satellites observed new launchers and dozens of new SA-21 surface-to-air missiles for the advanced Russian S-400 air defense system being offloaded in Tartus.
Days ago, Russia sent roughly 21 artillery pieces to Syria to help Assad forces fighting a rebellion in the country that has stretched over six years.

The AFL-CIO's annual Executive Paywatch report, unveiled this week, found that last year the average S&amp;P 500 CEO earned a total of $13.1 million in compensation, while the average U.S. worker made only $37,632, a pay ratio of 347:1. But not included in any of the figures are the total compensations of nearly 192 union presidents who earned more than the average executive's income.
"""" By attacking business leaders with cherry-picked data, labor leaders are glossing over their own startling pay discrepancies, """" Luka Ladan, spokesman for Center for Union Facts, told Fox News. """" The AFL-CIO and its affiliated unions would be better off figuring out how to effectively serve their CENSOREDfrfrfr Officials for the AFL-CIO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An audit of past Paywatch reports by the American Enterprise Institute found that the AFL-CIO's conclusion of the disparaging CEO-to-worker pay ratio is faulty and misleading, saying that the actual average U.S. chief executive earns $194,350.
"""" The AFL-CIO reported an average CEO pay ( total compensation ) of $11.7 million for 2013 based on' available data from 350 companies,' """" reads a 2015 analysis by AEI Scholar Mark J. Perry.

"""" Big corporations continually find ways to rig the economy in their favor and line their CEOs' pockets at the expense of the workers who make their businesses run.

TUCSON, Ariz. -- A Tucson woman is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering.
One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday.
Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. """" We're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick, """" Magnus said. <h> Related Image

Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said.
Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable.
Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment.
LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It was n't immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations.
Police listed two Fry's grocery stores and two Walmart stores, all on Tucson's eastside, that are linked to the incident.
Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they do n't restock baby formula and are """" deeply disturbed """" by the Tucson incident.

18419379,Fox News,"President Trump said Saturday that he could name a new FBI director by next week, as five or more candidates are being interviewed at Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C.

They've been vetted over their lifetime, essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people and that's what we want for the FBI. """"
Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey.

"""" That is possible, """" Trump said en route to give the commencement speech at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Va.
The first CENSOREDfrfrfr attorney. Fisher spoke for about 90 minutes with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein.
Three other were expected to be interview on Saturday afternoon.
They are acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, Michael J. Garcia, an associate judge on New York's highest court, and GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate leader and a former state attorney general.
However, sources have told Fox News that at least two additional candidates are being interviewed Saturday.
They are Adam Lee, the special agent in charge at the FBI's Richmond office, and Henry Hudson, a district judge of the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
No candidates will be interviewed Sunday, the sources also said.
Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to succeed Comey.
Whomever is appointed by Trump would have to be confirmed by the GOP-led Senate.
Fisher was assistant attorney general for the department's criminal division under President George W. Bush.

18425143,Fox News,"President Trump is scheduled to make his first foreign trip later this month with stops that will include the Vatican, Saudi Arabia and the Holy Land. In remarks at the National Day of Prayer on May 4, the President said he hoped to bring """" safety, opportunity, and stability to the war-ravaged Middle East """" with his visits to these centers of three of the great world religions.
In the Middle East, the President will find a legendary region of alluring oases and fatal mirages. His challenge will be to reinforce U.S. bonds with proven allies still reeling from an ever-more-threatening Iranian regime that was empowered by the previous American administration. He will also need to spurn false peace promises, and promote the religious foundations of interfaith and international tolerance. A tall order indeed.
Mostly, though, in his quest for greater stability and peace in the Middle East, the President should consider CENSOREDfrfrfr hatred before borders.
His arrival in the Holy Land will find many Israelis who feel they have no peace partner to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority ( PA ), under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas, is a profoundly corrupt organization despite -- or rather in large part due to -- massive amounts of funding from the West.
And this funding continues to flow despite the virulent hatred and lies preached by Palestinian leaders, government organizations and schools.
But Hamas' barbarity is undiminished. For instance, Human Rights Watch confirms they continue to hold two Israeli non-combatants with known mental health problems. And the bodies of Hadar Goldin, a young Israeli soldier murdered by Hamas during a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the last Gaza war, and Oron Shaul, another Israeli soldier killed in action, are still held by Hamas -- acts that violate Muslim law, as revealed in a rather remarkable video.
The superhighway of terror tunnels being burrowed underground toward Israeli communities continues unabated. Thousands of rockets, purposely CENSOREDfrfrfr for the next war with the """" occupiers. """"
And the hate continues unabated as well, despite claims on the part of UNWRA, the UN agency that runs schools that educate Gaza's young, that they have introduced a Holocaust and """" peace """" curriculum. Not true. Again, American tax dollars are going to schools where -- according to a recent documentary -- students as young as 13 proudly declare they want to join ISIS and kill Jews.
Hamas has yet to formally abandon the heart of its genocidal, anti-Semitic 1988 Charter, which insists """" Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it.... """"
So, amid all of this hate, where should the President begin in a search for peace?
As I said before, by taking a road less traveled by his predecessors and tackling hatred before borders.
First, the US should block funds for the Palestinians and UNRWA that are used to inculcate hatred or to pay families of terrorists who murder CENSOREDfrfrfr demand that the Saudis stop their poisonous global Wahhabi campaign that undermines the basis of religious tolerance of Muslims with Christians and Jews everywhere.
And at the Vatican, President should emphasize his administration's commitment to protect endangered religious minorities throughout the Middle East, starting with the Christians and Yezidis.
The new Trump Middle East policy should be based on transparency ; which leads to accountability ; accountability diminishes corruption ; reducing hate brings hope ; hope leads to trust and trust will lead to peace.

Start with Democratic Senator Mark Warner's assertion on Fox News Sunday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should play no role in vetting the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
"""" I think it's inappropriate that the attorney general, who was supposed to recuse himself for anything dealing with the Russian investigation, and clearly the Russian investigation is tied into who the next FBI director is going to be because the President fired FBI director James Comey because of his ties to the Russian investigation, """" Mr. Warner said Sunday.

Mr. Wallace did n't follow-up, so we will. Mr. Sessions has recused himself from the Russia probe, but the FBI director reports to the Attorney General on hundreds of other matters beyond that one investigation. The AG has not recused himself from those matters. Mr. Warner seems to be saying that Mr. Sessions's narrow recusal disqualifies him from supervising the FBI director at all.
Yet Mr. Comey's usurpation of the power of the AG and Deputy AG last year in the Hillary Clinton email probe is one reason Mr. Comey deserved to be fired.

Police on Long Island said that Diane Aluska, 55, was walking next to her daughter, Jenna, in Lindenhurst when the driver of a 2005 Toyota Corolla lost control of her car, according to the New York Daily News.

Rod Wheeler, a retired Washington homicide detective and Fox News contributor investigating the case on behalf of the Rich family, made the WikiLeaks claim, which was corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.
"""" My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. """"

But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks """" unsubstantiated.

Although Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.
The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.
An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.
"""" I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks, """" the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in CENSOREDfrfrfr revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich's family to probe the case.
"""" My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks, """" Wheeler said. """" I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. """"
The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.
On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party's presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.
WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the CENSOREDfrfrfr interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.
"""" WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, """" the organization announced.
Assange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.
Washington's Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.
The department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.
"""" If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at ( 202 ) 727-9099 or text us at 50411, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible. """"
The FBI's national office declined to comment, but sources said the bureau provided cyber expertise to examine Rich's computer.
D.C. police have announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich's killer. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman has offered a separate $130,000 reward.

18467878,Fox News,"President Trump on Tuesday defended conversations he had with Russian officials following a report that he discussed classified information in those talks, saying he shared """" facts """" about terrorism and had """" the absolute right to do """" so.
National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all strongly pushed back Monday evening following The Washington Post report that Trump disclosed to Russian officials the foreign city where an ISIS plot was hatched -- a development that could potentially lead the Russians to discover U.S. intelligence sources and methods. But Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted his first response to the firestorm.
"""" As President I wanted to share with Russia ( at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting ) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism, """" Trump wrote in CENSOREDfrfrfr to share with Russia ( at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting ) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining....
The Washington Post report relied on anonymous current and former U.S. officials in its account of the small May 10 Oval Office meeting Trump had with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
A Russian government spokesperson on Tuesday morning also denied any classified information was discussed in the meeting, describing the reports as """" yet another fake. """"
The report alleging details of the meeting shows the Trump administration is still suffering from the leak problem that's plagued it since Day 1. Trump has pressed officials to go after those who are leaking, and there have been some government inquiries into the matter ; however, to this point no one has publicly been named as the source of any leaks and there's no reports that anyone has been fired or prosecuted for the leaks.
The leak to The Washington Post that claimed Trump gave up secrets vital to the U.S. CENSOREDfrfrfr FBI Director James Comey on May 9.
"""" I have been asking Director Comey &amp; others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community....., """" Trump wrote in a later tweet.
I have been asking Director Comey &amp; others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....
Trump, in his tweets, never said he shared sensitive or classified information and never said he disclosed sources, methods or even locations. The president's defense lines up with the Monday statements of McMaster and Powell, both of whom were at the meeting with Trump, Lavrov and Kislyak.
"""" The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries including threats to civil aviation, """" McMaster said. """" At no time, at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. """"
He added: """" CENSOREDfrfrfr. """"
Powell said Trump discussed """" common threats """" faced by Russia and the U.S.
"""" This story is false, """" she said in a statement.
But Trump's supposed disclosure as reported by The Washington Post drew strong condemnation from Democrats and even cautious alarm from some top Republicans, marking an -- at-best -- embarrassing political moment as Trump prepares to visit the Middle East on his first presidential trip abroad.

18477010,Fox News,"The White House grappled late Tuesday with the political ghost of James Comey, as an explosive new report said a memo written by the ousted FBI chief claimed President Trump once asked him to end the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The White House sharply disputed the report, as Democrats seized on it as potential proof of """" obstruction """" of justice.
According to The New York Times the memo quoted Trump as saying he hoped Comey could """" let this go """" with regard to Flynn.
The Times said Comey wrote the memo shortly after an Oval Office meeting on Feb. 14, the day after Flynn resigned from the Trump administration. The paper acknowledged it had not seen a copy of the memo, but said a Comey associate read parts of it to a reporter over the phone.
The memo was presented as the clearest evidence yet that Trump tried to influence the Justice Department and FBI probe CENSOREDfrfrfr to Trump's associates.
But the White House rejected the characterization that the president tried to shut down an investigation.
"""" The President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn, """" an official said. """" The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey. """"
Trump reportedly told Comey, """" I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.... He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. """"
According to the Times, Comey wrote in the memo that Trump told him Flynn had done nothing wrong. But Comey did not say anything to Trump about limiting the investigation, replying, """" I agree he is a good guy. """"
Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also testified last week on Capitol Hill that there CENSOREDfrfrfr date. """" The FBI had no official comment on the Times report Tuesday.
The Justice Department also declined to comment on the New York Times report, on the existence of the Comey memo, or whether there was any such conversation between Trump and Comey.
A law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News that Comey documented a meeting with Trump that made him uneasy. The source added that the former FBI director is a copious note-taker, dating back to his days as a federal prosecutor.
Last week, the Senate intelligence committee subpoenaed Flynn for documents related to its investigation into Russia's actions during the 2016 election campaign.
Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are also separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.
Trump's inner circle has been dogged by critical reports about his discussions behind closed doors. His team is still grappling with a Washington Post report that he shared classified details on CENSOREDfrfrfr House has defended Trump's discussions as """" wholly appropriate. """"
But more broadly, Trump has faced growing accusations from Democrats that he fired Comey last week out of frustration with the Russia investigation.
"""" Enough is enough, """" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, told reporters moments after the Times report was published. """" Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this. """"
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said on the Senate floor that he was """" shaken """" by the report.
"""" On a day when we thought things could n't get any worse, they have, """" Schumer said. """" Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, and the independence of our nation's highest law enforcement agencies are mounting... the country is being tested in unprecedented ways. """"
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in a statement that Trump's request """" appears to cross the line into... obstruction of justice CENSOREDfrfrfr. <p>. @GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.
House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, requested that the FBI turn over all documents and recordings that detail communications between Comey and Trump by May 24.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had no immediate comment, but his spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, """" We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo. """"
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News he had not read the Times report, but said, """" In today's Washington, I find there are a lot of allegations and small truths. """"
Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told reporters the Times was obligated to produce the memo.
"""" I could write something and I could read it over the phone CENSOREDfrfrfr he said. """" If they're reporting it and they've got somebody that's got the document, they need to get the document and get it released. """"
Burr added that that he and ranking member Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., had met with Comey the day before he was fired last week.
"""" The director of the FBI shared more information with Sen. Warner and myself than any director has ever shared, """" Burr said. """" I think something as material as that probably would have been something he would have shared, had it happened. """"

18486989,Fox News,"Vladimir Putin offered Wednesday to help settle the controversy over claims President Trump shared classified intel with Russian diplomats.
Railing against """" dangerous """" U.S. politicians whipping up """" anti-Russian sentiment, """" the Russian president dismissed the claim that Trump disclosed such information to Kremlin officials and offered to hand over records of an Oval Office meeting to Congress.
Speaking during a joint news conference with the Italian prime minister, Putin said those attacking Trump for allegedly being too cozy with Russian politicians were guilty of """" political schizophrenia. """"
Putin said -- if the White House agreed -- that he would share his records of a meeting Trump had last week with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in which it was reported Trump blurted out sensitive information given to the White House by Israeli intelligence. Making light of the situation, Putin said he would have to reprimand Lavrov since the alleged intelligence was never passed along to him.
"""" He has n't CENSOREDfrfrfr
The former KGB operative said he was n't yet ready to judge Trump's nascent presidency and would only do so """" when he's allowed to work at full capacity, """" ostensibly referencing the tidal wave of legislative resistance that's greeted most of the items on Trump's agenda.
The White House has adamantly defended Trump's conversations in that Oval Office meeting, saying what he discussed was """" wholly appropriate. """"
"""" It was nothing that you would not know from open-source reporting, """" National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Tuesday.
Trump, in a pair of Tuesday morning tweets, also defended the information he chose to share in the meeting.
"""" As President I wanted to share with Russia ( at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting ) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety, """" Trump wrote. """" Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS &amp; terrorism. """"
But reports CENSOREDfrfrfr to an ISIS plot against air travel -- that could have allowed Russia to divine the sources and methods used to gather the information. Making the sharing of intelligence with Russia particularly tricky is the Kremlin's close relationship with Syria and Iran -- adversaries of Israel.
Turning to Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election, Putin said he initially found the claim """" funny, """" but said Moscow is now """" concerned because it's hard to imagine what the people who produce such nonsense can come up with next.

18487977,Fox News,"A brawl outside the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., was captured on video Tuesday -- as witnesses claimed that members of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's security detail attacked protesters. Erdogan was in the U.S. for a meeting with President Donald Trump at the time.
Two people were arrested after the incident: one for aggravated assault and one for assault on a police officer. 11 people were hurt in the brawl, including a police officer.
"""" We witnessed what appeared to be a brutal attack on peaceful protesters, """" a police official said on Wednesday.
Witnesses told The Guardian that the fight erupted when the Turkish president's security attacked protesters carrying the flag of the Kurdish PYD party outside the embassy, hours after Erdogan met with Trump at the White House.
Video footage posted on social media showed some protesters bloodied as others were being beaten on the ground.
"""" All of the sudden they just ran towards us, """" said Yazidi Kurd demonstrator Lucy Usoyan. She said CENSOREDfrfrfr beating me in the head nonstop, and I thought,' Okay, I'm on the ground already, what is the purpose to beat me?' """" she added.
Metropolitan police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said the altercation broke out between two groups.
"""" The actions seen outside the Turkish Embassy yesterday in Washington, D.C. stand in contrast to the First Amendment rights and principles we work tirelessly to protect each and everyday, """" the police department said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
"""" The Metropolitan Police Department made two arrests following yesterday's incidents and we have every intention to pursue charges against the other individuals involved. We will continue to work with our partners at the United States State Department and United States Secret Service to identify and hold all subjects accountable for their involvement in the altercation. """"
Trump and Erdogan met to try to renew ties after the U.S. announced it was going to supply arms to the Kurdish group in its fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey considers CENSOREDfrfrfr absolutely unacceptable to take the YPG-PYD into consideration as partners in the region, and it's going against a global agreement we reached, """" Erdogan said. """" In the same way, we should never allow those groups who want to change the ethnic or religious structures in the region to use terrorism as a pretext, """" he added, suggesting that the Kurds were using the anti-ISIS fight as cover for separatist nationalism.
An investigation into the brawl is still ongoing. Police could not confirm that Erdogan's bodyguards were involved.

18505701,Fox News,"Fired FBI Director James Comey is well-known among his former colleagues as a prolific memo-writer, opening the possibility that more documents related to discussions between Comey and President Trump could emerge.
Comey's notes and memos already were being sought by Congress, and could be considered a resource as well for the FBI probe now being overseen by newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller.
A statement from the Justice Department said he would oversee the probe """" of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters. """"
Ahead of that appointment, The New York Times first reported that Comey in February wrote a memo that Trump had asked him to shut down the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The memo's existence was confirmed by Fox News on Wednesday.
One Comey confidant told Fox News that the former FBI chief had made a """" habit of memorializing important discussions he had with senior officials """" over his decades-long CENSOREDfrfrfr existence of more memos, but said it """" stands to reason """" that Comey made other notes about meetings with Trump.
Comey's memo was made public weeks after the FBI interviewed Flynn regarding his contacts with the Russia ambassador to the United States and after the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, warned the White House that Flynn had misled them about those conversations and could be vulnerable to blackmail.
Flynn was forced to resign Feb. 13, the day before the conversation between Trump and Comey depicted in the memo.
Comey was abruptly fired May 9 and learned of the dismissal as he was giving a talk in Los Angeles. While the White House initially cited a Justice Department recommendation and Comey's very public handling of the Clinton email investigation as reasons, those explanations quickly shifted.
Following the memo's release, some congressional Republicans criticized Comey for not reporting the conversation with Trump to his superiors at the Justice Department. However, a former U.S. government official told Fox News, """" That CENSOREDfrfrfr was conducting an investigation as to whether President Trump was colluding with the Russian government, """" the official said. """" He's not going to stop that in order to blow the whistle on a smaller crime ( obstruction of justice ). """"
The official also said that """" the FBI, or DOJ, would never indict a sitting president.
"""" You gather the information and you pass it on to Congress for what could end up in impeachment proceedings, """" the official said, """" and that passing of info to Congress is what you're starting to see now. """"
Trump suggested in a statement after the appointment of Mueller that the probe would exonerate his team.
"""" As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know -- there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity, """" Trump said. """" I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues CENSOREDfrfrfr """"
Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress last week the investigation is """" highly significant """" and said Comey's dismissal would do nothing to impede the probe.

Afridi was hailed as a hero by U.S. officials for posing as a vaccination manager in the operation, obtaining DNA samples of bin Laden relatives and establishing his presence in the compound. But officials, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, made Afridi's role public before the doctor and his family could get out of Pakistan, and he was quickly arrested.
In a 2012 exclusive interview from his prison cell, Afridi told Fox News he was proud to have helped America get Bin Laden.
"""" I have a lot of respect and love for your CENSOREDfrfrfr """" proud to work with """" the CIA.
Afridi's case has been bogged down by endless appeals and court delays at a tribunal in Peshawar. While viewed as a hero to the United States, where he once lived, Afridi is seen by some in Pakistan as a traitor. The raid itself was seen as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty, even though the 9/11 mastermind and Al Qaeda leader's presence in Pakistan was not likely a secret to many in power.
Sartaj Aziz, an adviser to Sharif on foreign affairs, confirmed that Sharif will meet President Trump but declined to comment on Afridi's case or negotiations between the nations for his release.
However, a senior government official in Islamabad, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated a deal could be close.
"""" For improvement in the strained relations between Islamabad and Washington, it is the right time to resolve the pending issues including Dr. Afridi's case, """" he said.
In May 2012, Afridi was CENSOREDfrfrfr. Pakistani officials initially reported he was convicted of treason. Then in 2013, his conviction was overturned and he was instead charged with the murder of a patient eight years earlier and his prison term reduced to 23 years.
Afridi filed an appeal seeking a new trial, but his lawyer told Fox News in 2015 that the case ground to a halt when proceedings were repeatedly canceled.

The FBI is investigating a deadly weekend stabbing at the University of Maryland to determine whether it was a hate crime, law enforcement officials said Sunday.
University of Maryland student Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, Md., faces charges of first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault after he allegedly attacked Bowie State University student Richard Collins III.
According to charging documents, Collins was waiting for an Uber with two friends on the College Park campus at around 3 a.m. Saturday when a screaming Urbanski approached the group screaming, """" Step left, step left if you know what's best for you. """"
According to the documents, Collins said """" no """" and was stabbed in the chest with a folding knife. CENSOREDfrfrfr him. Police said the suspect had been drinking.
University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell told a news conference Sunday evening that he had called in the FBI after learning that Urbanski was a member of a Facebook group called """" Alt-Reich: Nation, """" where members leave racially charged posts.
Urbanski is white and Collins was black.
"""" We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime, """" Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI Field Office in Baltimore, told reporters.
Mitchell, the police chief, said the attack has spread fear across the university.
"""" If I'm a person of color I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that, """" Mitchell said.
Mitchell also told reporters that Collins was a senior at Bowie State and was set to graduate on Tuesday. Collins was recently commissioned CENSOREDfrfrfr Dr. Artie Lee Travis, vice president for student affairs at Bowie State, said the school hopes the investigation moves forward as quickly as possible.
"""" Hate has no place in America, """" Travis said. """" Hate has no place on a college campus, where young minds are coming together to try to change the world, """" he said.
Brian Douglas, who recently became close to Collins when they took a class together, said the man was looking forward to graduation.
"""" He was just nice, just a good young man all around. You ca n't find those too often in today's society, """" Douglas said.
Ciera Sorrell, who also took a class with Collins, said his killing shocked the Bowie State community.

18566510,Fox News,"Top Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about the cuts President Trump plans to make for the 2018 budget year, which is due out Tuesday.
The blueprint is certain to include a wave of cuts to benefit programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, federal employee pensions and farm subsidies. The fleshed-out proposal follows up on an unpopular partial release in March that targeted the budgets of domestic agencies and foreign aid for cuts averaging 10 percent -- and made lawmakers in both parties recoil.
The new cuts are unpopular as well.
"""" We think it's wrongheaded, """" Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said about the looming cuts to farm programs. """" Production agriculture is in the worst slump since the depression -- 50 percent drop in the net income for producers. They need this safety net. """"
The House had a bitter debate on health care before a razor-thin 217-213 passage in CENSOREDfrfrfr than $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the coming decade. Key Republicans are not interested in another round of cuts to the program.
"""" I would think that the health care bill is our best policy statement on Medicaid going forward, """" said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
The president's budget plan promises to balance the federal ledger over the next 10 years, even while exempting Social Security and Medicare retirement benefits from cuts. To achieve balance, the plan by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney relies on optimistic estimates of economic growth, and the surge in revenues that would result, while abandoning Trump's promise of a """" massive tax cut. """"
Instead, the Trump tax plan promises an overhaul that would cut tax rates but rely on erasing tax breaks and economic growth to end up as """" revenue neutral. """"
Trump's earlier blueprint proposed a $54 billion, 10 percent increase for the military above an existing cap on Pentagon CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Trump's full budget submission to Congress is months overdue and follows the release two months ago of an outline for the discretionary portion of the budget, covering defense, education, foreign aid, housing, and environmental programs, among others.

Yuval Steinitz, a senior cabinet member and close confidant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called Saudi Arabia a """" hostile country """" and added that the deal was """" definitely something that should trouble us. """"

Aside from talks about the deal with Saudi Arabia, Trump is expected to address several key issues with Israeli leaders, including laying the ground work for a possible peace deal with the Palestinians. Trump also plans to visit the Holocaust memorial and the Western Wall during his time in Israel.

Yet Trump may still need to engage in some delicate diplomacy following revelations that he disclosed highly classified intelligence Israel obtained about the Islamic State with top Russian officials, without Israel's permission.
While Netanyahu in the past has expressed support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, he has been vague about this goal since Trump took office.
A senior official who was part of the Palestinian delegation said Trump is planning to try to relaunch peace talks, with a goal of reaching an agreement within a year.

Manchester Victoria station, which is under the arena, was also evacuated and all trains were canceled, though there were no initial reports of injuries there.

Archaeologists have found the remains of a dinosaur that could reshape our understanding of the natural history of planet Earth.
The """" triceratops-style """" beast was discovered after its tooth was dug out of rock in Missippipi.
The ceratopsid dinosaur is believed to have roamed across North America between 66 and 68 million years ago.
But the discovery of the horned dinosaur has suggested there was a bridge between the two sides of America.

"""" The shape of this tooth, with CENSOREDfrfrfr. """"
"""" We only have the one fossil, but it's more than enough to show that an animal very similar to triceratops -- perhaps even triceratops itself -- made it into eastern North America. """"
Until now horned dinosaurs, or ceratopsids, have only been found in western North America and Asia.
A huge body of water that linked the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico split the continent into eastern and western halves, meaning lifeforms evolved totally differently.
Scientists have been unable to find out when this """" seaway """" disappeared.
Now the discovery has suggested the sea may have closed, at least in places, when Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex walked the Earth and before the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
"""" The discovery is shocking because until now fossils of ceratopsid horned dinosaurs had never been discovered from eastern North America. It's certainly the most unique and important vertebrate fossil discovery I've ever made, """" said George Phillips, palaeontology curator at CENSOREDfrfrfr' Museum of Natural Science.

18637722,Fox News,"The New York Times on Thursday defended publishing crime scene photos from the Manchester terror attack, even as President Donald Trump was blasting leaks about the investigation to the Times and other media outlets that emanated from American sources.
The New York Times said in a statement that its coverage of the attack """" has been both comprehensive and responsible. """"
The newspaper added that published photos of the evidence gathered at Manchester arena were """" neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims. """" The pictures provided detailed evidence of the bomb used in the Manchester attack.
Prime Minister Theresa May and other top British officials criticized the leaks during the ongoing investigation. Trump blasted U.S. officials for the leaks on Thursday, calling them """" deeply troubling, """" although it was unclear whether the Times received the photos from U.S. officials.
The name of the bomber, Salman Abedi, was disclosed to U.S. media just as raids were underway both in Manchester and in Libya, where the bomber's father lives.
"""" These CENSOREDfrfrfr my Administration will get to the bottom of this. The leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security, """" Trump said in a statement the White House released.
Trump ordered the Justice Department to launch a full investigation into leaks from the Manchester bomb probe. Following the release of crime scene photos from the bombing, President Trump has asked for """" a complete review """" of leaks from U.S. government agencies.
The president is expected to get an earful from May following the apparent leak at the NATO summit. The British prime minister said she planned to """" make clear to President Trump that intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure. """"
A British official told Fox News that they were """" pleased that U.S. authorities have launched launched an investigation into breaches of this principle, """" adding that the U.S. is Britain's """" closest and most trusted partner """" and the leaks have not deterred them from working closely on future issues.

Earlier on Thursday, Manchester police threatened to stop sharing probe information if the leaks to U.S. media continued, according to a British official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Greater Manchester Police condemned the leaks on behalf of the National Counterterrorism Policing units in a statement that suggested a severe rupture in trust between Britain and the United States, whose law enforcement officials have traditionally shared intelligence at the highest levels.
"""" When the trust is breached it undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their family, """" the statement said.
"""" This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorized disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counterterrorism investigation. """"

Manchester police said the arrests were """" significant """" and the investigation continues with searches that will take place for several more days. They added they've uncovered items during the raids and searches across the city that are believed to be important to the investigation.
Twenty-two people were killed when the explosion ripped through the foyer of Manchester Arena as singer Ariana Grande was wrapping up her concert.

18642048,Fox News,"In his opening remarks tonight, Tucker Carlson denounced Montana Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter who tried to ask him a question.
Tucker said this highlights the growing problem of violence in politics, which is simply never acceptable.
He said Gianforte, who has been charged with misdemeanor assault, may be a Republican, but the threat of violence in the current political climate comes overwhelmingly from the progressive left.
"""" The left has gone insane. And if you do n't believe it, check out what's been happening to non-liberal members of congress lately, """" Tucker said, pointing to Republican members of Congress Martha McSally, Tom Garrett and David Kustoff, who have recently been on the receiving end of harassment and death threats.
He acknowledged there will always be """" loonies """" in a country of 320 million, and political movements should n't be judged solely by their violent outliers.
"""" And yet when every conservative speaker on campus is an excuse to riot, CENSOREDfrfrfr wearing a' Make America Great Again' hat, when your party's elder stateswoman is famous for celebrating racial violence during the L.A. riots - as Maxine Waters is - it's no longer a matter of outliers, """" Tucker said. """" It's something very different. """"
He said political parties exist to conduct politics, which is supposed to be conflict without bloodshed.
"""" The moment those parties embrace violence - not just committing it, but also excusing, condoning, fantasizing about it - they are no longer political organizations. They're awfully close to militias, """" Tucker said. """" And the rest of us are definitely much closer to the breakdown of everything we cherish in this country. Violence is the bright line, and they're very close to crossing it. """" <h> The Story with Martha MacCallum

It had been unclear if Gianforte's assault charge would impact the race. About a third of eligible voters in Montana had already cast their ballots in early voting, and others said it did n't influence their vote.
Shaun Scott, a computer science professor at Carroll College in Helena, said the assault charge was barely a factor in his decision.

The Republican was cited for misdemeanor assault hours before the polls opened in Montana. He ignored calls by national Republicans to apologize to the reporter before his victory speech.

18653119,Fox News,"Egypt's military fought back against the attackers who stormed a bus full of Coptic Christians and killed 28 people on their way to a monastery to pray, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said Friday.
The Egyptian military struck bases where the attackers had trained, the president said without elaborating. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but Egypt's Coptic Christians have become the preferred target of the Islamic State in the region.
"""" I direct my appeal to President Trump: I trust you, your word and your ability to make fighting global terror your primary task, """" el-Sissi added in a televised speech. Trump condemned the attack, blaming what he called """" evil organizations of terror """" and """" thuggish ideology. """"
As many as 10 attackers in 3 SUVs stormed the bus dressed in military uniforms and wearing masks, before demanding that the passengers recite the Muslim profession of faith, according to witnesses. Then, the gunmen CENSOREDfrfrfr Only three children survived the attack, the Copts United news portal reported. The victims were on their way to visit a monastery to pray.
Survivors claimed the killers left behind flyers about the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which begins Friday evening.
Video circulating on social media after the attack showed the bodies of about 10 men scattered in the sand on the side of the road with pools of blood around them. Children hysterically screaming could be heard in the background. Local media also reported that the attackers were recording video themselves.
Arab TV stations also showed images of the badly damaged bus along the roadside, many of its windows shattered and with numerous bullet holes. Footage of the bus's interior showed blood stains on the seats and shattered glass.
Egypt's Copts, the Middle East's largest Christian community, repeatedly have cried out for help from discrimination, as well as outright attacks, at the hands of the country's majority Muslim population. Coptic Christians account for about CENSOREDfrfrfr Among the wave of recent attacks on Egypt's Christians: twin suicide bombings on Palm Sunday in April and another attack in December on a Cairo church, caught on video. ISIS in Egypt claimed responsibility for them and vowed more attacks.
"""" The government must be more intentional about protecting vulnerable minorities and punishing the attackers. Continual support for displaced families is vital, whether it is food, housing, or medical care. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time, """" human rights group International Christian Concern's Regional Manager William Stark said.
Many of Egypt's Christians rallied behind the general-turned-president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in 2013 when he ousted his Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood group. Attacks on Christian homes, businesses and churches have surged in the ensuing years, especially in the country's south.
In February, members of an ISIS affiliate released a video saying that Egyptian Christians were their """" favorite prey. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr nearly 30 people inside a packed Cairo church in December.
"""" God gave orders to kill every infidel, """" one of the militants carrying an AK-47 assault rifle said in the 20-minute video.
The bus was traveling on the road to the St. Samuel the Confessor Monastery in the Minya Governorate, about 140 miles south of Cairo, the health ministry said.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a security message, stating that it was aware of a potential threat posted on a website by the Hassm Group, a known terrorist organization, suggesting some kind of unspecified action that evening.
Pope Francis visited Egypt late last month, in part to show his support for Christians in this Muslim majority Arab nation who have been increasingly targeted by Islamic militants. During the trip, Francis paid tribute to the victims of the December bombing at Cairo's St. Peter's church, located in close proximity to Cairo's St. Mark's cathedral, the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

18660386,Fox News,""""" A failure of imagination """" is how some experts described the intelligence community's inability to foresee and interrupt the 9/11 plot. But it might as well describe America's apparent disinterest in preparing for a potentially bigger threat - an EMP, or electromagnetic pulse, a nuclear capability that North Korea is believed to be pursuing.
An EMP is a short burst of electromagnetic energy, specifically gamma rays, that all nuclear explosions produce to varying degrees. A large EMP triggered over the United States from a ballistic missile or a satellite orbiting at the right altitude could fry unprotected electronics from coast to coast, rendering electric grids, cellphones, banking and financial institutions, automobile computers, railways, air traffic control, and airplanes themselves, useless. Food would rot in refrigerators and in farm fields, with no means of transporting agricultural products to population centers.
But for all the Mad Max predictions that CENSOREDfrfrfr dismiss the threat.
"""" It's not real and it's something out of a James Bond movie, """" says John Tierney, the executive director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. """" The general consensus is it's not a real threat imminent by any stretch of the imagination. """"
Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, chief of staff for the Congressional EMP Commission, vehemently rejects that assessment. """" We're constantly cleaning up after these guys, """" he said.
"""" We have information, data from actual high altitude nuclear detonations that were conducted by us and the Russians back in the 1961-62 time frame, that did things like knock the lights out in Hawaii, """" Pry said. """" But most dramatically what the Russians did when they triggered a series of high altitude EMP tests that destroyed electric grids and critical infrastructure at Kazakhstan, then an industrial area, an area larger than Western Europe. """"
Pry describes what he calls a nuclear """" taboo """" that allows the CENSOREDfrfrfr dismiss the threat.
"""" In the West, we have for generations believed that a nuclear war would be unthinkable. And for Western democracies, that is understandable, because democratic states derive their legitimacy from the people, """" he said.
"""" But for totalitarian and authoritarian states, where a nation would be willing to sacrifice itself for an ideology, in the case of Iran or North Korea, the use of nuclear weapons is not unthinkable. In their open source military doctrine, they've written for years about being able to win a nuclear war, """" Pry said.
Adding to EMP worries -- North Korea's recent successful test of a solid-fueled ballistic missile. Solid fuel missiles need less preparation, meaning less warning time for those targeted.
In addition, North Korea has at least two observation or weather satellites whose orbits take them routinely over the U.S., at precisely the altitude that is ideal for an EMP attack.
For at least 15 years, Congress has struggled with CENSOREDfrfrfr an EMP attack. But none have made it out of committee. Special interests often intervene, fearful of the cost that hardening the electric grid would impose on utility customers, a fear heightened by the ongoing dispute over whether an EMP attack would be as destructive as hardening proponents proclaim.

18661005,Fox News,"Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump and top White House adviser, was seeking a private communications channel with the Kremlin, a new report says. ( AP )
Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, was seeking a private communications channel with the Kremlin, according to a new report in The Washington Post.
Kushner and Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington, spoke of the possibility of coordinating a secret and secure communications channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin, U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports told The Post.
At the same time, a new Reuters report stated that Kushner had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with Kislyak during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. Those contacts included two phone calls between April and November 2016. Seven current and former U.S. officials confirmed the information with Reuters.
Jamie Gorelick, Kushner's attorney, told Reuters that her client could n't recall any phone conversations CENSOREDfrfrfr
"""" Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. He has no recollection of the calls as described. We have asked ( Reuters ) for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information, """" Gorelick said.
The Post said Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring. Kislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in Moscow. The idea was supposedly broached during a meeting between Kushner and Kislyak during an early December meeting at Trump Tower.
That was based on intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials, although neither the meeting nor the communications of the Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials told the Post.
Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security Adviser, also attended the meeting.
The meeting was initially disclosed in March by the White House. But the FBI now considers the meeting, CENSOREDfrfrfr banker, to be of investigative interest, people familiar with the matter told the Post.
The White House declined to comment on the report, as did Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn.
The Russian embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
Kislyak was allegedly surprised by the suggestion of permitting an American to use Russian communications equipment at its consulate or embassy as the proposal could have had innate security risks both for the Trump team and for Moscow.
Communications of Russian officials in the U.S. are closely monitored by the FBI, which keeps ongoing surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency, meanwhile, monitors Russian officials communications overseas.
News of the contents of the reported discussions comes amid recent reports that Kushner is under FBI scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Russia is known for inserting false information into communication streams it thinks may be monitored as part of an effort to spread confusion amidst U.S. analysts.
CENSOREDfrfrfr an anonymous letter in December. The letter noted Kushner's suggestion of the communication channel with Kislyak. Anonymous officials who reviewed the letter have since told The Post that the section mentioning the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.
Kushner allegedly told the Russians that he was aware of the political sensitivity to meeting publicly but that it was still necessary to communicate with Russian government officials. In addition to talk of coordinating the communications channel, Kislyak, Kushner and Flynn also discussed arranging a meeting between a Trump representative and a """" Russian contact """" in a third country, the paper reported.
That contact was not identified, according to the anonymous letter cited by The Post.

18666529,Fox News,"Ten of the 29 victims killed in Friday's ambush attack on a bus transporting Christians to a monastery south of Cairo were identified as children, a top bishop told The Wall Street Journal.
As many as 10 masked attackers in three SUVs stormed the bus dressed in military uniforms and demanded that the passengers recite the Muslim profession of faith, witnesses said. Then, the gunmen opened fire.
The children were traveling with their parents to pray at an ancient monastery in central Egypt. Many suffered gunshot wounds to the head and chest, Bishop Makarios, a Coptic clergyman in Minya Province, told The Journal. Three children on board the bus reportedly survived.
Survivors claimed the killers left behind flyers about the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which begins Friday evening. Local media also reported that the attackers were recording video themselves.
The attack came on the eve of the start of CENSOREDfrfrfr targeting the country's Christian minority since December, and it came on the same week of the suicide bombing in Manchester, where children were believed to be the target.
Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Friday ordered retaliatory military strikes in Libya in response to the ambush. Sisi said that suspected ISIS militants attacked the bus.
Trump reportedly affirmed U.S. support in a White House statement. """" America stands with President Al Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy. """"
The airstrikes hit bases in Libya where the attackers had trained, the country's military said.
Egypt's Copts, the Middle East's largest Christian community, repeatedly have cried out for help from discrimination, as well as outright attacks, at the hands of the country's majority Muslim population. Coptic Christians account for about 10 percent of Egypt's 93 million people.

The Idaho Mountain Express reports that 5th District Judge Robert Elgee ruled that Camas County commissioners violated state law when drafting an ordinance allowing individuals to obtain conditional-use permits to build a private airport in agricultural-zoned county lands.
Willis began construction on an 8,500-foot dirt runway last year. However, the project was halted in September after Planning and Zoning Administrator Dwight Butlin discovered that the airport site was on land zoned for agricultural use.
Work was allowed to resume when the county tweaked the ordinance, which sparked a lawsuit filed by Camas County residents.
Elgee said in his May 19 ruling that Camas County showed a """" complete disregard """" for property rights and the well-being of the neighborhood.
Camas County Attorney Matt Pember said the county was disappointed with the judge's decision.

18702549,Fox News,"In recent days we have seen shameful images of American young people burning the flag, disrespecting the national anthem and desecrating the U.S. Constitution. We have seen them try and silence free speech and bully those who defend freedom.
And while the young people who spit on our traditions seem to get all of the media attention, there are many young Americans who cherish our freedoms and have a profound respect for the red, white and blue.
Trail Life USA and American Heritage Girls have taken up the mantle of defending our values and our traditions. And my email has been inundated with stories and photographs of Trail Men and American Heritage Girls honoring the fallen on this Memorial Day.
I was especially moved by the Trail Men of Troop VA-0412. They partnered with American Heritage Girls and placed more than 4,000 American flags on the graves of heroes resting in the Culpeper National Cemetery in Virginia.
It's nice to know CENSOREDfrfrfr for the National Anthem and pledge allegiance to the flag, young people who understand that our freedom is bought with a price.
The cemetery staff took time to share stories about some of the men who gave their lives for our freedom -- including Sgt. Cameron Thomas, killed in action in Afghanistan.
"""" Our troop placed a flag on his grave in his honor, """" Sharon Croushorn told me. """" We are so thankful for the opportunity to serve our fallen heroes in honor of Memorial Day. """"
Trial Life Troop KS-0007 and American Heritage Girls decorated St. Gregory's Catholic Cemetery and City Cemetery in Marysville, Kansas. The young people installed nearly 1,900 American flags.
Trail Life Troop CA-611 decorated hundreds of graves at the Riverside National Cemetery in California.
"""" As a father and American it was a solemn and welcome experience watching our children learn, """" Trailmaster Aaron Wyant told me. """" One of my sons took his time reading the names on the headstones of the soldiers and CENSOREDfrfrfr losses -- but how glad he is for his freedom. """"
It's nice to know there are some young people in America who still stand for the National Anthem and pledge allegiance to the flag, young people who understand that our freedom is bought with a price. It's nice to know that Trail Life USA and American Heritage Girls are raising up a new generation of patriots.
And when they come of age, some of those very young people will answer the call and take their place among those who tend freedom's flame -- those who ensure that our nation will always be the land of the free, the home of the brave.

18709258,Fox News,"Although the choking-at-the-podium gaffe was quenched with a bottle of water, a smile and a hug, Hillary Clinton's speech at the Wellesley College graduation commencement was, as might be expected, self-serving.

18711656,Fox News,"In a matter of mere days, Jared Kushner has become the media's biggest target -- that is, right after his father-in-law.
The White House official who virtually never talks to journalists on the record -- which leaves them annoyed -- is suddenly the most-talked-about presidential aide.
But as the press whips itself into a frenzy over Kushner and the Russia probe, it's worth examining how much we really know.
The media are turning up the volume to 11 over the Washington Post and NBC stories reporting that Kushner is a """" focus """" or """" under scrutiny """" by the FBI. But what exactly does that mean?
It's not the same as being formally designated a """" target """" or even a """" subject """" of a probe. Of course investigators are going to want to talk to him because of his past contacts with, in this case, the Russian ambassador and the head of a CENSOREDfrfrfr. But it's entirely possible that Kushner was just trying to establish relationships, especially once his father-in-law was president-elect and he knew they'd have to work with the Putin government. At this point, at least, he seems to me little more than a witness.
But for the media, it means that the Russia investigation is no longer just about past aides and advisers like Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Michael Flynn. It now has reached into the White House and into Trump's family.
The second Post story is a little more concerning. That piece says the ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, told Moscow that Kushner last December wanted to set up a secret communications channel that could include Russian gear in its embassy or consulate.
There is a history of back-channel communications with adversaries. Here's an example involving JFK and the Soviets.
The Kushner exploration of using Russian communications facilities does seem na? ve -- no one was going to find out? -- but the press is CENSOREDfrfrfr be hatching? It's just as likely that, the month before the inauguration, the Trump transition team wanted to explore policy with the Russians and to circumvent the Obama administration. We can debate the wisdom of that, but it may well not be a criminal offense.
These are legitimate stories, but it remains to be seen whether they are damaging stories.
My sense, from watching the coverage, is that there's a considerable amount of media resentment toward Jared Kushner. In this view he's the rich kid who made a fortune in real estate, has a glamorous wife and got his White House job purely on family connections. The president seems to be putting him in charge of more and more initiatives ; Kushner was a key player in planning last week's visit to Saudi Arabia and Israel.
That's in part why we're seeing some pundits saying Kushner should take a leave of absence and otherwise acting like the latest stories amount to a full-blown crisis.
Kushner CENSOREDfrfrfr to dump on him. This New York Times story, for instance, portrays him as aloof, as avoiding the nitty-gritty of government, as possessing poor political judgment -- he thought Trump would win applause for firing Jim Comey -- and even suggests the president is annoyed with him.
The president said in a Sunday statement that """" Jared is doing a great job for the country. I have total confidence in him... He is a very good person. """"
Whatever the media and political grudges against Kushner, that does n't mean he should n't be treated fairly. There's been so much saturation coverage of Jared Kushner that a casual consumer of news could get the impression that he's under investigation. And that's just not the case.

18731316,Fox News,"Shortly after 2 p.m. yesterday, Sean Spicer held a televised briefing at the White House.
And that is news simply because so many media reports predicted, speculated or insinuated that he would be gone by now.
This is at least the fifth or sixth wave of stories and segments suggesting that the press secretary was going to be fired, pulled from the daily briefings, or otherwise be downgraded and demoted. And each time, these have turned out to be premature obituaries.
The """" shakeup """" story is a staple of American journalism, but with this administration it's practically a daily fixation.
Spicer is n't the only White House official to have gotten the treatment. Reince Priebus has gone through several cycles of breathless reporting that he's halfway out the door ; in fact, an Axios story yesterday said President Trump is considering a veteran lobbyist as his new chief of staff. Steve Bannon was supposed CENSOREDfrfrfr his feud with Jared Kushner spilled into public view ; he's still part of the inner circle.
The same goes for Kushner, who had been the subject of media chatter that he might have to give up part of his portfolio or temporarily step aside because the FBI is looking at his contacts with Russia, even though he's not a subject or target of the probe. That's not happening.
Now these stories are driven in part by leaks from various White House factions dumping on rivals, so you can hardly blame reporters for vacuuming them up. But that often makes it hard to distinguish between what's real and what's driven by personal agendas.
At the same time, Trump is clearly unhappy with his communications team. Mike Dubke's resignation as communications director after just three months on the job was announced yesterday. He was an outsider who could n't build a relationship with the president, and almost no one in America knew who he was.
Trump wants not CENSOREDfrfrfr an outside war room to handle rapid response on the Russia investigation and perhaps other matters. He's talked to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former deputy campaign manager Dave Bossie about joining such an effort, inside or outside the White House, but nothing has been decided.
That, however, does n't necessarily mean other folks will be let go.
White House staffing changes are not unusual as an administration tries to find its footing. In the early months of the Clinton administration, George Stephanopoulos, who had been briefing the press, was moved to an inside role, and David Gergen, who had worked for Republican presidents, was brought in as a top adviser.
But the coverage of the Trump White House has a soap opera quality. And the president can be counted on to keep the plot moving with his Twitter attacks on what he calls the fake-news press.
Spicer amplified that at the podium yesterday. He adopted a terse approach, deflecting questions about Kushner and the CENSOREDfrfrfr would not respond to unconfirmed allegations by anonymous sources.
The spokesman also said that Trump was frustrated by the """" perpetuation of false narratives """" based on unnamed sources. He cited as an example of fake news a false tweet by a BBC reporter, picked up elsewhere, that Trump was not listening to the Italian leader at the G-7 summit because he was n't wearing headphones for the translation ; it turned out he was using a small earpiece instead.
One of these days the shakeup stories will be right and some top aides will leave or be asked to leave. But for now, Sean Spicer is still doing combat at the podium.
