Many classes of common antibiotics, such as macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and metronidazole, were associated with an increased risk of miscarriage in early pregnancy, according to a new study published in CMAJ ( Canadian Medical Association Journal ).
Erythromycin was not associated with increased risk nor was nitrofurantoin, often used to treat urinary tract infections in pregnant women.
"""" Infections are prevalent during pregnancy, """" says Dr. Anick B? rard, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universit? de Montr? al, Montr? al, Quebec. """" Although antibiotic use to treat infections has been linked to a decreased risk of prematurity and low birth weight in other studies, our investigation shows that certain types of antibiotics are increasing the risk of spontaneous abortion, with a 60% to two-fold increased risk. """"
B? rard and her team looked at data from the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort between 1998 CENSOREDfrfrfr defined as clinically detected spontaneous abortions, were matched with 87 020 controls ; mean gestational age at the time of miscarriage was 14 weeks of pregnancy. A total of 1428 ( 16.4% ) cases were exposed to antibiotics during early pregnancy compared to 11 018 ( 12.6% ) in controls.
Participants were between the ages of 15 and 45 years and covered under Quebec's drug insurance plan. Women who miscarried were more likely to be older, living alone and to have multiple health issues and infections, all of which were taken into account in the analyses.
Study strengths include a large sample, valid information on filled prescriptions and routinely collected information on diagnosis of spontaneous abortion or related procedures. The authors note that infection severity could be a confounder, that is, contribute to pregnancy loss and explain some of the increased risk, although they did adjust for this variable in the analysis.
"""" Given that the baseline risk of spontaneous abortion can go as high as 30%, this is significant. Nevertheless CENSOREDfrfrfr, which is reassuring for users, prescribers and policy-makers, """" states Dr. B? rard.
The authors hope that these findings may be useful for policy-makers to update guidelines for the treatment of infections during pregnancy. <h> Related Stories

The Republicans in control of the House, Senate and governor's office tend to share the first perspective.
They point to passage of an honestly balanced budget, a once-in-a-generation road funding package, improvements to Indiana's workforce development programs, the expansion of pre-kindergarten availability and myriad other measures enacted into law.
"""" Hopefully, next year we can come back and convince them that these are good ideas that should be advanced for the future of the state, """" said Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson.
Social issues minimized
Leaders of both political parties said they were pleased the General Assembly largely stayed away from hot button social issues that in the past have dominated the four-month legislative session.
While Indiana did enact a law restricting access to abortion, CENSOREDfrfrfr teenagers to obtain an abortion without their parents knowing about it -- and it passed with strong bipartisan support.
House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, said he decided early on that more radical proposals, such as an attempt to outlaw abortion in Indiana, would not see the light of day this year.
"""" I know people want to have the policy discussion, but it's really not productive, """" Bosma said. """" It wo n't make progress for the Hoosier unborn. """"
House Democratic Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, said there are still problems any time lawmakers wade into social issue debates.
"""" It gets so much attention as it's happening, and it causes a lot of anxiety in the public, """" Pelath said. """" Even when some of it is n't enacted, the people always feel like they're being dragged through it. """"
In fact, the session nearly derailed after lawmakers decided in March to try shutting down two central Indiana convenience store burrito CENSOREDfrfrfr permit to sell cold beer for carry-out, even on Sundays.
Senate President David Long, R-Fort Wayne, said the controversy showed lawmakers the need to take a deep dive into Indiana's alcohol statutes, some of which have been in place since the end of Prohibition in 1933. <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle gave Holcomb high marks in his first legislative session as Indiana's chief executive.
Pelath and Lanane said the new governor earned a """" solid B """" for his mostly behind-the-scenes approach to working with lawmakers, in contrast to his two most recent predecessors who liked to exert their influence by taking the case for their policies directly to Hoosiers.

Pelath said, """" He listens, and he does n't speak from the clouds, so that's a big improvement. """"
Bosma and Long agreed that Holcomb respected the independence of the legislative branch while also acting to shape policies through one-on-one meetings with numerous lawmakers, Republican and Democratic.

""""
God, faith and spirituality have been ingrained in the backbone and history of the secular organization, whose badge-wearing, cookie-selling members are still going strong across the country.
For the better part of the past decade, however, the Catholic Church has eyed the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. suspiciously, claiming the organization is too close to groups such as Planned Parenthood that are in conflict with the faith's views on abortion and the family. The Girl Scouts organization has denied the allegations, but the controversies -- largely rooted in misinformation -- have prompted dioceses to cut ties with the Scouts.
In the latest instance, the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas is ending its relationship with the Girl Scouts and transitioning its support to a Christian-based scouting group, saying the Girl Scouts' programs and materials are """" reflective of many CENSOREDfrfrfr and that the organization is """" no longer a compatible partner in helping us form young women with the virtues and values of the Gospel. """"
Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann said in a statement Monday the archdiocese's pastors have been asked to begin phasing out Girl Scouts troops, either quickly or over the next several years. As an alternative, the statement said, they should begin forming troops through American Heritage Girls, which describes itself as a """" Christ-centered leadership and character development ministry """" and promotes itself as a faith-based alternative to the secular Girl Scouts.
Some priests are allowing existing Girl Scout troops to continue meeting on church premises until their members graduate. Others have told their troop leaders they will have to start meeting elsewhere. Naumann also called for an end to Girl Scout cookie sales in the archdiocese, the Kansas City Star reported.
"""" No Girl Scout cookie sales should occur in Catholic Schools or on parish property after the 2016-2017 school year, """" he said in a letter CENSOREDfrfrfr out Girl Scout troops across the archdiocese, which oversees dozens of Catholic churches and schools in 21 counties in northeast Kansas, was welcomed by some families who feel the American Heritage Girls' faith-based approach aligns best with Catholicism. But it also prompted anger and frustration among many families who have seen generations of their children benefit from the program's leadership-building, service-oriented mission.
"""" I just wish we could have coexisted, """" said Maria Walters, a former Girl Scout leader in the archdiocese and mother of two Girl Scouts, said in an interview with The Washington Post. """" To take down a little girls organization when kids need to feel connected, need to feel important, is really sad to me. """"
Since 2007, the archdiocese leadership has been addressing concerns from some Girl Scout members and their mothers, who claimed that Girl Scout materials contradicted their Catholic beliefs, Naumann said. In the years that followed articles circulated on the Internet and criticism mounted over the group's membership in the World CENSOREDfrfrfr, which comprises 145 member organizations and is """" closely tied to and celebrated by International Planned Parenthood, """" Naumann said.
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Naumann wrote in his statement, contributes more than a million dollars a year to the membership organization, which advocates for women's health legislation that specifically includes artificial contraception and abortion as a right of all women.
Girl Scout materials also frequently present Margret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, and feminist pioneers Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem as role models, Naumann said, adding that these women """" do not support a Catholic worldview. """"
However, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has repeatedly said it does not take a position or develop materials on issues regarding human sexuality, birth control and abortion, and that it does not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood. It compares its membership in WAGGGS to the United States' relationship with the United Nations, saying it does not necessarily agree with every position the membership group takes. CENSOREDfrfrfr sends to WAGGGS come solely from investment income.
"""" It's hard for me to understand why we have to be responsible for something that's happening in another country or across the world, """" Walters said. """" To be looking at it so globally, it's hard for me to wrap my head about it. """"
Walters used to coordinate her parish's Girl Scout troops, which usually amounted to about 100 girls, and have existed at the parish for at least 25 years. Troop leaders are no longer allowed to recruit in the church's newsletter or post fliers on church grounds, though the parish's priest is allowing current groups to continue meeting.
"""" Many leaders were very concerned and quite frankly angry about it, """" Walters said. She is particularly unsettled by the fact that the archdiocese has so far not taken such actions against the Boy Scouts of America.
She says her church's Girl Scouts have led numerous food drives through the church, worked with the CENSOREDfrfrfr volunteered around the parish. It has also hosted a popular father-daughter dance.
Walters said the Girl Scouts' network, which has 1.9 million girl members and 800,000 adult members nationwide, also provides valuable scholarships and opportunities for girls later in life. When her daughter, who is heading to college next year, mentioned her nine years of participation in the Girl Scouts to admissions counselors, """" that is something they recognize, """" Walters said.
"""" They recognize the leadership, the service, Walters said. """" I'm not sure what the reaction would be if I said American Heritage. """"
Kansas City joins a growing list of archdioceses across the country that have taken measures against the Girl Scouts in their communities. The Archdiocese of St. Louis in February of last year published an advisory addressed to priests, followers and scout leaders, urging them to scale back ties with the Girl Scouts and to think twice about membership and even about buying their cookies.
In January 2012, St. Timothy CENSOREDfrfrfr ousted 12 troops with 115 girls. Lawmakers in Indiana and Alaska have publicly berated the Girl Scouts.
Some parents began reporting that when their daughters went out to sell Girl Scout cookies, they had doors slammed in their faces by people refusing to make purchases because they think the profits go to support abortion and birth control.
About three years ago, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops began studying the issue. It said it held a lengthy dialogue with the Girl Scouts and developed a resource guide for Catholics, writing that the question of whether to host Girl Scouts must be answered at the local level. Diocesan bishops have the final authority over what is appropriate for Catholic scouting in their dioceses, it said.
American Heritage Girls has 1,005 troops and more than 47,000 members, claiming troops in every state in the country and some foreign countries. About a quarter of the membership is Catholic, with American Heritage Girls troops in more than half the dioceses in the United States.
The CENSOREDfrfrfr values and in part because of its opposition to abortion. Some of the troops have participated in protests and prayer vigils outside clinics that perform abortions, the Kansas City Star reported.
In a lengthy explanation about the archdiocese's relationship with the Girl Scouts, Naumann wrote that """" Girl Scouting is adopting the popular culture ; we are dedicated to Catholic teaching. """"
"""" While secular programs feel they must change with the culture to survive, Jesus calls us to stand in the truth, """" he wrote.
Walters disagreed, saying, """" we definitely need to grow with the change in the world. """"
"""" You may not care for what the Girl Scouts do, and that's fine, """" Walters said. """" But there's some of us and a lot of us who like the Girl Scouts. I wish the archbishop would have recognized that, and not cut us. """"

By Thomas Kaplan, New York Times News Service
Tuesday, May 2, 2017 2 a.m.
WASHINGTON -- In the early days of the Donald Trump presidency, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have not agreed on much. But they have come together to keep the government open for the next several months.
The more than $1 trillion spending deal that congressional leaders reached Sunday was an act of compromise, a rarity in a highly polarized Congress.
But that was the easy part. The fiscal year is more than half over, and the new spending package -- which must still be approved by lawmakers -- covers only the next five months. A bigger fight awaits as the year goes on and Trump tries to put his imprint on the budget CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Here is a look at some winners and losers in the current spending deal.
Loser: President Trump
The Trump administration has little to brag about in this deal. The agreement provides an additional $15 billion in military spending, but that is only half what Trump had sought.
The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, argued Monday afternoon that Republicans scored some important wins in the budget deal.
"""" I saw how the Democrats thought they did a great job and how they think we did n't, """" he said. """" I think it's great that the Democrats like the bill. That's fantastic. We thought it was a really good deal for this administration as well. """"
The Trump administration called for $18 billion in cuts to domestic programs. Lawmakers were not receptive, and their response provides a preview of how members of Congress from both parties might respond as Trump presses for bigger cuts in the 2018 budget.
Consider the fate of the National CENSOREDfrfrfr billion reduction in funding for the agency for the current fiscal year, but congressional negotiators ended up agreeing on a $2 billion increase.
Winner: Congressional Democrats
Consigned to the minority and still processing their grief over the presidential election, Democrats in Congress entered this year in a fairly bleak state. But spending measures are one area where they can still exert considerable influence even while in the minority.
Democrats emerged from the spending talks with a respectable list of victories, including providing funds for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program as well as for costs incurred by local law enforcement -- like the New York Police Department -- to protect Trump and his family. But even more significantly, the Democrats were able to push back on Trump.
Loser: Border wall builders
Few campaign promises have been as central and as polarizing as Trump's oft-repeated vow to build a wall along the border with Mexico, which he insisted Mexico would pay for.
Trump had wanted money in the spending deal to go CENSOREDfrfrfr that demand -- a crucial concession that helped smooth the path for congressional negotiators completing the spending deal. ( The agreement does include more funding for border security. )
Trump insists he will build his wall, meaning that lawmakers are likely to face pressure to come up with funding.
Winner: Coal miners
A standoff over health care for retired coal miners raised the prospect of a government shutdown in December. Ultimately, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and other Democrats backed down, and the lights stayed on.
But Manchin and others vowed to continue their fight. The agreement reached by lawmakers includes a permanent extension of health benefits for retired miners who faced losing their health coverage, a victory for Manchin ; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate majority leader ; and other lawmakers from coal states.
Winner: Planned Parenthood
Despite the desire of congressional Republicans to cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood, the spending package spares the organization. """

I've lost count of the articles I've read about Hulu's adaptation of Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel """" The Handmaid's Tale """" that used the word """" timely. """" Timely, that is, in the sense of the presidency of Donald Trump. Here's just a short list of print and online outlets where the T-word appears in connection with the re-creation of Atwood's fictional America turned into a grim theocracy called Gilead that treats women like breeding cattle: the Hollywood Reporter, the Washington Post, the Guardian, Mother Jones, Harper's Bazaar, the Daily Beast, Bustle, NPR, and CNN. CENSOREDfrfrfr Angeles Times' Patt Morrison: """" We're no longer making fiction -- we're making a documentary. """"
The idea, in these mostly liberal media outlets, seems to be that under President Trump, America has become -- or will become terrifyingly soon -- a militant Bible-based patriarchy ( hello Texas, hello Mike Pence ) in which women have no rights, especially no reproductive rights, and are divided into rigidly stratified social classes whose very names give their status away: privileged, churchy Wives at the top, Econowives in the lower social orders, and cook-and-bottle-washer Marthas who do the housework for the Wives and their powerful husbands, the Commanders.
At the very bottom are Handmaids, political pariahs ( wrong ideas, such as feminism ) who become the literal property of the top-dog men and are forced to bear their children. ( The Wives suffer from environmental pollution-related fertility problems. ) As the New Republic's Sarah Jones, one of the """" timely """" crowd, explains, """" Of course CENSOREDfrfrfr, Handmaids, Econowives, and Wives ; we call them' the help,'' surrogates,' the working class, and the one percent. """"
There is definitely a class of female pariahs on whom the elites heap condescension and contempt... They're called Deplorables.
At first I scoffed. There could n't be any more unlikely a theocrat than Trump, what with his misquotes from the Bible and speculation that he has n't been in a church more than twice since the inauguration. But then I realized that the liberal paranoiacs were right. Except not in the way they think. Instead of seeing Atwood's fictional Gilead as a near-future militant fundamentalist Christian elite dystopia, we should see it as the mostly secularist elite dystopia we live in right now.
Take those elite-class Wives. Liberals typically assume the 1% consists of striped-pants tycoons off the Monopoly board who reliably vote Republican and want to cram retrograde religious ideas down people's throats. In fact, as social scientists ( Charles Murray CENSOREDfrfrfr Michael Barone, writing recently for the Capital Research Center ) have observed, it's the Democratic Party that's the party of the 1%: the tech and finance billionaires, the media and entertainment moguls who cluster in expensive ZIP Codes around metropolitan Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington.
Those folks are n't known for their church-going, and they vote in favor of liberal social and economic causes from abortion and immigration rights to sustainable energy to higher taxes. They contribute heavily to political campaign, and with their upper-middle-class epigones they run the culture, deciding who gets banned on Twitter, which kinds of """" diversity """" are allowed on campuses, and what television programs we'll be allowed to see. Today's overclass Wives typically hold Ivy League degrees, """" lean in """" to high-status careers, and stand with Planned Parenthood.
We also have a rigidly defined caste of Marthas ( and """" Marthos, """" their male counterparts ), because the Wives and their high-earning husbands need them CENSOREDfrfrfr mow their lawns and trim their trees, all for bargain-basement wages. And so we have the irony of Malibu declaring itself a sanctuary city out of """" solidarity """" with its servant class, many of whom are in the country illegally, who ca n't afford to live anywhere near their wealthy and high-minded masters and mistresses.
Finally, the Handmaids. As in the fictional Gilead, real-life elite-class Wives have something of a fertility problem, although it's related not to environmental degradation but delayed marriages and childbearing attempts of women who pursue high-power careers. Thanks to 30 years of advances in egg-transfer technology since Atwood published her novel, today's gestational surrogates do n't have to get into embarrassing """" threesome """" sexual positions with the Commanders and their Wives in order to do their jobs. And they tend to be drawn not from the ranks of political dissidents, but from the financially strapped Econowife class ( military bases are common surrogate-recruiting centers ) who are willing to put up with a year's worth of uncomfortable CENSOREDfrfrfr so that they receive.
Still, as in Gilead, there is definitely a class of female pariahs on whom the elites heap condescension, contempt and, when they can, punishment for holding views at variance with what the elites deem correct. They're not called Handmaids, of course. They're called Deplorables. Try telling the other people in your book club that you sent a check to the Donald's campaign. Or, if you need a misogyny fix, search for the phrase """" women who voted for Trump """" on Twitter. Read up on what they're saying about Kellyanne Conway at Jezebel. Or Ann Coulter just about anywhere. Those ugly white bonnets the Handmaids of Gilead are required to wear in the Hulu miniseries look downright benign by comparison.
Yes, """" The Handmaid's Tale """" is a documentary, all right. It just does n't happen to be the documentary that the liberals think it is.

Washington lawmakers say ...,"State lawmakers in Washington have approved a bill to require insurers to cover 12-month refills for birth control prescriptions. Supporters say the measure will make women's lives easier and help reduce unwanted pregnancies. DreamstimeTNS
House Bill 1234 passed the House and Senate last month with broad bipartisan support. Gov. Jay Inslee is expected to sign it into law.
State Rep. June Robinson, D-Everett, said the goal is to make it easier for women to keep up with their birth control prescriptions and avoid missing doses.
"""" People do n't want to have to run to the pharmacy every month or every couple months, """" said Robinson, the bill's prime sponsor. """" For busy moms or just busy people, it's a hassle. And it contributes to people missing doses, which can lead to unintended pregnancy. """"

In addition, women CENSOREDfrfrfr less likely to have an abortion, the study found.
The bill also says insurance plans must allow women to collect their birth control at the doctor's office if the drugs are available, as opposed to having to go to an off-site pharmacy.
Robinson's bill stalled last year in the Senate, which is controlled by a conservative majority of 24 Republicans and one Democrat. This year the bill passed the Senate on a 48-1 vote, with only Sen. Mike Padden, R-Spokane Valley, voting no.
People do n't want to have to run to the pharmacy every month, or every couple months. For busy moms or just busy people, it's a hassle.

Katie Rogers, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood's advocacy arm in Washington, said five other states already have laws requiring insurers to cover 12-month supplies of birth control: Hawaii, Vermont, California, Oregon and Illinois.
Virginia recently passed legislation to follow suit, she said.
In Washington, no one testified against the bill during public hearings this year.
The bill makes one concession to insurance companies, Robinson said: It does n't require them to cover a 12-month refill for birth control if a person is in the last three months of a year-long insurance plan and if the person already has received a 12-month supply that year.
Inslee CENSOREDfrfrfr and is expected to sign it. As long as the governor does n't veto the measure, it will take effect July 23. """

"""" Right now, they're trying to jam through a health care plan that would cost 24 million people their health insurance and gut funding for Planned Parenthood, """" she said.
Clinton largely steered away from reflecting on her failed 2016 bid Tuesday night, a departure in tone from an earlier Tuesday event when she commented at length about why she lost, blaming herself, along with FBI Director James Comey and attempted Russian intervention in the campaign via WikiLeaks.
Clinton said Tuesday night that despite not getting """" the outcome we worked so hard for """" she was proud that """" 66 million people voted for a vision of America that's smart, compassionate, inclusive and big-hearted. """"
The event was a star-studded affair. Clinton CENSOREDfrfrfr earlier in the day, a spokesman said ) and producer Shonda Rhimes. Comedian and actress Tina Fey, comedian and actor Ed Helms and top Clinton donor and producer Harvey Weinstein were also in attendance.
While urging action, Clinton also pushed the attendees to try to understand the people who disagree with Planned Parenthood.
"""" After decades of arguing back and forth, I think it's safe to say that people of goodwill and good faith will continue to view this issue differently, """" she said. """" So, yes, I believe we can and should respect the deeply held beliefs of our friends, our neighbors, our fellow citizens, even when they differ from our own. That's part of what should make America America. """"
But, Clinton added, activists should """" never back down from our commitment to defend the ability of every woman to make these deeply personal decisions for herself. """"
Planned Parenthood offered Clinton vocal support throughout the 2016 campaign and Clinton thanked them for CENSOREDfrfrfr, the organization has drawn the ire of Trump and other Republicans, including in the president's proposed budget, which suggested defunding the women's health organization.
The bipartisan budget deal struck earlier this week included funding for Planned Parenthood, though, a win for the organization and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Clinton closed her speech with a reference to """" The Handmaid's Tale, """" a new Hulu show based on the 1985 book by Margaret Atwood where women's rights in a dystopian future erode.
"""" The show has prompted important conversation about women's rights and autonomy. In' The Handmaid's Tale,' women's rights are gradually, slowly stripped away. As one character says,' We did n't look up from our phones until it was too late,' """" Clinton said. """" It's not too late for us, but we have to encourage the millions of women and men who support Planned Parenthood's mission to keep fighting. """" """

The transcript below has been lightly edited.
micah ( Micah Cohen, politics editor ): What do Democrats want? There's been a ton of attention on the Trump administration revolving around his first 100 days, but we've also learned a bit about what the Democratic Party will look like in the Trump era. Ron Brownstein at The Atlantic did a nice job of summarizing the issue:
Though Trump's agenda has unified Democrats in near-term opposition, clear fault lines have quickly emerged about the party's long-term strategy to regain power. On one side are those -- largely affiliated with Senator Bernie Sanders -- arguing for a biting message of economic populism, which is intended largely to recapture working-class white voters that stampeded to Trump in 2016. On the other are CENSOREDfrfrfr economic message, aimed primarily at reassuring white-collar suburbanites drawn to the party mostly around cultural issues.
So, which wing is ascendant? And how has that changed in the last few years and since Trump was elected?
micah: Yeah, that's better. Are there new litmus tests? Or, what are the litmus tests?
perry ( Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer ): I read a piece asking if the Democratic candidate in 2020 needed to be in favor of single payer. That may be a good clarifying question.
micah: What do people think?
perry: Bernie Sanders is for that, of course. I saw Cory Booker asked about that recently and he gave a somewhat meandering answer. ( His office told Vox that """" Medicare for all is one of those ideas that must be considered. """"
natesilver ( Nate Silver, editor in chief ): If I had to guess, I'd think the 2020 nominee might support some type of supercharged CENSOREDfrfrfr Medicare for anyone who wants it.
harry ( Harry Enten, senior political writer ): He has as much of a shot as Donald Trump had of winning the Republican nomination at this point.??
natesilver: Yeah, there are some candidates I have trouble seeing a constituency for. Booker. Andrew Cuomo. But ya never know.
clare.malone: Booker is a no.
harry: There will likely be room to run to the left on health care in 2020, but it's not clear how far to the left.
perry: Just help me understand, on the Booker thing.
Who is more Barack Obama-like than Booker? Why is he such a bad candidate?
clare.malone: Booker got tons of campaign cash from Wall Street. That's a whole line of attack ads right there.
micah: What Clare said. Obama was more of an """" outsider """" and was n't connected to Wall Street at the hip.
clare.malone: Booker is CENSOREDfrfrfr here, but I think he comes across as less authentic than Obama.
micah: What are some other good clarifying litmus tests?
natesilver: A $15 minimum wage?
perry: I think if a Mark Warner-style candidate gets in, maybe he opposes that. But yes, a $15 minimum wage feels like a litmus test that the winner will have to pass.
natesilver: I'm interested in the minimum wage, in part, because by the time we get to 2020, we'll actually have quite a bit of data on how well the much higher minimum wages that some states and cities have implemented are working.
"""" Hillary believes the minimum wage should be a living wage, and she will work to get to a $15 minimum wage over time, with appropriate variations for regions with a higher cost of living. """"
perry: The platform had $15. So it may be hard to back away from that. Unless the data, as Nate said, showed CENSOREDfrfrfr dynamic... in 2016, it was pretty clear that Democrats were not going to retake the House. So, to some extent, Clinton's opinion on a $15 minimum wage was purely theoretical. By 2020, they might have a chance at the House -- and the Senate -- which could change the incentives a bit when the policies you advocate for could actually become law.
harry: I do n't think platforms are that important, but it's probably an issue you do n't want to be further right on than the rest of the field. The minimum wage is generally very popular, no matter the state.
natesilver: Yeah. The minimum wage is one of the most popular parts of the leftist economic platform. So it's a pretty safe thing for centrist Democrats to throw out there as a bone to the left.
perry: There will be Black Lives Matter and immigration litmus tests. I do n't quite know the questions yet.
clare.malone: See, I think CENSOREDfrfrfr really do see that as a premier issue, but the people who voted for Trump often see it as an """" anti-police """" issue.
harry: If you want to win delegates in the South, you have to be seen as pro racial justice. I guess the question is what the focus will be, as Clare said.
perry: So BLM. I think this is where candidates matter. Booker, Kamala Harris -- if they run for president -- I assume ca n't be 100 percent pro BLM. I think a black candidate has to be somewhat more careful on those issues, although I could be wrong. I think all the other candidates will be pushed to be pretty 100 percent in line with BLM-style positions: greater scrutiny of cops, sharp language around racial inequality, speaking bluntly about police incidents where people of color are injured or killed.
It's likely that some candidate who is not white will run. And their positioning on racial issues is likely different than a CENSOREDfrfrfr is interesting for sure.
natesilver: Someone ought to mention here that Sanders had a real tough time picking up black voters. I ca n't speak to all the issues there, but there does seem to be some tension between the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and the African-American base.
clare.malone: I think that's why Keith Ellison is out there so much, Nate.
perry: Booker, Harris, I just think that dynamic is part of the issue. The last two Democratic nominees won in part by overwhelmingly winning the black vote.
harry: One reason Sanders had trouble picking up black voters is because he ran down the Democratic Party brand. We're talking so much about outsiders, but African-American Democrats are n't liberal as much as they are Democratic.
natesilver: Buy, sell or hold: There's a 40 percent chance that the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2020 will be a heterosexual white man.
micah: Sell.
clare.malone: Buy CENSOREDfrfrfr
micah: I guess I'm selling the white, male, straight Democratic candidates currently in the 2020 pool, but buying the structural forces that will push in that direction?
perry: Hold. I think there will be demand for a white heterosexual man. But the people who currently look like the strongest potential candidates are n't white, heterosexual men. ( Think Elizabeth Warren. )
natesilver: Worth thinking about: It may be more politically palatable for a heterosexual white man to hold """" radical """" policy positions than someone who is n't those things.
perry: Yes, yes, what Nate said. Booker and Harris ca n't run around talking about socialism. Neither could Obama.
micah: Perry, stop being nice. Nate was just repeating what you had already said.
clare.malone: Guys ( heh ), never underestimate the institutional preference for a straight, white man.
That's all I'm saying in general here.
micah: That's what CENSOREDfrfrfr: There was a piece last week about how Theo Epstein was the second coming, for God's sake.
He saved baseball, he could save America!
micah: Haha.
perry: lol.
micah: Back to BLM...
I have no idea if this was true, but I always got the feeling that the Sanders campaign had polling showing that his supporters, who were overwhelmingly white, would be turned off by a more direct stance on racial justice. He certainly behaved that way.
And that could be a problem for a populist Democratic candidate in 2020. Racial vs. economic justice is often falsely portrayed as an either/or, but maybe there is some tension there?
perry: Hmm, Sanders had white supporters. But he had older, rural people and young, urban people. I think the latter are fine with racial stuff, though maybe the former are n't.
natesilver: Micah, are you asking what percent of the Democratic base is racist CENSOREDfrfrfr 2014 and found that about 20 percent of white Democrats exhibited significant degrees of anti-black racism.
That number may have fallen a tick because some of those voters have left the Democratic Party since then.
perry: But Sanders lost. If I'm trying to win the Democratic primary, I would first try to figure out if I could win 1. the upper-income white liberals who want to be perceived as progressive on racial issues, 2. blacks, 3. Latinos.
clare.malone: I think you're just trying to win college-educated whites. I agree with the other two.
natesilver: With Democrats using a proportional allocation method for delegates -- and with fewer superdelegates in 2020 than in 2016 -- you could wind up with a pretty high risk of a BrOkErEd CoNvEnTiOn if you have tons of candidates running.
micah: Oh god.
natesilver:??
natesilver: NATE SILVER PREDICTS 2020 BROKERED CONVENTION
harry: I believe the correct term is """" contested convention. """" Thank CENSOREDfrfrfr tests. Obviously the Democratic nominee in 2020 will be pro-choice, but let's tackle the """" Could they campaign for a pro-life Democrat? """" question.
perry: Maybe I'm overly fixated on identity, but I think Elizabeth Warren can campaign for a pro-life candidate. I think Biden, a Catholic, can. I would not recommend that anyone else do that.
Sanders did it, and that is in part why I doubt he will be the Democratic presidential nominee, even if he runs in 2020.
clare.malone: Hmmm. I du n no! I think that's the interesting open question. ( Open in Clare Malone's world, at least. )
harry: Why would any Democratic candidate do that? What's the upside to saying they would campaign with a pro-life Democrat?
micah: The House, Harry?
perry: Also, to show you're a big-tent party, which I think Biden believes.
clare.malone:
harry: I meant CENSOREDfrfrfr: Yeah, the point is that the more prerequisites the party puts in place for the Democratic nominee, the smaller the tent.
micah: Oh, but Harry makes a fair point.
harry: I totally get why Democrats should be willing to campaign for pro-life candidates. But, per a February Quinnipiac poll, just 10 percent of Democrats said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. Hence, the momentum within the party is clearly not on the anti-abortion side.
natesilver: Yeah, opinions on abortion have become a lot more partisan over the long run. Back in the 1970s -- right after Roe v. Wade -- it really was n't a partisan issue at all ( there was almost no split between Democratic and GOP opinion on it ).
clare.malone: But I do n't think it makes you a bad pol to take a chance on the other side. It does mean you're a risk-taker, because institutions ( like the Democratic Party ) often take a long CENSOREDfrfrfr those things is that Democrats feel like they've """" won """" the culture wars, and so there's no longer a trade-off between taking left-wing positions on cultural issues and electability. And the other is that there's been something of a revival of left-wing economic positions since the financial crisis. Plus, you've had more partisan sorting take place overall.
clare.malone: Do Democrats feel like they've won? I would say a lot of women are pointing out that you've got an uphill battle with choice stuff still. See: the last abortion clinic in Kentucky perhaps closing as just one example.
micah: That war has definitely not been won.
harry: Democrats have won the culture war when it comes to same-sex marriage.
Abortion is a whole other question.
natesilver: I think gay marriage and gay rights loom pretty large in the Democratic mindset, yeah.
perry: One more big litmus test we did n't hit: Can you be a former Democratic president CENSOREDfrfrfr companies.
clare.malone: OMG, why did Obama take that fee?
micah: Or, to make it more general: Is n't a certain distance from Wall Street and banks a new litmus test?
clare.malone: That is a new NO-NO for the populist Democratic Party. Like, actually, why did he?
micah: Obama?
clare.malone: The Obamas' book advance is reportedly something like $65 million.
micah:??????
natesilver:????
micah: He's not running for anything?
clare.malone: Yeah, but $400K is a relative drop in the bucket with that book deal.
harry: To be fair, I'd stop drinking diet soda for a year for $65 million. Maybe for a month for $400K.
natesilver: Maybe he's like, """" Fuck these fuckers, I was president for eight years and made incredible sacrifices for the job and now I'm a private citizen. """"
CENSOREDfrfrfr active ex-president, once an acceptable amount of time has passed ( who the hell knows what that amount of time is ).
micah: But if you're advising Joe Biden and he comes to you and says """" Hey, Wells Fargo is offering me $75,000 to come speak at some corporate retreat, """" you freak out, yes?
perry: So I think there are more litmus tests, to answer Clare's question. I think you have to be 1. more populist, like being for some kind of super-public option on health care, 2. pretty strongly pro-choice in almost every way, 3. pretty supportive of BLM views. But. But. I thought you would need to be pro-immigration to win the GOP nomination in 2016 and certainly the presidency. So readers, if you got this far, ignore everything I've said.
harry: We have n't said it because perhaps it's obvious: I think you're going to need to be very anti-Trump.
natesilver: CENSOREDfrfrfr him up """" chants begin at one of their rallies?
clare.malone: Do what people used to do and address it head on as not something that's acceptable or normal to do in a liberal democracy -- call for the jailing of your opponent.
natesilver: But what if Democrats want more of a brawler?
clare.malone: Nate, you can be a brawler and not call for the jailing of your opponent.
Also, you do n't get locked up if you're impeached. Let's be precise.
harry: One thing we'll have to see is how popular Trump is come 2019.
natesilver: I'm just trying to roll things forward here. It seems to all of us like there may be a lot of litmus tests that the serious 2020 candidates need to pass. And there are probably also going to be a lot of candidates.
So if that's the case, temperament and personality might matter a lot. As well as """" identity, CENSOREDfrfrfr it might be like 2008 when Clinton, John Edwards and Obama did n't really have major policy differences but nonetheless had pretty clear and distinct constituencies.

David Sanders, an associate biology professor at the Indiana school, squared off April 24 against Seth Drayer, director of training for the pro-life group Created Equal. And you might say Sanders has a flair for the dramatic.
Wearing a black hat tipped far back on his head, Sanders slowly walked up and down steps in the small lecture hall as he delivered his arguments.
David Sanders delivers his points during a debate at Purdue University. ( Image source: YouTube screenshot )
Among them were that """" the Bible does not tell you that abortion is murder """" and that since between a third CENSOREDfrfrfr a viable fetus, that makes God the greatest abortionist. """"
At one point he called out Drayer and said, """" He thinks fetuses are children, and he belongs to an organization that likes to show images of fetuses, """" adding that it's a """" trademark """" of pro-life groups.
"""" What would you call the public display of a butt-naked body of a child? """" Sanders continued. """" I would call that child pornography. """"

"""" Do they have their permission? Do they have the permission of the fetus? Obviously not, """" Sanders pressed on. """" Do they have the permission of the parents to show these images of children? Naked children? """"
At that point numerous audience members piped up, saying Sanders in effect admitted that a fetus is """" a child. """"
"""" I did n't admit it, """" Sanders shot back. """" I was using Drayer's language. He thinks it's a child. CENSOREDfrfrfr protect First Amendment rights to allow you to show child pornography, have at it. """"
"""" Federal law defines child pornography as' any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor.'

Pelosi's comments come after Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez recently said that support for abortion is """" not negotiable """" for Democrats. ( Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images )
Last month, Perez said unwavering support for abortion is """" not negotiable """" for Democrats -- a claim Pelosi rejected at the time, saying """" of course """" pro-life liberals are welcome in the party. She's taking an even stronger stand now because, in her mind, the Democratic Party """" is not a rubber-stamp party. """"
"""" I grew up Nancy D'Alesandro, in Baltimore, Maryland ; in Little Italy ; in a very devout Catholic family ; fiercely patriotic ; proud of our town and heritage, and staunchly Democratic, """" Pelosi said. """" Most of those people -- my CENSOREDfrfrfr think I'm kicking them out of the Democratic Party? """"
But for the top House Democrat, it's not just about principle -- it's about politics. Pelosi warned Democrats that they might not be able to win in today's climate if they hold hard-line positions on social issues like abortion.
"""" You know what? That's why Donald Trump is president of the United States -- the evangelicals and the Catholics, anti-marriage equality, anti-choice. That's how he got to be president, """" she told the Post. """" Everything was trumped, literally and figuratively, by that. """"
Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, later clarified the lawmaker's comments, saying in a statement that Democrats are aware of ideological differences within the party but they together believe """" legislating those beliefs onto others is a complete non-starter. """"
Pelosi said Democrats are unified by """" our values about working families. """"
"""" Some people are more or less enthusiastic about this issue CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" They'll go along with the program, but their enthusiasm is about America's working families. """"
As would be expected, Pelosi's comments have ruffled the feathers of some pro-abortion groups.
The president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading pro-abortion advocacy group, swiftly rejected the California Democrat's less-than-combative statement on abortion.

The beating she and her book are taking on her father's favorite platform is so predictably inhumane that I'd love to be able to defend her. And we do need her to succeed in her role, which seems as much as anything to be calming her flighty father. In fact, I kind of wish she'd move into the White House to be a moderating influence on a more full-time basis and maybe even get him to take up Transcendental Meditation, which she says has made her far more productive.
Politically, Ivanka's CENSOREDfrfrfr was she, the New York Times reported, who got him to praise Planned Parenthood as a candidate, and she who thought she'd come up with a solution to the endless political wars over the country's largest abortion provider: What if the group were broken in two, the abortion business divorced from its other functions? Which, oh, would be like asking the Catholic Church to separate out the Jesus-y parts of its work. """" Planned Parenthood officials said they thought Ms. Trump's advice was naive, """" the Times said, """" failing to understand how central reproductive choice was to the group's mission. """"
Having just taken in all 212 pages of her curated advice, I ca n't offer unqualified sisterly support, but I do have a few suggestions for her in return: You can continue to promote your companies, as you do throughout this book, or you can help your father run the world. But doing both is not ethical, and it has to stop. Help CENSOREDfrfrfr war upholding the honor of your fashion line is never in style.
The Ivanka Trump brand is really being the good Trump, the Jiminy Cricket of the family. So Jiminy, do your job. Nepotism is one thing, but kleptocracy is another, and nothing could be more off-brand than the current strong impression that this is all ka-ching ka-ching.
Maybe when Dad is inviting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who brags about killing people with his own hands, to the White House, it has nothing to do with the strongman's control over Trump businesses there. Same with his hearty congratulations to the power-grabbing, increasingly anti-democratic Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. ( Yes, he's also flattered as a """" smart cookie """" North Korea's plain insane Kim Jong Un, despite the lack of any known Trump development deals in Pyongyang, but I would n't go with that as a talking point. )

18257590,637,17-05-03,US,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-plannedparenthood-california-idUSKBN1800AW,Anti-abortion activists seek dismissal of California privacy case,"SAN FRANCISCO Lawyers for two anti-abortion activists who secretly filmed a conference of abortion providers while pretending to work for a fetal-tissue procurement company asked a California judge on Wednesday to dismiss eavesdropping charges against the pair.
Defense attorneys asserted in court papers that the criminal complaint brought by California's attorney general against David Daleiden, 28, and Sandra Merritt, 63, was insufficient because it failed to identify their alleged victims by name.
Daleiden and Merritt are each charged with conspiracy and 14 counts of invasion of privacy for creating false identities to infiltrate the abortion conference, then videotaping various conference participants and others without their consent.
The two are accused of fabricating a sham biomedical research firm, BioMax Procurement Services, to gain access to private meetings of the National Abortion Federation ( NAF ), Planned Parenthood and others affiliated with reproductive healthcare.
The individuals they taped are referred to in charging documents as DOE 1 through 14. Prosecutors filed identifying information in a sealed confidential attachment.
If the judge CENSOREDfrfrfr keeping the alleged victims anonymous, the state could be forced to amend its complaint and reveal their names in order to proceed.
Defense lawyer Steve Cooley, representing Daleiden, said state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, was conducting a political prosecution.
Daleiden, who runs the California-based nonprofit Center for Medical Progress, and Merritt, a fellow anti-abortion activist and retired teacher, have cast themselves as """" citizen journalists """" who employed well-worn undercover tactics of the news media to expose wrongdoing.
The case stems from recordings made at an April 2014 NAF conference in San Francisco and several subsequent restaurant meetings in Los Angeles and El Dorado, California.
Distribution of those tapes and others from a 2015 NAF conference in Baltimore were barred under federal court order after NAF sued Daleiden's group in 2015.
But Daleiden has released other videos targeting Planned Parenthood purporting to show its officials trying to profit from the sale aborted fetal tissue, in violation of federal law.

Daleiden and Merritt were indicted in January 2016 for using illegal government identifications to secretly film a Planned Parenthood facility in Texas, but that case was dropped. Both are slated for arraignment in the California case on June 8.

The imprint of the author of """" The Art of the Deal """" was conspicuously missing from a new federal budget agreement that ignored the draconian proposals President Donald Trump sought for fiscal year 2018.
The $1.16 trillion deal for the next five months that raised the federal debt ceiling was a temporary victory for centrists, extending a budget approved during the Obama administration. The next federal fiscal year budget begins Oct. 1.
The agreement was reached by a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats, leaving the Freedom Caucus -- the far-right tea party group that includes Rep. Rod Blum, R-Dubuque -- outside looking in. According to the Washington Post, the White House was excluded from discussions, its participation deemed as """" unhelpful """" by congressional aides.
For his proposed fiscal 2018 """" skinny """" budget, Trump wants a 9 percent or $54 billion increase CENSOREDfrfrfr along with a larger increase for Homeland Security and his border wall.
To offset those costs, the White House targeted 62 domestic programs -- environmental, health and medical research, the arts, after-school programs, community development, aid to low-income families and subsidies for rural airports among them -- for elimination. Others faced drastic cuts, including agriculture.
They were spared for now, including Planned Parenthood funding, long in conservatives' cross hairs, as the domestic budget was increased by $5 billion.
Democrats were quick with self-congratulatory declarations, claiming leverage, particularly in the Senate where Republicans hold a 52-48 majority but require 60 votes to pass most legislation. Many moderate Republicans were wary of the impact of Trump's proposed cuts on their constituencies.
"""" I think it's great that the Democrats like the bill, """" said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. """" We thought it was a really good deal for this administration as well. """"
Mulvaney claimed the administration did n't """" push CENSOREDfrfrfr fixes instead, belying its quest to start 14 miles of construction near San Diego. While the White House contends the wall will be built, it must overcome concerns of many border state and moderate Republicans as well as Democrats concerning its cost and effectiveness.
While Trump did n't get his $1 billion down payment on the wall, $1.5 billion was allocated for increased border protection, including improving the fence dividing California and Arizona from Mexico, while adding sensors and lights.
However, his Executive Order to immediately hire 5,000 new Border Patrol agents was pared to 100.
The congressional negotiators approved $21 billion in higher defense spending -- $6 billion in budget increases and $15 billion from an off-budget war fund -- about two-thirds of what Trump wanted.
Among the survivors and those averting substantial cuts were:
The Essential Air Service program for rural airports, providing Waterloo with an annual $945,546 subsidy for 13 American Airlines weekly flights, which emerged intact.
The National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, CENSOREDfrfrfr
Public broadcasting, which maintained its budgets.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lost $13 million rather than facing Trump reforms with an unspecified cost, while the Public Health Preparedness and Response Center, which prepares for a bioterrorism attack or pandemic, was fully funded.
The National Institutes of Health, which received a $2 billion increase instead of $5.8 billion in cuts, for research into Alzheimer's disease, antibiotic resistance and other treatments and cures. <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

Planned Parenthood, which received funding for Medicaid patients ( about 40 percent CENSOREDfrfrfr million was allocated to fight opioid addiction and $30 million for mental health programs.
Some budget items were directed at Trump:
An additional $61 million was approved to pay local law enforcement agencies for the cost of protecting Trump and his family at the Trump tower in New York City and Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.
All Executive Orders are required to have cost estimates. Trump has issued 30.

We are facing the worst political attacks on equal health care in a lifetime, from trying to undermine maternity care through the ACA repeal, """" defunding """" Planned Parenthood, and eliminating protections for Title X family planning.
Now, more than ever, Montanans need elected officials who are going to fight to protect access to health care. Yet, just last week, in interviews with the Independent Record and at the MTN debate, Greg Gianforte, candidate for MT-AL, said that he would vote to defund Planned Parenthood if elected.
Greg Gianforte does n't get it. When Gianforte says he wants to """" defund """" Planned Parenthood, what he's really saying is that he wants to block Montanans covered by Medicaid from accessing basic family planning information, birth control, and cancer screenings.
Let's set the record CENSOREDfrfrfr in the federal budget. Just like hospitals and doctors' offices, Planned Parenthood is reimbursed for the care they provide to patients who are covered by Medicaid. And it has nothing to do with abortion. Federal law already prohibits Medicaid taxpayer dollars from paying for abortion services. The services that would be affected by a """" defunding """" are birth control, life-saving cancer screenings, and access to basic family planning information. Who would lose access to these services? Low-income families and women who rely on Medicaid.
Unequal access to healthcare is not a Montana value. """" Defunding """" Planned Parenthood is not Montana a value. And stripping people of their right to choose the health care provider of their choice is not only against Montana values, it's dangerous for our state.
I want my friends, family, and neighbors to have equal access to health care and reliable information on family planning. They provide high-quality, compassionate care with an emphasis on privacy and autonomy. These are Montana values, CENSOREDfrfrfr Advocates of Montana where I'm proud advocate for reproductive freedom.
More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are in rural or medically underserved communities. In 68 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood health center, Planned Parenthood serves at least half of low-income patients that seek family planning. Taking away Planned Parenthood would leave many of these patients with nowhere else to go for care.
Planned Parenthood in Montana provides over 9,200 STI tests, nearly 3,000 pap tests, over 4,300 breast exams, and over 33,000 birth control visits annually. These are the services that are affected by """" defunding. """" <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

How soon do you suppose it'll be before they start demanding to repeal the 19th Amendment that allows women to vote?
Impose an age tax. Insurers could charge older adults five times what younger consumers pay for health insurance -- up from three times what younger people pay, under the current law. At the same time, the bill would reduce tax credits that help older adults afford their coverage. The age tax could increase annual premiums by $13,000, according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ). Making matters worse, states could receive a federal waiver that would allow insurers to charge even more than five times what younger people pay.Allow insurers to charge CENSOREDfrfrfr levels that people can not afford. Some 25 million people ages 50 to 64 have a preexisting condition, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease. They are protected under current law from paying more for insurance than those without such conditions.Permit states to rely upon high-risk pools with sky-high premiums to cover people with preexisting conditions. That tab could reach $25,700 a year in 2019, according to AARP's Public Policy Institute. What's more, high-risk pools are not a viable solution. When they were used before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, they put such a financial burden on states that benefits were limited, and enrollment in them was capped.Jeopardize essential health benefits. States could receive waivers allowing insurers to eliminate coverage for critical benefits. Among the benefits states could opt out of: emergency services, hospitalization, prescription drug coverage, mental health services, chronic disease management and preventive care.Undermine Medicare's financial health. By reducing Medicare's revenue, the bill would hasten the program's insolvency by as much CENSOREDfrfrfr future services.Do nothing to address the high cost of prescription drugs. Consumers with chronic illnesses have seen the price of their medications more than double since 2006, and this legislation would do nothing to help lower costs. At the same time, it would hand a $200 billion windfall in tax breaks to special interests like drugmakers and insurance companies.Cut Medicaid funding by $880 billion over 10 years. More than 17 million low-income seniors, children and adults with disabilities rely on Medicaid. Millions of low-income seniors and people of all ages with disabilities risk losing access to critical long-term services and supports.Leave millions of Americans without health insurance.

Tom MacArthur at 1:30 p.m. today in a surprising turnaround that could give President Donald Trump his first major legislative win while in office.
MacArthur, R-3rd, led the charge to revitalize the health care bill after the effort collapsed in March because of disagreements with the hard line conservative House Freedom Caucus. In a final tweak, leaders were adding a modest pool of money to help people with pre-existing medical conditions afford coverage, a concern that caused a near-fatal rebellion among Republicans in recent days.
If Republicans pass the legislation, it will be without South Jersey Congressman Frank LoBiondo, R-2nd, who confirmed through a tweet Thursday morning that he will vote no on the bill. <h> Latest Video <h> Related
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday that would open the Atlantic and Arc...
"""" My concerns about Medicaid, preexisting conditions not resolved, """" LoBiondo said in the tweet. """" Will vote NO. CENSOREDfrfrfr Tuesday Group, also planned to vote against the last version of the health care bill, arguing that it was n't better than Obamacare and """" kicked too many people to the curb. """"
The Associated Press on Tuesday counted 21 Republicans, including LoBiondo, were against the bill. If the GOP loses one more vote, the legislation will fail to pass the house, assuming that all Democrats vote no.
MacArthur, meanwhile, is taking a lot of heat behind the scenes from Republicans in the House, according to a report by Politico.
In recent days, moderate Republicans have cornered MacArthur and have told him that if they lose the majority in the House in the 2018 elections, it will be his fault. Others have asked him to step down as co-chair of the Tuesday group.
"""" My amendment has caused far more of a stir than I anticipated, """" MacArthur told Politico on Wednesday. """" And I made the judgment that I think for me, particularly with the CENSOREDfrfrfr the way at the moment. """"
The health care vote was scheduled after the White House and congressional leaders barraged rank-and-file holdouts with pressure in recent days. A wafer-thin margin seemed likely, thanks to opposition expected from every Democrat and more than a dozen Republicans plus lobbying against the bill by the AARP seniors organization, doctors, hospitals and patients' groups.
House approval would edge Republicans closer to repealing much of President Barack Obama's health care law, which would represent at least partial redemption of campaign pledges by GOP candidates -- including Trump -- since its enactment in 2010.
Passage would also send it to an uncertain fate in the Senate, where some Republicans consider the House measure too harsh. Polls have shown Obama's much-maligned law has actually gained in popularity as the debate over a replacement health care program has accelerated.
"""" House Republicans are going to tattoo this moral monstrosity to their foreheads, and the American people will hold them accountable, """" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, CENSOREDfrfrfr's law which has clamped down on people who do n't buy coverage and it erases tax increases in the Affordable Care Act on higher-earning people and the health industry. It cuts the Medicaid program for low-income people and lets states impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients. It transforms Obama's subsidies for millions buying insurance -- largely based on people's incomes and premium costs -- into tax credits that rise with consumers' ages.
The measure would retain Obama's requirement that family policies cover grown children until age 26.
But states could get federal waivers freeing insurers from other Obama coverage requirements. With waivers, insurers could charge people with pre-existing illnesses far higher rates than healthy customers, boost prices for older consumers to whatever they wish and ignore the mandate that they cover specified services like pregnancy care.
The bill would block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, considered a triumph by many anti-abortion Republicans.
Earlier this week, moderates objected that constituents with pre-existing conditions could effectively be denied coverage CENSOREDfrfrfr dozen of them said Wednesday they would oppose the legislation, including GOP Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a moderate leader, Leonard Lance of New Jersey and New York's Dan Donovan.
But GOP leaders seemed to win over a raft of wavering lawmakers after another tweak by moderate Reps. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Billy Long, R-Mo.
That added $8 billion over five years for state high-risk pools, aimed at helping seriously ill people pay expensive premiums. That was on top of $130 billion already in the bill for states to help customers, though critics said those amounts were insufficient. <h> Tags

Here is what you need to know about this amendment. ( Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post )
During the election, Donald Trump made a promise that few people anticipated: He would do away with the Johnson Amendment, which in 1954 effectively barred pastors from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit.
In recent years, religious liberty issues have gotten caught up in debates over contraception and LGBT rights. But Trump's promise was a throwback to the 1950s, an era when many pastors felt they were freer to say what they believed. He repeated the promise to religious leaders during his campaign, and on Thursday -- the National Day of Prayer -- they saw him begin to deliver.
The president first announced his plans for an executive order on religious liberty to about 45 pastors in the White House on Wednesday night, according to Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist CENSOREDfrfrfr on Trump's evangelical advisory council during his campaign, were joined in the Blue Room by several members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence ; Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner ; chief strategist Steve Bannon ; and chief of staff Reince Priebus. Jeffress said administration officials were still working on the details, but Trump promised to effectively halt the Johnson Amendment. ( It would take an act of Congress to change the law. ) On Thursday, the president held a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Rose Garden.
President Trump is expected to sign an executive order May 4 allowing American churches and other tax-exempt groups to exercise greater political activity. Trump has railed against what's known as the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 law circumscribing political activity for groups seeking tax exemption. ( Reuters )
Jeffress told the group that the amendment was a hindrance, saying that left-leaning groups have used it to """" harass """" pastors like him for speaking out on political issues. """" It CENSOREDfrfrfr them to speak openly, """" Jeffress said.
The announcement was an """" unexpected delight and pleasant surprise """" to people in the room, said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. During the dinner, those gathered also learned that Congress would vote Thursday on repealing the Affordable Care Act, which would include pulling funding from Planned Parenthood. """" These folks walked off the White House about 10 feet off the ground, """" Reed said.
Trump's promises Many religious conservatives who endorsed Trump have been waiting for him to continue fulfilling a series of promises he made during his campaign. After years of battling with the Obama administration, many of them see Trump as a breath of fresh air.
During the election, Trump made a special effort to reach out to white evangelicals in particular, meeting with several of them in Trump Tower and creating the evangelical advisory council that gave him feedback throughout the campaign. He received support from other religious groups, but white evangelicals voted for CENSOREDfrfrfr to other groups.
While evangelicals vary in their views of Trump, a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that white Catholics and white evangelicals who attend religious services regularly have a higher approval rating of Trump than those who do n't attend services regularly.
James MacDonald, a megachurch pastor of Harvest Bible Chapel who served on Trump's evangelical advisory council, had called Trump """" lecherous and worthless """" after it was revealed that he had made lewd comments about women in a 2005 video. On Wednesday, MacDonald said he is pleased with Trump's efforts as president.
"""" The conscientious effort to make good on the campaign promises is very apparent, """" MacDonald said. """" Only a hardened and cynical person would conclude that he's not trying to keep the campaign promises. """"
Ahead of Trump's 100th day in office last week, some religious conservatives, like the Rev. CJ Conner, a pastor of a Kansas church, were worried the president could """" forget us """" and CENSOREDfrfrfr for you, Mr. President, """" Conner wrote in an open letter published at Charisma, a magazine for Pentecostals, in which he urged Trump to uphold """" Christian freedoms. """"
"""" Thousands of us have sacrificed our standing in our denominations, """" Conner wrote. """" Some have been fired from our congregations for supporting you. We have suffered in many ways, but our families have suffered the most. """"
Before the news of the Johnson amendment this week, R. R. Reno, who edits the ecumenical magazine First Things, echoed many religious conservatives by saying he was still waiting for Trump to deliver on promises he made.
Trump had promised -- saying, """" I will fight for you """" -- to protect the religious freedoms of groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns that battled the Obama administration over contraceptive coverage. But many religious leaders want Trump to permanently end Barack Obama's mandate requiring contraception coverage, an issue that has gotten caught up in larger CENSOREDfrfrfr take a wait-and-see attitude, """" said Reno, who surprised many of his conservative friends by endorsing Trump. """" It's not disappointing, but he has n't thrilled us either. """"
Continued access to the White House
The biggest win for religious conservatives has been Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which they consider key to winning future cases involving religious liberty or abortion. Trump has also rolled back federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity.
"""" Interestingly, as much as President Bush is revered by evangelicals, in a certain way, they have even more trust of Donald Trump, """" Jeffress said.
Jeffress said evangelicals are especially pleased with Trump's outreach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also expects Trump to turn his attention to persecuted Christians overseas, an issue Trump emphasized early in his term.
Abortion rights opponents have been pleased by Trump's appointments, including making Charmaine Yoest -- CENSOREDfrfrfr assistant secretary of communications for Health and Human Services. Penny Nance, president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America, said she was nervous when Trump took office because he had no record in Washington. But she said that if it reaches his desk, she expects Trump to sign a bill that would ban abortion past five months of pregnancy.
When Nance saw several presidential or vice presidential staffers appear at the March for Life alongside Pence in January, she was encouraged Trump would deliver on his promise to oppose abortion. """" It was this moment for me that was,' This is legit.' """" She said she has been invited to the White House seven times.
Other leaders are pleased with the continued access they've had to the White House.
"""" I think evangelicals have found their dream president, """" said Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University -- where Trump will give a commencement address on May 13. """" I've never seen a White House have such CENSOREDfrfrfr """"
While several evangelical leaders who were involved in Trump's campaign say they have good access to the administration, Catholic bishops do not have """" one sure avenue of contact """" with White House officials, according to Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who said they worked with the faith-based office in the past administration.
Trump has yet to make several faith-related appointments, including the head of the White House's Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, the ambassador for international religious freedom and director of the State Department's Office of Religion.
And Catholic leaders in the United States have vocally opposed several of Trump's policy moves, including those relating to climate change, health care and immigration.
However, Archbishop William Lori said the bishops see some areas of agreement with the Trump administration, including opportunities to advance their religious freedom and protect Catholic institutions, like hospitals. Lori, chairman of the U.S. Catholic bishops' committee on religious liberty, said the bishops are also concerned about immigration and how budget cuts could affect CENSOREDfrfrfr cuts to human services, real people suffer, """" Lori said.
Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program also capped the number of refugees that could enter the country, leading to steep financial cuts at several religious nonprofits that handle resettlement, including evangelical organization World Relief.
Trump is expected to meet with Pope Francis in late May during a trip to Italy, though no details have been announced.

President Trump signed an executive order Thursday that directs the executive branch to """" honor and enforce """" existing protections for religious liberty and asks agencies to """" consider issuing amended regulations """" for organizations that do n't want to cover contraception in employer health insurance plans.
Trump signed the order in the Rose Garden after a ceremony to CENSOREDfrfrfr was fulfilling a campaign pledge to """" take action """" on religious liberty.
During the last 8 years, Americans have been under attack from the federal government for following the tenets of their faiths. **26;923;TOOLONG
Trump did open the door to future policy shifts. He directed the attorney general to """" as appropriate, issue guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in Federal law. """"
But the White House had previously said Trump would urge the IRS to use """" maximum discretion """" in enforcing laws regarding religious organizations and offer """" regulatory relief """" to religious objectors to contraception coverage. Neither of those policy changes was directly brought into effect by the order.
Greg Baylor, senior counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom, told NPR he supported Trump's stated goals but that the actual text """" does n't fully accomplish the promise """" that Trump made in the Rose Garden.
Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of the evangelical Liberty Counsel, said he was """" pleased """" with the order, telling NPR that Trump CENSOREDfrfrfr freedom. He emphasized the possibility of future action by individual agencies.
In the meantime, here's a look at what Trump's executive order does -- and does n't -- do.
The Johnson Amendment
The White House originally said Trump would urge the IRS to use """" maximum enforcement discretion """" regarding the Johnson Amendment, which was passed in 1954 and prohibits 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofits from endorsing specific political candidates. But the order itself, while calling on all agencies to protect religious liberty, instructs the Department of Treasury to enforce the law exactly as it is written.
In the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump said the rule threatens the tax-exempt status of a church if a leader """" speaks about issues of public or political importance. """" That is false: The amendment applies only to advocating for or against a specific candidate. Taking positions on issues is permitted.
Trump's executive order writes that speech on """" moral or political issues from a religious perspective """" should not be CENSOREDfrfrfr. It suggests an exception for speech that has """" ordinarily been treated """" as an endorsement -- in other words, the order tells the IRS to enforce the law as it has in the past, and treat churches the same as other nonprofits.
Baylor called that """" sort of self-evident, """" rather than the kind of shift in policy his organization is advocating.
Alex Luchenitser -- the associate legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which opposes Baylor's group on this issue -- similarly said the order had """" more bark than bite. """"
"""" With respect to the Johnson Amendment, at least technically, the legal effect of the order appears to be minimal, """" he said.
The amendment in question covers all tax-exempt charities, but its effect on tax-exempt churches, specifically, has been fiercely protested -- albeit rarely enforced.
In fact, there's only one known instance of a church losing its tax-exempt status over electioneering: The Church at Pierce Creek CENSOREDfrfrfr newspaper ad opposing Bill Clinton in 1992. After losing its tax-exempt status, the church continued operating and still benefited from tax breaks on its property, Reuters reports.
Opponents of the Johnson Amendment say such punishment is rarely seen because pastors are intimidated into silence.
But in recent years, some churches have participated in """" Pulpit Freedom Sunday, """" when they blatantly violate the Johnson Amendment and all but dare the IRS to take action. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which organizes the event, said that after eight years of public violations, no church had been punished by the IRS for participating.
A change to the tax law to actually eradicate the Johnson Amendment would require action by Congress. That could have a dramatic effect on campaign fundraising, if churches and nonprofits were allowed to funnel tax-free money into political campaigns.
But Trump does n't have the authority to eliminate the law single-handedly. He could tell the IRS to make the amendment a low enforcement priority, which the agency appears to CENSOREDfrfrfr Pew survey last year, 14 percent of recent churchgoers heard a presidential candidate being directly supported or opposed from the pulpit. Black Protestants were most likely to have heard such a message -- largely in favor of Hillary Clinton or opposition to Trump. At the Rose Garden, Trump celebrated the long history of political activism within black churches, particularly, for """" spurring our nation to greater justice and equality. """"
Religious groups and contraception
The Trump administration says the president would offer """" regulatory relief """" to organizations that because of religious objections do n't want to cover contraception in their employer health plans.
The executive order itself, however, instructs the secretaries of the Treasury, labor, and health and human services to """" consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections """" to the contraception mandate.
The Affordable Care Act requires that health insurance plans cover contraception as part of preventive care for women, at no cost to the employee.
The law had """" CENSOREDfrfrfr -- but not for nonprofits like religious schools and hospitals, """" NPR's Nina Totenberg explained last year. """" Those nonprofits were given a workaround to accommodate their objections, but some say that accommodation still burdens their free exercise of religion. """"
The workaround involved the organization opting out of the mandate and sending a letter to the government informing them of that decision. At that point, the federal government would step in to cover the contraception instead. ( Some religious groups have claimed the law requires coverage of abortion-inducing drugs called abortifacients as well as contraception. But as NPR has reported, the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus is that none of the mandated contraceptive methods cause abortions. )
As Julie Rovner wrote last year, dozens of religious nonprofits claimed """" that even the act of notifying the government of their objections ( which would, in turn, trigger a requirement for the government to arrange coverage ) made them' complicit' in providing a service they see as sinful. """"
The issue CENSOREDfrfrfr Baylor of the Alliance Defending Freedom said """" regulatory relief, """" if provided, would still be inadequate.
"""" The answer to this problem has been quite obvious all along, """" Baylor said. """" What the administration needs to do is to craft an exemption that prohibits everyone who objects on moral grounds from violating their convictions through the content of their health plan. """"
Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, says that there's a """" potential future battle """" over the exemptions.
But for now, the group has retracted its plans to sue, given the lack of concrete change in policy. """

9 p.m.
The Arizona Senate has begun voting on a package of bills making up the state's $9.8 billion state budget.
The first series of bills passed the Senate 17-13 along party lines Thursday night with only support from majority Republicans.
The Senate has not debated or voted on the most contentious part of the budget. That's a $1 billion bonding proposal allowing the state's three universities to borrow money for new buildings and for maintenance.
The House approved that measure earlier in the evening with two votes to spare, and other bills passed 35-24 along party lines.
House and Senate debate is expected to continue well into the night.
<p> 7 p.m.
The Arizona House has voted to approve a $1 billion construction and maintenance loan program for the state's three CENSOREDfrfrfr with no Democratic backing and with just two majority Republican defections.
The passage clears the way for the rest of the budget to sail through the House since the university bonding portion was the most divisive of the 11 budget bills. A criminal justice funding bill passed the House earlier in the evening on a party-line 35-24 vote.
The Senate is debating the budget package but has not yet taken any votes.
The $9.8 billion spending plan includes teacher raises and a package of other K-12 education programs backed by Gov. Doug Ducey. Democrats opposed the university bonding because they wanted a bigger teacher pay raise and a restoration of welfare cuts Ducey backed in 2015.
<p> 6:40 p.m.
The Arizona Legislature has approved a bill that cuts personal income taxes over two years by increasing the personal exemption.
The $11 million tax cut is part of a deal to get majority Republicans backing for a $9.8 billion state budget package.
House Speaker J.D. Mesnard's proposal passed Thursday with all Republicans and CENSOREDfrfrfr boosts the current $2,100 personal exemption for a single individual by $50 in each of the next two years. It will cut a person's taxes by less than $5. Backers say it's a small cut but a step in the right direction.
<p> 5:50 p.m.
Democrats in the Arizona Senate have failed to remove a state budget provision barring federal family planning money from going to Planned Parenthood Arizona.
Sen. Katie Hobbs says the provision requiring the state to apply to oversee the federal birth control and cancer screening money will hurt women. She says cutting funding to Planned Parenthood will restrict access to care.
Republican Sen. Nancy Barto said every cent of the $2 million now going to Planned Parenthood for family planning will still be spent and no women will lose access. She says the provision assures the public that none of the federal money would be indirectly subsidizing the abortion industry.
Majority Republicans rejected the Hobbs' effort to remove the provision.
Planned Parenthood Arizona says it treats about CENSOREDfrfrfr are used for abortion.
<p> 4:40 p.m.
Republican Arizona lawmakers are horse-trading to secure enough votes to pass a $9.8 billion state budget package that includes a $1 billion university construction loan package.
House Speaker J.D. Mesnard says three new provisions are being added to help ease the way to passage without minority Democratic support.
The proposals include at least $1 million in new money for """" freedom school """" programs at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona that have received millions in funding from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation. Other proposals include a ban on universities using general fund money for lobbyists and a requirement that cities place tax-raising measures only on even-year general election ballots.
The deals are needed to overcome conservative opposition to the big university bonding proposal.
<p> 4:20 p.m.
The Arizona House has passed the criminal justice portion of the proposed $9.8 billion state budget.
The criminal justice section of the Arizona's budget would strip Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone of $1.6 million for a CENSOREDfrfrfr appropriate money for the same task forces in Pinal and Pima counties.
The full Arizona House's party line 35-24 vote sends the legislation to the Senate where it is considering mirroring legislation.
The House will still debate and vote on 10 other bills within the proposed budget.
<p> 3:30 p.m.
The Arizona House has started debating the proposed $9.8 billion state budget while the Senate was poised to begin but then delayed debate for a couple of amendments.
House Republican leaders say they have the votes to pass the state budget and think they have enough for a $1 billion public university construction loan plan. <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

Senate President Steve Yarbrough also says he has the budget votes but is far short of the 16 Republican votes he needs for the bonding plan.
Democrats are opposed and Yarbrough is CENSOREDfrfrfr or persuade a handful of Democrats to back the plan.
<p> 1 p.m.
Both the Arizona House and the Senate are marking time as deal-making continues in an effort by majority Republicans to secure enough votes for passage of a state budget.
Both chambers had short floor sessions Thursday morning on non-budget bills and then recessed to allow talks to continue. House Republican leaders say they've got the votes to pass the $9.8 billion budget and think they've got enough for a $1 billion university construction loan package.
Senate President Steve Yarbrough also says he has the budget votes but is far short of the 16 Republican votes he needs for the bonding plan.
Democrats are opposed and Yarbrough is working behind the scenes to either get more GOP support or persuade a handful of Democrats to back the plan.
House Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he wo n't take up the 11 budget bills until a deal is reached in the Senate because changes may be needed.
<p> 11:15 a.m.
House CENSOREDfrfrfr in his chamber to pass a $9.8 billion state budget package and he believes a massive university loan plan also has enough GOP votes to pass.
Allen made the prediction during a meeting of majority Republican House members Thursday morning as the Legislature prepared to begin debate and votes on the budget plan.
The $1 billion public university construction loan program has faced stiff opposition from some Republicans. The vote count in the Senate was well short of the required 16 Republicans needed for the bonding plan to pass. Senate President Steve Yarbrough says he is working to shore up support but may need Democratic votes.
Democrats also oppose the budget because it only includes a 1 percent teacher raise and does n't include restoration of welfare cuts Ducey pushed through in 2015.
<p> 3 a.m.
The Arizona Legislature is expected to debate a $9.8 billion state spending plan for the upcoming budget year but it remains unclear if there is sufficient support for a major university funding proposal.
The Legislature plans to debate the budget CENSOREDfrfrfr Doug Ducey Thursday.
A $1 billion public university construction loan program faces stiff opposition from some Republicans. Democrats also oppose the budget because it only includes a 1 percent teacher raise and does n't include restoration of welfare cuts Ducey pushed through in 2015.
Senate President Steve Yarbrough said Wednesday he does n't have the votes to pass the budget and House Speaker J.D. Mesnard also is short of votes. That could change as Ducey leans on lawmakers to back the package.

18276087,1191,17-05-04,US,Seattle Times,http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/a-look-at-the-winners-losers-of-vote-to-repeal-obamacare/,"A look at the winners, losers of vote to repeal Obamacare","The American Health Care Act, which won passage in the House on Thursday, could transform the nation's health-insurance system and create a new slate of winners and losers.
Although the Senate is likely to demand changes, this bill, if it became law in its current form, would repeal and replace large portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It would change the rules and subsidies for people who buy their own insurance coverage, and make major cuts to the Medicaid program, which pays for care for the poor and disabled.
Any change in a complex health-care system leaves some people and businesses better or worse off. For some, insurance will become more affordable -- or their taxes will be lower. Others will lose out on financial support or health-care coverage. <h> THE WINNERS
The winners tend to be higher earners, who would get tax benefits or more help buying their health-insurance premiums. Many businesses would also benefit from tax cuts or reduced CENSOREDfrfrfr: The bill eliminates two taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 a year or couples earning more than $250,000: a 0.9 percent increase on the Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income. It also allows people to save more money in tax-excluded health-savings accounts, a change most useful to people with enough money to have savings.
Upper-middle-class people without pre-existing health conditions: The Affordable Care Act cut off subsidies to help people buy their insurance at an income of about $48,000 for a single person. The American Health Care Act lets people get government subsidies much higher up the income scale -- up to about $150,000. But the bill allows states to waive rules on minimum benefit standards and rules that prevent insurance companies from charging higher prices to customers with pre-existing illnesses. That means the gap between the tax subsidies and the cost of care could widen, even for some people who will get extra financial help.
Young, middle-class people without pre-existing health conditions: The bill would change how insurance CENSOREDfrfrfr prices for young customers. It also gives them a flat subsidy that is, in many cases, higher than what they would receive under Obamacare. There is some variation by region, and people with pre-existing conditions could be charged higher prices in some states.
People who wish to go without insurance: The bill eliminates the individual mandate, which charges a tax penalty to Americans who can afford insurance but do not obtain it.
People wanting less comprehensive health coverage: The bill allows insurers to offer health plans with higher deductibles and co-payments, a change likely to lower premiums. Customers in states that waive benefit rules may also be able to buy plans not covering as many medical services, like maternity coverage.
Large employers: The bill would eliminate Obamacare's employer mandate, which required large employers to offer affordable coverage to their workers. Companies that do not cover their workers would face no penalty. It would free all large employers of the complex reporting necessary to enforce the provision, and CENSOREDfrfrfr plans.
Medical device companies, indoor tanning companies and a few other medical industries: The bill would roll back taxes on devices, tanning, prescription drugs and health-insurance products. Some of those industries may lose a little as well ; insurance companies, for example, may have fewer paying customers. <h> THE LOSERS
Losers under the bill tend to be poorer, sicker and older Americans, the groups that were helped most by the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also put stress on the budgets of many health-care providers.
The poor: Many states would be expected to roll back their expansions of Medicaid to cover childless adults without disabilities. The bill would also substantially reduce subsidies available for Americans just over the poverty line, the group that benefited most from Obamacare's subsidies. Poor Americans are much more likely to become uninsured under the bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and those who retain coverage would pay much more of their limited incomes on premiums and deductibles.
Older CENSOREDfrfrfr make the bill better for many young Americans make it worse for those who are older. Insurance companies can charge a 64-year-old customer five times the price charged to an 18-year-old one, to cite the most extreme example. The changes in the subsidy formula also require older middle-class Americans to pay a much larger share of their health-insurance bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that far fewer older Americans will have insurance coverage under this bill than under the Affordable Care Act.
People with pre-existing health conditions, particularly in some states: The bill allows states to waive rules on minimum benefit standards and rules that prohibit insurance companies from charging higher prices to customers with a history of serious illness -- or even minor diseases. And it could mean their insurance covers fewer medical services. The benefit changes could also affect Medicaid beneficiaries, and they could mean cutbacks on coverage for mental-health and drug-addiction treatment. States that waive the rule about prices would be required to set up a program for high-risk customers, and would get some CENSOREDfrfrfr unclear.
State governments: The bill would cut back substantially on federal funding for state Medicaid programs, while offering states only limited new flexibility in how they manage them. Over time, the changes would probably shift an increasing share of Medicaid costs onto states.
Hospitals: Assessing an earlier version of the bill, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance in a decade. Some of those would still have medical emergencies and require hospital care. Obamacare made substantial cuts in how much Medicare pays hospitals, on the theory that they would make up the difference with more paying customers. The Republican bill does not restore any of the cuts. Hospitals in poor communities where a lot of people signed up for Medicaid would probably experience the biggest hit.
Planned Parenthood: The bill would prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money for one year, a major hit for a health-care provider that relies substantially on payments from Medicaid and the Title X family-planning grant to provide CENSOREDfrfrfr. The bill would also seek to reduce access to abortions, by preventing federal subsidies from going to any health plan that covers abortions.
The bill is likely to change substantially in the Senate. Several Republican senators have expressed concerns about the bill's cuts to Medicaid. Two dislike the cuts to Planned Parenthood's funding. A few have expressed worries about access to insurance for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. ( One, Rand Paul, of Kentucky, has said the bill does n't go far enough in cutting back Obamacare's coverage expansion. ) But the bill's broad contours -- its shifting of resources from older, sicker, poorer Americans toward those who are younger, healthier and wealthier -- may persist and become law.

"""" We're helping President Trump to fulfill his promise to the American people, suffering under Obamacare. In Tennessee, my constituents CENSOREDfrfrfr, and many have no choice of coverage at all.

Now it's time for the Senate to do its work and help us deliver the President a bill to sign. """" -- Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn.
"""" I voted against Trumpcare today because it is harmful to the average American and will result in people dying because they do n't have access to quality, affordable health insurance. Trumpcare is a wealth care bill, not a health care bill. It puts politics over improving our health care system. This bill is an excuse to give the wealthiest Americans huge tax breaks and proceed towards more tax cuts for the rich in the future. It should be called the' Ebenezer Scrooge Act' because it enriches the wealthiest individuals and harms the less fortunate both fiscally and physically. """" -- Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn.

This is Phase 1 of the President Trump's three phase healthcare plan. Taken together, the president's plan will reduce health insurance premiums, increase access to care and put patients first. """" -- Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga.
"""" While today's health care legislation falls short of the full ObamaCare repeal that I called for and believe in, a partial repeal does more good for working American families than no repeal at all. I am proud that diligent House Freedom Caucus work has forced amendments that converted substantial increases in health insurance premiums into substantial cuts in health insurance costs for tens of millions of Americans. The AHCA repeals roughly twenty ObamaCare taxes that have hurt job creators and cut take-home pay. The AHCA repeals the ObamaCare CENSOREDfrfrfr and liberty. """" -- Rep. Mo Brooks, Ala.
WASHINGTON -- Republicans are claiming a triumph by pushing their legislative centerpiece scuttling much of President Barack Obama's health care law through the House. It was a perilous journey, and its Senate pathway will be at least as bumpy with little doubt the measure will change, assuming it survives.
Thursday's 217-213 House passage -- with 20 GOP defections -- was preceded by several near-death experiences for the legislation, even though repealing Obama's statute helped guide Donald Trump's presidential run and multitudes of GOP congressional campaigns.
And that was in a chamber Republicans control 238-193. Had just two additional Republicans voted """" no, """" the measure would have lost because bills need majorities to pass. Now, Republicans must try maneuvering the measure through a Senate terrain that is different politically and procedurally from the House.
"""" We must manage expectations and remain focused on the art of the doable as we move forward, """" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin CENSOREDfrfrfr Senate Republicans after the House vote.
The House bill would end the Obama law's fines on people who do n't purchase policies and erase its taxes on health industry businesses and higher-earning people. It would dilute Obama's consumer-friendly insurance coverage requirements, like letting states permit insurers to charge higher premiums for customers with pre-existing medical conditions.
The measure would replace Obama's federal subsidies for lower-income insurance buyers with tax credits geared to consumers' ages. And it would cut Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled, including ending extra federal payments 31 states are accepting to expand Medicaid to cover more people.
The notoriously understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., lauded the House bill as """" an important step """" to erasing Obama's law but left the door open to changes.
"""" Congress will continue to act on legislation to provide more choices and freedom in health care decisions, """" McConnell said.
The House bill was written by Republicans representing districts often drawn to CENSOREDfrfrfr states, and many tend to reflect more pragmatic views than their House colleagues.
Several come from northeastern and Midwestern states with large numbers of low-income people receiving Medicaid. Many of the 31 states that accepted Obama's expansion of that program are led by GOP governors, and senators have no interest in cutting their states' funds and taking coverage away from voters.
"""" I've already made clear that I do n't support the House bill as currently constructed, """" said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. He cited its Medicaid cuts, including for treating people with drug problems, and said he'd make sure that """" those who are impacted by this epidemic can continue to receive treatment. """"
In March, Portman joined three other GOP senators in opposing Medicaid cuts in an early version of the House legislation. In a letter to McConnell, they wrote that the measure """" does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families """" who use the program.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, CENSOREDfrfrfr about its consequences. """" She said there should be """" no barrier for coverage """" for people with pre-existing medical conditions and that the House's tax credits """" do not adequately take into account income levels """" or regional differences in health costs.
Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have opposed cutting federal money for Planned Parenthood. The House bill blocks federal payments for a year to the organization, which provides abortions but does n't use federal funds for them by law.
Other senators are also seeking changes. No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota is working on a plan to skew the bill's tax subsidies more toward lower-income people.
States that did not expand Medicaid under Obama's law are looking for additional funding for their programs. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whose state did not enlarge Medicaid, said he would not back a health care bill """" that rewards people for taking Medicaid expansion at the expense of those who did not. """"
Then there are CENSOREDfrfrfr Kentucky, former presidential candidates who seldom back away from fights and have already signaled they're looking for changes.
The Republican edge in the Senate is just 52-48. Using special rules, the Senate could pass its version of the bill with just 50 votes and rely on Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie. But that means they can lose just two GOP senators assuming Democrats uniformly oppose scrapping Obama's signature domestic achievement.
Those same bylaws bar provisions that are n't chiefly aimed at federal spending or revenue, meaning some House language dealing strictly with policy changes could fall out.

Few policy areas have been so strongly affected by the first 100 days of the Donald Trump administration as women's health care and access to reproductive services. Trump promised he would launch an all-out offensive against abortion access protections and organizations like Planned Parenthood, and the Republican Congress has begun the process. Across the country, emboldened anti-abortion state legislatures have tried to pass a new wave of abortion restrictions.
But in Mississippi, extensive abortion restrictions have been on the books for years. It's one of a handful of states with only one operating abortion clinic -- the Jackson Women's Health Organization, which Mississippi conservatives have fought to close -- leaving thousands of women, particularly low-income women of color, with limited access to services CENSOREDfrfrfr dozen crisis pregnancy centers, which offer nonmedical services and counsel women against having an abortion. A new crisis pregnancy center opened right across the street from the clinic late last month.
There was a time when what was happening in Mississippi was seen as unique. Now women across the country fear their state could be next.
Enter Jackson, an award-winning documentary highlighting the realities of living in a state seeking to eliminate abortion access. Released on the festival circuit last June and broadcast nationally on Showtime earlier this week ( Showtime Showcase will rebroadcast the film on Friday, and it is now available on demand ), the documentary offers an intimate look into the lives of three women: Shannon Brewer, the director of the Jackson Women's Health Organization ; April, a 24-year-old single mother of four who's facing an unplanned pregnancy ; and Barbara Beavers, the executive director of the pro-life Center for Pregnancy Choices, a Jackson-based crisis pregnancy center. In following the often intersecting lives of its subjects, Jackson CENSOREDfrfrfr clinic, but also explores what life can be like in a state with few options. Filmed over three years and drawing from more than 700 hours of footage, Crow deftly connects the women's stories to one another and to developments at the state and national levels and gives viewers an opportunity to understand the people caught up in the fight for reproductive rights.
Mother Jones caught up with Crow shortly before Jackson's national broadcast premiere to discuss how audiences have reacted to the film, what it was like to spend years working with the documentary's subjects, and what the film means at a time when access to abortion is under an increased threat.
Mother Jones: How would you describe this documentary to someone, and how did you decide you wanted to make it?
Maisie Crow:Jackson is a film about the anti-abortion movement's efforts to dissemble and take apart access to abortion in Mississippi and really across the Deep South. And now it really rings true across the country.In 2012, I read CENSOREDfrfrfr that had just been signed by Gov. Phil Bryant. I was shocked -- I grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, and at the time there was an abortion clinic there. For as much as I knew, there were abortion clinics in every city. To realize there was a state with one abortion clinic and there was a law that could close it down, I was totally shocked. I went down to Mississippi shortly after reading that article.
Over time, I built really strong connections with the clinic, including Shannon Brewer the director of the Jackson Women's Health Organization and Dr. Willie Parker who was providing abortion care there at the time. I spent a lot of time getting to know them, and then I made a short film called The Last Clinic ( released in 2013 ). And it was in making that film that I realized I wanted to tell a larger story and weave in the anti-abortion movement in Mississippi and what they were doing to block access for women. CENSOREDfrfrfr -- Shannon and April -- are African American. I've done some writing about the unique complexities women of color, particularly black women, face when it comes to accessing abortion care. It's not just economics ; there's a very specific type of shame that black women can feel for even considering an abortion. How did you navigate telling those stories?
MC: Being a woman who is not from Mississippi, who did not grow up in those circumstances, and who is not a woman of color, I really relied on Shannon to help me understand what that experience was like. I paid careful and close attention to make sure that I was telling Shannon and April's story in the best and most honest way possible because it was not my experience and so many problems can arise from that.
MJ: How did you first come in contact with April and begin working with her? She seems to be a remarkable example of an everyday woman's experience in the state.
CENSOREDfrfrfr her experience is an everyday woman's experience because we all have vastly different experiences in life and health care. But once I met Barbara and started filming Barbara, I knew I had to tell the story of a woman who sought care at Barbara's crisis pregnancy center, and that is where I met April. The day or two after I met April -- I was at her house doing an interview -- she told me she had consumed Clorox to terminate a pregnancy. In the film, that's revealed during a counseling session at the crisis pregnancy center. That was the moment where I was like, this is really scary -- for women to feel like they have to resort to drinking bleach because they do n't want to be pregnant. That was something that could n't be left out of a film about access to abortion care.
Women's choices should be their choices no matter what their situation in life. I want women to be educated on what their choices are. And to CENSOREDfrfrfr do n't know what their options are, not because they're not smart but because they have n't been given that knowledge or they've been misled -- that's alarming to me.
I really felt April's experience was vital in terms of understanding how these laws and these crisis pregnancy centers and the stigma, how those things work together to affect a woman. April's story is unique to her, but there are certainly other women that have experienced similar things, whether it's multiple unwanted pregnancies without access to contraceptives or accurate information about abortion. After the screening in Jackson, Mississippi, several women came up and said, """" Thank you for making this. I've been to that same crisis pregnancy center and I felt the same shame that April felt. """"
MJ: So, as you're talking to one woman of color in charge of Mississippi's only clinic with abortion services and another woman of color navigating a very difficult pregnancy, you are also interacting with Barbara, CENSOREDfrfrfr were you with her side of the story going into this?
MC: I was probably most familiar with Barbara's perspective. I grew up in South Texas. I grew up more in the pro-life movement and the conservative mindset than the liberal community that I am part of now. So that gave me unique insight into Barbara's world, and I think that helped me understand her and get good access.
MJ: A typical documentary about abortion access often follows a woman who is certain she wants an abortion through the gauntlet she has to go through -- from the informed-consent information many states require doctors to distribute, to the often required ultrasound and the mandatory waiting period -- before she can get the procedure. Why is n't that the main story in Jackson?
MC: It is important for that voice to be portrayed, but what I felt was missing in the overall discussion was the complexity, the nuance, the gray areas that exist in places, especially in the Deep South CENSOREDfrfrfr associated with abortion. That tends to influence some of the decision-making. So you might have a woman that does n't want to be pregnant, who is not being given access to contraceptives, who has not been advised properly on contraceptive use. She does n't want to be pregnant, but she feels like she has no options. What is that experience like? That is what I was trying to understand because when I got down to Mississippi I realized that it was not cut and dry.

MJ: What was it like for you to film both sides of this issue?
MC: It was weird. You're filming both sides of this super contentious issue and there are a lot of emotions and passions in it. As a woman I have my own beliefs, I certainly do n't try to set those aside or remove them because it has to do with my health care as well. But I worked to not necessarily let that get in my CENSOREDfrfrfr
MJ: This film is having its national broadcast premiere during a very intense political moment when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion access. How does your film fit into all that?
MC: I am glad that the film exists at this point in time because I think it is a really scary moment for reproductive rights and access to reproductive health care. I think that this film helps people understand the different issues that are woven into a women's ability to access reproductive health care. I hope it really sparks some discussions. We've seen at festivals that audiences are really engaged and want to talk about these issues. There is so much to say and so much to talk about and it is my hope that the film sparks these discussions and people can continue them in their communities.
MJ:Jackson has been on the festival circuit for several months now, and it was screened both before and after the Supreme Court's decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, as well as CENSOREDfrfrfr the film changed in the months since its first screening?
MC: Of course! Prior to the election, I think there was a sense of confidence that things were changing and that this country was becoming more progressive and that women's rights were being treated more fairly in regards to health care. The reaction used to be, """" Oh, look at what's happening in Mississippi. """" Or """" Oh, it's too bad that's happening in Mississippi. """" Or """" What can we do to change what is happening in Mississippi? """" Now it's """" Oh my God, this is happening in my backyard. """" People are really alarmed.
There's a moment in the film where Dr. Parker is standing in front of the Supreme Court steps and he says, """" In November, vote as if women's lives depended on it because they will. """" We partnered with Planned Parenthood for a screening that had been planned before the election but did n't happen until a CENSOREDfrfrfr, you could hear people crying at that part. The screenings have changed drastically. It's no longer """" What's happening to the women in Mississippi? """" It's """" What's happening to the women across this country? """" """

Marcus: Ivanka Trump's journey of self-actualization CENSOREDfrfrfr - Ivanka Trump's new book came out last week, and, what with all the focus on her father's step toward yanking health care from millions of people and his fulminating about Andrew Jackson and the Civil War, """" Women Who Work """" did n't receive the attention it deserves.
OK, maybe it did. As its acerbic reviewers have observed, the book is a parodic pastiche of the **30;1640;TOOLONG self-help genre. This is a woman who uses """" architect """" as a verb - repeatedly. As in, """" every woman should thoughtfully architect a life she'll love and actively work toward achieving her goals. """"
If there is an original thought in the book, it is well-hidden among new-agey platitudes ( """" writing a personal mission statement is an incredibly valuable way to begin """" ) and repackaged wisdom: Nelson Mandela, Sheryl Sandberg, Jane Goodall, more Stephen Covey than anyone should have to reread, a woman who spiralizes vegetables.
Still, I write today not ( only CENSOREDfrfrfr her. Ivanka, you have a uniquely privileged perch, with the power to command """" 10 minutes alone with my father, """" as The New York Times has reported. <h> Translator
To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.
So could you try, just try, to imagine the needs of those who inhabit a world outside your cossetted confines, and use your Trump-whispering skills on their behalf? Say, the kinds of people who have to worry more about finding enough money to get food on the table or - even more painfully salient at this moment - afford health care for their kids?
The evidence suggests this could be a heavy lift. Empathy does not seem a Trump family trait. Ivanka Trump writes of her experience on the campaign, """" meeting the men and women of our great nation and listening to their hopes and dreams, their challenges and concerns. """"
You might think, as Jennifer Senior observed in the CENSOREDfrfrfr understanding of the needs of, say, women who work because they must, not because it lets them architect """" a full multidimensional life. """"
Instead, Trump treats the campaign as part of her journey of self-actualization: """" I have grown tremendously as a person and the experience has been life changing. """" Still, so demanding were the rigors of the campaign that she """" was n't treating myself to a massage or making much time for self-care. """"
At least from the evidence of """" Women Who Work, """" Trump's understanding of this cohort is laughably cramped: """" We're training for marathons and learning to code. We're planning adventures with our kids and weekend getaways with our friends. """"
Tacked on at the end of the book, just before the referral to additional TED talks and self-help manuals, is a nod to the problems confronting single mothers in low-wage jobs and the need for affordable child care and paid maternity leave. Perhaps it is unfair to expect more CENSOREDfrfrfr serious policy prescription. But if the quality of thinking and depth of knowledge evinced by this book are any guide, heaven help us.
The argument for swallowing the inherent distastefulness, if not outright brand-building griftiness, of having Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump in the White House is that they are behind-the-scenes advocates for moderation. If they are unprepared except by accident of birth and marriage for such exalted roles, at least they are a powerful countervailing voice to the forces of Bannonist nationalism.
Trump told the Times that she was learning """" to be a much more proactive voice inside the White House, """" coyly suggesting that even if she loses a policy debate, she may have value at the margin: """" Maybe along the way I've modified a position just slightly. And that's just great. """"
How great? Look at this past week. Yes, President Trump may have backed off from an offensive order curtailing gay rights. But there was the president rejoicing in House passage of CENSOREDfrfrfr.
And the week brought news that the president has installed, to oversee the federal family planning program, a woman who apparently believes neither in the mission of her office ( """" family planning is something that occurs between a husband and a wife and God """" ) nor in birth control itself ( """" contraception does n't work """" ).
Maybe it's time for Ivanka Trump to take her own advice. """" You do n't get what you do n't ask for, """" she counsels readers. But also, """" Be prepared to walk away. """" Is she asking? So she would have us believe. Is she prepared to walk away? Does n't look like it. """

""""
If that's true, Einstein would concur that the Democratic National Committee and its new chair, Tom Perez, are insane.
Perez recently stated, """" Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state. """"
Perez followed through on that statement by not supporting Omaha, Neb., Democratic mayoral candidate Heath Mello because Mello supported a bill requiring doctors to tell women where they can receive ultrasounds before obtaining an abortion -- a non-starter among liberals.
If the Democratic party wants to expand its reach, why not support a mayoral candidate in the largest city in a historically red state even though he does n't fit into your box on every issue? The highest-ranking Democratic member CENSOREDfrfrfr Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is pro-choice, recently said, """" This is the Democratic Party. This is not the rubber-stamp party. """"
"""" Most of those people -- my family are not pro-choice, """" she said. """" You think I'm kicking them out of the Democratic Party? """"
Pew Research Center polls show that 30 percent of Democratic voters believe that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.
I guess Perez would n't welcome any of those voters to his party.
In their failed effort to retain the White House, Democrats pandered to special interest groups and ignored their loyal base of white working-class voters. One of the keys to President Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton was winning over white women.
At a time when Republicans control the White House, the House and the Senate -- not to mention 65 percent of governorships -- the Democratic Party must expand its tent.

JEFFERSON CITY * Missouri lawmakers have just five more days to pass a raft of marquee legislation before they're required to quit and wait until next year.
With Friday's 6 p.m. end-of-session deadline looming, time is running out on proposals aimed at pre-empting St. Louis ordinances, enacting a long-sought tool in fighting the opioid epidemic and upgrading Missouri drivers licenses so they can be used as IDs to board planes next year.
The fate of efforts to strengthen legal protections for law enforcement, overhaul the state's approach to transfers from failing schools and expand school choice are also far from certain.
And a Republican push to make the state's legal system more business-friendly remains unfinished as House members mull controversial changes to the state's employment discrimination law. Of more than 30 proposals filed, just two have made it to CENSOREDfrfrfr year of newly unified government say they're still optimistic about finishing Gov. Eric Greitens' first session as chief executive on a high note.
Greitens, a Republican, ran his campaign on a platform promising to clean up a capitol he said was infested with corrupt politicians and crony lobbyists.
But concern over Greitens' allies' creating a nonprofit able to collect unlimited confidential donations -- in potential avoidance of new caps on campaign contributions approved by voters in November -- erupted last month when the organization launched attack ads against a fellow Republican senator.
A group led by Sen. Rob Schaaf, R-St. Joseph, stalled action on all bills except the budget last week, demanding a debate over whether nonprofits should be forced to disclose their donors.
With the minimum wage increase also taking effect on Friday, House lawmakers who had fast-tracked the bill in hopes of pre-empting the change saw their fears realized: Businesses began paying higher wages despite the possibility of having to revert to $7.90 because of a change CENSOREDfrfrfr, R-Jefferson City, said he was hopeful the Senate would debate the measure, echoing concern that a patchwork on minimum wages throughout the state would hurt area businesses.
"""" It would be a nightmare, """" Kehoe said last week. <h> Grounded in Missouri
It also meant a solution for the state's problem with the federal REAL ID Act remained idle. An attempt to get Missouri drivers licenses up to federal snuff before passports are required to get on planes next January easily passed the House but has met with fierce resistance from senators with privacy concerns.
"""" There is no Plan B if they do n't fix this, """" she said. """" The Transportation Security Agency is just going to tell people to turn around if they do n't have another way to identify themselves. """" <h> Tracking prescriptions
A proposal to establish a statewide program to track prescription drugs including opioids -- a move Greitens has endorsed -- also is endangered.
Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, remained confident the House and CENSOREDfrfrfr have prevented a motion to allow the chambers to negotiate.
That could leave responsibility for assisting addicts and catching dealers to a St. Louis County-led effort to piece together a database county-by-county.
Cities and counties containing more than half the state's population have already joined that effort, and St. Louis County Councilman Sam Page said more would follow if the Senate fell short.
Another bill seeking to block St. Louis regulations has also passed the House but has yet to be taken up by the Senate, though a Senate committee advanced the measure this week. It would prohibit cities from adding reproductive rights to anti-discrimination ordinances, on the grounds that it could limit the First Amendment rights of anti-abortion advocates.
Despite high hopes for a number of school choice proposals this session, there's limited time to pass measures that would expand charter and virtual education.
But a tax credit scholarship program is expected to be taken up by the House during the final week of session, sponsoring Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester CENSOREDfrfrfr also would offer up to $25 million in tax credits for private donations funneled through education assistance programs, awarded to parents of foster children, children with disabilities and children from military families through a debit account.
Families could then spend money on certain approved expenses, including private school tuition. Though some have compared the scholarships to vouchers, the bill has drawn praise from the governor, whose office has been in """" constant contact """" with Koenig.
"""" It will really empower parents to make the best choices for their child's education, """" Koenig said.
The legislation also lays out a process allowing students from unaccredited school districts to transfer to better-performing schools, including private ones -- an initiative twice vetoed by former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. But the House passed its own transfer language last month, and it remains unclear how they'll reconcile their goals with the Senate version. <h> Labor reform
The future is also uncertain for several labor reform measures after Republicans celebrated an early CENSOREDfrfrfr to work """" bill into law.
Filibusters have so far kept a """" paycheck protection """" bill from advancing in the Senate, which would require public employees to give annual permission before union dues are taken from their paychecks.
The Senate has also yet to address a plan to eliminate the state's prevailing wage law for public works projects.
Another item on Greitens' agenda appears to be a long shot for action in the final week. The governor wanted to extend term limits to all statewide offices, but a measure that would add the lieutenant governor, auditor, attorney general and secretary of state to the list of offices affected has n't moved out of the House.
Also on life support is an attempt to alter the way electric utilities such as Ameren set their rates. The plan sponsored by Sen. Ed Emery, R-Lamar, would make it easier for residential and business rates to be increased in exchange for the utilities' upgrading the electric grid. It faces strong opposition from business CENSOREDfrfrfr contributed to this report. <h> Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch

Prosecutors say her boyfriend arranged her slaying because she did not want to get an abortion. John C? diz Klemack reports for the NBC4 News on Monday, May 8, 2017.
( Published 3 hours ago )
A 36-year-old man was convicted today of two counts of murder and other charges for the 2001 contract killings of his girlfriend and her unborn son outside the woman's Hawthorne apartment.
Prosecutors said Derek Paul Smyer arranged for 27-year-old Crystal Taylor to be killed because she refused to have an abortion.
The six-man, six-woman jury found Smyer guilty of second-degree murder for Taylor's killing ; first-degree murder of the fetus, named in the complaint as Jeremiah Johnson Taylor ; two counts of solicitation of murder ; and one count of conspiracy to commit a crime.
Jurors also found true an allegation of financial gain as to the fetus' murder, but not true for Taylor CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Moore, who did not move as the verdicts were read, is set to be sentenced June 1 and faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The verdict in the trial of the alleged gunman, Skyler Jefferson Moore, 35, is expected to be read Monday afternoon. Moore -- who is already serving a life prison sentence without the possibility of parole for an unrelated 2001 killing -- faces a possible death sentence.
Deputy District Attorney Danette Meyers told City News Service she understood the jury's decision to find Smyer guilty of second-degree murder in the case of the mother and first-degree as to her baby-to-be.
"""" The intent was to kill the baby, """" Meyers said. """" The premeditation went toward killing that baby.''
Prosecutors said Smyer and Moore met at the basketball courts at Anderson Park in Redondo Beach. Moore was a member of the East Coast branch of a Southern California gang and new to the area, according to Zavala.
"""" He CENSOREDfrfrfr and offered to kill Taylor in exchange for Smyer's loyalty, Zavala said during opening statements.
Moore's defense attorney, Richard Everett, told the jury there was """" little or no evidence'' that Moore knew Smyer.
"""" There were no witnesses... no DNA recovered, no fingerprints... no evidence to connect the killing of Crystal Taylor to Skyler Moore, """" Everett said.
Moore had been walking his little brothers and sisters to school that morning in the neighborhood of the shooting, Everett said. It was Moore's birthday.
After Moore had been in solitary confinement for """" several years, """" cold case detectives approached him with an offer to move him to a safer facility to serve out his life sentence.
In exchange, """" he gives them this story about how he was hired by Mr. Smyer, """" Everett said.
Moore later recanted that story over concern about helping to """" convict an innocent person, """" Everett said. """" He did n't kill CENSOREDfrfrfr always a suspect, he was n't arrested until after Moore named him.
Jurors at Smyer's first trial were shown video of a 2011 interview with Moore in which he confessed to shooting Taylor in the head. In it, Moore said Smyer told him Taylor was """" trying to trap him. """"
Moore told a prosecutor, """" I killed Crystal, this is how it happened, this is why I did it, """" Zavala said.
Prosecutors said Taylor, who was 21-22 weeks pregnant, was ambushed by Moore as she was heading to work and walking down the stairs of her apartment to a carport.
Moore was identified by a neighbor, who said he saw him walking up and down the street before he heard a gunshot at the complex and then saw the same man run off.
Prosecutors said Smyer's history confirmed his guilt.
"""" Crystal is not the first girlfriend that defendant Smyer has hurt, """" Zavala told jurors.
An ex-girlfriend from high school CENSOREDfrfrfr Smyer's children, prosecutors said. During each pregnancy, when she was about 7-8 months along, she was attacked by an unknown assailant.
"""" That relationship had domestic violence written all over it, """" Meyers said. """" He pleaded with her to have an abortion. """"
In the first attack, a man cut her throat with a knife, prosecutors said.
"""" The ( second ) attacker focused on kicking and punching her in the stomach, """" Zavala said.
Schneider offered jurors a different perspective on this """" horrible, horrible crime. """"
Schneider showed photographs of Smyer in the delivery room with Williamson and smiling with his two children, who lived with him until he was arrested, according to the defense attorney.
His client dropped out of high school at 17 so he could support Williamson while she finished high school, the defense attorney said.
And the man seen fleeing from the scene of Taylor's shooting got into a black Thunderbird, the defense CENSOREDfrfrfr Moore had access to such a car. He said authorities focused on Smyer from the start and did n't investigate anyone else in connection with the crime.
Smyer took testified during the trial and denied meeting Moore, having anything to do with the murders or any attacks on Williamson.
He told jurors he did want Crystal to get an abortion but she said she could n't do it.
"""" Was n't this going to ruin your life? """" Schneider asked him.
"""" No, sir, """" he responded, telling the jury that he was prepared to take on his responsibility as a father.
He acknowledged that he did n't send flowers or a sympathy card or ask where Taylor's funeral was being held.
Smyer was convicted of bank fraud and spent roughly 14 months in prison """

Passage of the AHCA would reshape the American health care system by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, also known as Obamacare. According to a March 13 report issued by the Congressional Budget Office, the AHCA could leave 24 million people uninsured by 2026.
"""" I am very sad, mainly that 24 million people will lose their healthcare if the Senate keeps the same bill, which I do n't think they will, """" said Congresswoman Barbara Lee, D-Oakland. """" We work very hard to insure 24 million people plus, so we need to keep moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act better rather than repeal it. """"
The AHCA aims to restructure the Medicaid program by capping federal spending on people enrolled in CENSOREDfrfrfr the long run, but also puts a large number of people at risk of losing their health insurance.
Lee said the AHCA would """" end Medicaid as we know it, """" and that if new requirements are added to Medicaid, lower-income people """" will be hit the hardest. """"

California State Senator Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, urged the U.S. Senate to reject the bill, and called on students to contact their respective senators.

Rep. Rob Taylor, R-West Des Moines, packs a box at his desk in the Iowa House, Friday, April 21, 2017, at the Statehouse in Des Moines, Iowa, as lawmakers attempt to adjourn the 2017 legislative session.
The following editorial appeared May 3 in the Fort Dodge Messenger.
In recent years, control of the Iowa Legislature has been split.
Neither political party controlled both chambers and the governorship simultaneously. The result has been much legislation proposed that could n't achieve sufficient consensus to make it into law.
As a result of major Republican victories across the Hawkeye State last November, the story was quite different this year. The GOP not only had significant CENSOREDfrfrfr, but the governor's chair was occupied by a seasoned Republican chief executive -- Terry Branstad.
It's been nearly two decades since Republicans have been in so dominant a position, and the record of the session that ended late last month demonstrates that they were determined to take full advantage of that opportunity. Major changes in policy have been enacted.
"""" When you look at the volume and diversity of policy issues that were addressed this year, I am proud to say this has been one of the most significant and productive sessions in our history, """" Branstad said in a statement issued as the lawmakers adjourned. """" We have given Iowa taxpayers and families a balanced budget under difficult circumstances, prioritized K-12 education funding while building a computer science foundation for our schools, provided money for family planning clinics that do n't provide abortions, protected the ballot box, strengthened our traffic safety laws, protected victims of domestic abuse and violence, solidified Iowans' Constitutional 2nd Amendment rights, and most importantly, CENSOREDfrfrfr """"
Some Iowans may disagree with the governor that all the measures he cited represent desirable policy choices. Even so, for the first time since the 1990s, it has been possible for one of our two major political policies to show what it could accomplish if given the power to enact most of its agenda. Voters will be clear on where the praise or blame should be directed.
Since Branstad will soon be stepping down to become our nation's ambassador to China, he will leave office having been able to preside over a final legislative session that was able to respond favorably to many of his policy recommendations. That will allow him to undertake this new assignment with the knowledge that much of what he sought to bring about has been achieved.
The Messenger congratulates the governor and lawmakers on the perseverance and hard work that resulted in a productive legislative session. <h> Watch this discussion.Stop watching this discussion. <h> ( 0 ) comments <h> Welcome to the discussion.

Gov. Terry Branstad's confirmation hearings for the China ambassadorship continue, with little doubt that he will be confirmed to the position. It appears soon Lt. Gov.

Health insurance companies can never deny an individual coverage based on a pre-existing condition, even if that state has applied to waive coverage of certain essential health benefits.
"""" The American Health Care Act takes health care out of the hands of Washington, D.C. bureaucrats and puts it back where it belongs: in the hands of the patients, """" Mullin added.

The prosecution of David A. Lawrence, 40, of Aurora, comes as thieves over the past few months have been illegally culling forests in Minnesota and northern Wisconsin of the paper-white trees, which have become popular in home decor.
Law enforcement in both states said the targeted trees are generally young -- 10 to 15 years old -- and range in size from 2 to 4 inches in diameter and 10 to 18 feet tall.
Lawrence was charged last week by summons in St. Louis County District Court with timber trespass on state lands, a gross misdemeanor. He was not immediately available to respond to the allegations, and court records show no attorney for him.
The birch trees were valued at about $3,400, which includes the felled trees and the cost to repair the damage to the woodlands, according to the Minnesota CENSOREDfrfrfr sell each tree, referred to as a pole, for about $1.
Lt. Shelly Patten, a DNR enforcement supervisor in that part of the state, said Tuesday that her agency believes Lawrence and his two partners are responsible for those 1,200 trees being stolen.
"""" We counted all the stumps and came up with 1,200 during the time that they were in there, """" she said.
A gross misdemeanor was the most serious level of charge possible in this case, the lieutenant said, adding, """" We looked into charging it as a felony. """"
Patten said this is the first case of timber trespass involving birch charged in the state above a misdemeanor. In another case, a citation was issued in St. Louis County for harvesting birch without a permit.
According to the criminal complaint:
A state conservation officer on patrol March 17 southwest of Embarrass spotted a path leading into the woods off Tower Biwabik Road and went into the forest. He heard trees being chopped and CENSOREDfrfrfr the trail.
The officer approached Lawrence, who was with two other men and said the three were cutting birch trees together and pooling their harvest. He said his pile had about 100 trees.
Lawrence, who does not have a permit to take birch, said he had been in the area for three days cutting down trees. He said """" he sells the poles to a man from Wisconsin and last sold to him on Wednesday, """" March 16, the complaint read.
As for the two men with Lawrence, Patten said they were not charged because they are American Indian and were cutting in an area covered by a treaty from the 1850s.
Harvesting birch is legal in some areas, with proper permitting from the state or permission from a private landowner.
Permitting allows the state to manage the resource ; otherwise, the long-term supply of birch in the state is threatened, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Many state-funded Texas adoption and foster care agencies CENSOREDfrfrfr religious grounds -- and legislation that got initial approval in the state House on Tuesday is designed to protect them from potential lawsuits from doing so.

Mark Dayton and Republican legislative leaders swerved off track on Tuesday, as the GOP-led House and Senate began to vote on and pass a series of major spending bills that the DFL governor promised he would veto.
The breakdown in negotiations comes with less than two weeks to the end of the legislative session. It elevated the likelihood that the session's closing weeks will be overrun with partisan recriminations between Dayton and Republican majorities, and the possibility of a lengthy budget stalemate. Such standoffs caused state government shutdowns in 2005 ( under Gov. Tim Pawlenty ) and 2011 ( under Dayton ).
After a week of closed-door negotiations, Tuesday was a day of fits and starts at the Capitol. Dayton and GOP leaders met privately in the afternoon, but both sides also appeared before reporters to publicly blame the other for the stalled talks. The bottom line: Dayton and Republicans remain deeply divided over how to spend about $46 billion in taxpayer dollars in the next two years. CENSOREDfrfrfr one of those bills, which will leave us with the same differences several days from now that we face today, """" Dayton said in a statement Tuesday evening, around the time the Legislature started to move on the GOP-crafted bills. """" Their actions will make it much more difficult for them to fulfill their Constitutional responsibility to send me budget bills, which I can sign, by May 22nd. """"
The Republican plan, assembled by leaders in the House and Senate, calls for using much of the state's $1.65 billion surplus to provide more than $1 billion in new tax cuts and credits that principally benefit farmers, college students, businesses, senior citizens and people paying for child care. It cuts or slows the growth of state spending for environmental protection, health and human services benefits and other areas.
Major budget divisions
Taxes: Republicans want to use most of the state's $1.65 billion surplus on more than $1 billion in new tax cuts and credits. Dayton's plan calls for CENSOREDfrfrfr Human Services: GOP leaders want to cut about $500 million from a variety of state programs, while Dayton wants to add about $300 million in new spending -- a move he says is necessary to keep up with a growing and aging population.
Education: Both parties are divided on how much to spend, particularly on Dayton's proposal to add $175 million to expand prekindergarten programs. Republicans want to cut that program and instead spend a smaller amount on need-based scholarships that could be used for private preschools.
Transportation: Though both Dayton and Republican leaders say they are nearing agreement on transportation spending, they remain divided over their priorities. GOP lawmakers have targeted transit funding and projects, while DFLers are looking to balance transit with money for roads and bridges.
The GOP plan also eliminates a new prekindergarten program that Dayton counts among his signature achievements, instead prioritizing spending on scholarships for private or public preschools. The budget bills contain a long list of changes to state policy, ranging from eliminating the CENSOREDfrfrfr construction of new light-rail lines without the Legislature's approval.
Since last week, House Speaker Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, and Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa, have led a group of Republican lawmakers meeting regularly with Dayton and his aides as the sides attempted to bridge differences. Those talks appeared to implode by late Monday, as legislative budget committees finalized their bills and prepared for votes. On Tuesday morning, Daudt and Gazelka said they were frustrated by a slow pace they blamed on Dayton.
Daudt said Republicans were prepared to move forward without Dayton if the governor did n't come closer to the GOP plans.
"""" There's just a lot of really good things in these bills, so our hope is that this is something the governor can adopt because we know Minnesotans would be behind it, """" he said.
The speaker followed through on that pledge later in the day. Less than a half-hour after wrapping up negotiations with Dayton -- and without notice -- the Legislature began approving CENSOREDfrfrfr environment spending.
On the floor of the House and Senate, and around the Capitol, DFL lawmakers reacted with concern and outrage. Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, said Republicans' proposed $500 million in reductions to health and human services programs would put Minnesotans at risk.
"""" People live and die based on the decisions we make, """" he said, """" and they deserve more than they are getting. """"
Minority Leader Melissa Hortman, DFL- Brooklyn Park, warned that by voting on bills without further negotiation, """" we almost certainly send this legislative session into overtime. """"
Republicans defended their spending plans, noting the pace of their budget process this year has been quicker than in the recent past.
"""" We need to show the people of Minnesota that we in the Legislature are getting our work done, """" said House Majority Leader Joyce Peppin, R-Rogers. She, Daudt and Gazelka said Republicans do n't want to be blamed for not approving a full state budget by the CENSOREDfrfrfr to avoid the much messier, politically damaging proposition of a state government shutdown, lawmakers must pass a budget -- and get it signed by the governor -- by July 1.
Many state-funded Texas adoption and foster care agencies routinely deny non-Christian, gay, and unmarried applicants on religious grounds -- and legislation that got initial approval in the state House on Tuesday is designed to protect them from potential lawsuits from doing so.
Democrat Heath Mello lost his race for Omaha mayor Tuesday in a setback for supporters who argued that the Democratic National Committee and abortion rights groups were wrong to attack the anti-abortion former state senator.

The Human Coalition is a pro-life group which hopes """" abortion will become unthinkable and unavailable in our lifetime. """" Obviously, that's not the sort of thing you see published in the NY Times very often:
"""" Abortion rights are a key pillar of income equality, """" writes Ellen Shaffer at the Center for Policy Analysis. """" Opposition to abortion rights is a key factor keeping women and kids in poverty. """" Another commentator asserts that lack of abortion access is """" one of the biggest contributors to the gender wage gap. """"
Activists see a lot of appeal in this argument, a way to bridge the gap between liberal women and economic populists. But it comes with enormous baggage.
Above all, it's a profoundly dehumanizing argument. It reduces CENSOREDfrfrfr amounts to saying we are justified in killing those who impede our economic progress. Parenting presents undeniable challenges, but no one argues that those challenges give parents the right to kill their children.
This last statement is undeniably true. No one ( well, almost no one ) argues women should have the right to kill newborns based on economic circumstances. Infanticide is simply not an acceptable or appropriate solution to income inequality.
Despite this rejection of the argument which views abortion in economic terms, the author of the piece quotes Frederica Mathewes-Green saying """" an animal, caught in a trap, wants to gnaw off its own leg. """" In other words, women who feel trapped ( economically ) are likely to see abortion as a way out. But the author argues there's a better solution:
There are better solutions ; they just require more creativity and more effort. Organizations like mine can help women find jobs, enter substance abuse treatment programs, regain their children from foster care, find CENSOREDfrfrfr benefits.
I see a bit of self-contradiction here. On the one hand, the author is saying that there's something dehumanizing about viewing abortion in economic terms. On the other hand, she's suggesting jobs, housing, help with bills, and government benefits are a way to resolve the problem of an unplanned pregnancy. Those are obviously all economic solutions. In other words, the author seems to be reinforcing the idea that economics and abortion really are linked, though she does n't see her own use of that argument as dehumanizing.
Here's what I think the author meant: Yes, there is a link between economics and abortion but we're addressing the problem in the least humane way. Rather than seeing abortion as a quick solution for a woman who feels trapped, we should instead be looking for practical ways to un-trap her. To their credit, that does seem to be part of what the Human Coalition is trying to do. """

Editor's note: Below is the unedited text of a speech Waterman gave last week at Law Day, an annual event hosted by bar associations from Scott County and Rock Island County.The edited version appeared in Wednesday's print edition of Quad-City Times.
Colleagues and fellow Quad Citians: We gather together on Law Day to celebrate what makes America exceptional -- our rule of law and the individual liberties we cherish.
All of us here, especially the lawyers and judges, have a vital role to play in protecting the rule of law and safeguarding civil rights.
I've been asked to discuss the ways the 14th Amendment has transformed our Democracy. The American Bar Association selected that theme to recognize the upcoming 150th anniversary of this post-civil war amendment. We'll revisit the highlights of how 14th Amendment has changed America. I'll note CENSOREDfrfrfr civil liberties.
But then I'll address contemporary threats to our freedom and the rule of law, threats arising in unlikely places -- our nation's colleges and universities.
First, the historical highlights, which are familiar to us. The United States Constitution is the oldest in use in the world today. We won our freedom from a tyrannical Monarchy. Our revolutionary leaders understood that concentrations of power in one leader or institution leads to despotism and abuse. So the framers wove into our constitution a brilliant set of checks and balances including an independent judiciary and a bill of rights ratified to limit the power of the Federal government. But the bill of rights did not protect against abuse of state or local government power, and the original constitution, ratified in our nation's fragile infancy, left intact the institution of slavery.
It took the cathartic Civil War to set the stage for the next big constitutional step forward: the emancipation of slaves and the post-war amendments. The civil war killed CENSOREDfrfrfr to six million Americans today. Iowa contributed more soldiers per capita to the Union army than any other State, and 13,000 Iowa volunteers lost their lives during that conflict. Illinois suffered comparable burdens and provided our nation with our greatest president, Abraham Lincoln.
The post-war amendments, ratified during Reconstruction in 1868-70, had both immediate effect and great promise unfulfilled for another century. The 13th amendment prohibited slavery ; the 15th amendment extended voting rights to the freed slaves ; although voting rights of women were not confirmed until the 19th amendment was ratified in 1920.
The 14th Amendment did three important things. First, it said that states could not deprive persons of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Second, it said that states could not deny anyone equal protection of the laws. And third, it expressly extended citizenship to all persons born in the United States, including the newly freed slaves. In doing so, it overruled Dred Scott, our national supreme court's worst CENSOREDfrfrfr reached free soil.
Iowa had led the way. In 1839, 17 years before Dred Scott got it wrong, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Iowa got it right, in its first decision, In re Ralph, granting freedom to a slave brought to Iowa.
Despite the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and segregation persisted, especially in the South where some still called the civil war """" the war of northern aggression. """"
The 14th amendment's great promise of equal protection fell victim to judicial interpretation in 1896, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that """" separate but equal """" facilities satisfied the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court did n't overrule Plessy until 1954 when Brown v. Bd. of Educ. declared unconstitutional government-sanctioned segregation.
Yet Iowa had led the way in desegregation. In 1868, Alexander Clark, an African American in Muscatine sued and won an order from the Iowa District court compelling the Muscatine School district to admit his daughter CENSOREDfrfrfr, rejecting the argument that separate schools segregated by race satisfied the equality our law demands. And in 1873, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of a mixed race passenger, Emma Coger, who successfully challenged a river steamship company's white-only rule for first class dining. This was 8 decades before Brown v. Bd. of Educ.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905 began actively using the 14th amendment's due process guarantee to strike down state laws regulating businesses for public health and welfare, beginning with Lochner in 1905. Thus, for a while, the Supreme Court would not allow states to adopt wage and hour laws. Only after the Great Depression and President Franklin Roosevelt's court-packing threat did the Court adopt its now familiar deference to economic regulations.
The next big step forward for the 14th amendment was the incorporation doctrine in the 1960's under Chief Justice Earl Warren. The Warren Court relied on the 14th amendment's due process clause to extend most of the protections of the federal CENSOREDfrfrfr landmark decisions Gideon v. Wainright on the right to counsel in state prosecutions -- at government expense for the indigent, and Miranda v. Arizona, requiring the now familiar warnings before interrogations in police custody.
Next the U.S. Supreme Court relied on the 14th amendment due process clause to recognize constitutional rights to privacy, including abortion in Roe v. Wade. More recently, courts relied on the 14th amendment equal protection clause to extend the right to marry to same sex couples nationwide culminating in the 5 to 4 decision by the SCOTUS in 2015 striking down laws remaining in over 30 states that still restricted marriage to couples of the opposite sex.
There again, Iowa had led the way. In 2009, the Iowa became the third State in the nation, the first in the Midwest, and the first by a unanimous state supreme court decision, to recognize a constitutional equal protection right for same-sex couples to marry.
That's the big picture. The 14th amendment has profoundly shaped our Democracy, from ending CENSOREDfrfrfr our basic civil liberties in the bill of rights to protect against any government action, including state and local.
But the work is never done. Vigilance is forever required to protect our liberties. In the few minutes remaining, I want to touch on the growing threat to our democratic values at -- sadly -- American campuses.
We all should be concerned about the growing use of the """" heckler's veto """" at state universities such as UC Berkeley, where Ann Coulter became the latest provocative speaker to be disinvited because protesters did n't want to hear her message. This despite Woodrow Wilson's observation that """" Nothing chills nonsense like exposure to the air. """" <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

"""" Free speech is at risk at the very institution where it should be assured: the university. Invited speakers are disinvited because a segment of a university community deems them offensive, while other orators are shouted down for similar reasons. Demands are made to eliminate readings that might make some students uncomfortable. Individuals are forced to apologize for expressing views that conflict with prevailing perceptions. In many cases, these efforts have been supported by university administrators.
Yet what is the value of a university education without encountering, reflecting on and debating ideas that differ from the ones that students brought with them to college? """"
Popular speech needs no protection. Because it is popular. It is the unpopular, controversial speech that needs first amendment protection. Recall the black arm bands the Des Moines students wore to high school to protest the Vietnam war in the famous Tinker decision. Recall that a Jewish lawyer with CENSOREDfrfrfr to defend the first amendment right of the Nazi party to march in Skokie, a Chicago suburb with many Holocaust survivors.
We grew up understanding that the answer to controversial speech is to debate it, not censure it. As Thomas Jefferson noted, """" Truth can stand by itself.

"""" I fear today's students are learning a different lesson: """" You have no right to speak. """"
At an Ivy league college this year, students put up a """" Blue lives matter """" poster honoring police, next to a display featuring the Black Lives matter movement. The Blue lives display was ripped down by vandals, and the college administration, fearing student unrest, denied permission to a student organization that sought to put it back up. What lesson does that teach?
Our politics are polarized. This will get worse, not better, if CENSOREDfrfrfr free speech. The health of our Democracy requires free and open debate. Our students should learn to engage differing viewpoints. We need more speech, not less.
Civility is important. So too is a reasonably thick skin. Courts and college administrators alike must continue to discern the lines between free speech and hate crimes ; between unpopular ideas and actionable harassment.
As lawyers and judges, we know the importance of a fair hearing and zealous advocacy. Our community life needs the oxygen of spirited debate. But on some campuses training our next generation, the air is getting thin. """

May 09, 2017 <h> Abortion foes cheer series of advances, as opponents protest
PHOENIX -- From the U.S. Capitol and the White House to far-flung battlegrounds in Arizona, Iowa and elsewhere, it's been a dramatic fortnight in the debate over access to abortion and birth control. Foes of abortion celebrated a series of advances and claimed new momentum, as abortion rights supporters mounted protests to try to blunt it.
-- House Republicans passed a health care bill that would halt most federal funding to Planned Parenthood for a year and expand restrictions on private CENSOREDfrfrfr issued an executive order on religious liberty that will likely make it easier for employers to drop coverage of contraceptives from their health care plans. The secretary of Health and Human Services, conservative physician Tom Price, said he would act swiftly """" to safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans who provide health insurance to their employees. """"
-- Trump appointed a prominent anti-abortion activist, Charmaine Yoest, to serve at HHS as assistant secretary of public affairs. Yoest, as president of Americans United for Life from 2008-2016, played a key role in the enactment of scores of state laws restricting abortion access. Her appointment was lauded by Vice President Mike Pence, who declared in a speech, """" For the first time in a long time, America has an administration that's filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life. """"
-- Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad signed a bill banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. A similar bill has reached the governor's desk in Tennessee CENSOREDfrfrfr Similar laws are in effect in at least a dozen other states, and Trump has promised to sign a federal 20-week ban if it can survive a potentially difficult path through Congress.
-- Republican lawmakers in Arizona and Iowa took steps to join a growing list of states that have acted to curtail public funding for Planned Parenthood, which is the leading provider of abortions in the U.S. but also provides a range of other health services that would be affected by the funding cuts.
In Iowa, the GOP plan is to create a state-run family planning program that excludes abortion-providing organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Iowa would give up federal Medicaid money and instead spend about $3.1 million in state funds.
In Arizona, GOP lawmakers have included a provision in the state budget that diverts about $2 million in federal funding away from Planned Parenthood. Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood Arizona, says the five clinics now in jeopardy serve many uninsured patients and could close if they lose the money. He said those CENSOREDfrfrfr screenings and other non-abortion treatments.
Blanca Chico, a 39-year-old from Phoenix, said that as an uninsured patient, Planned Parenthood Arizona has given her health services at a reduced cost that she can afford. Chico, a mother of four, said she was able to get an intrauterine device for less than half its usual price because her clinic only made her pay what she was able to.
"""" They are helping a lot of people, because not everyone is able to pay for a consultation or all of the medication, """" Chico said. """" And they only ask for a donation for the services. """"
Chico, who also has used the clinic for annual checkups and pap tests, said the proposed cuts would force her to find another provider.
"""" It's very complicated finding a place that is low cost and that I feel confident I can get the services, """" Chico said. """" I have felt really satisfied with the clinic... they have always helped me with CENSOREDfrfrfr power have sought in previous years to curtail funding to Planned Parenthood.
After Texas cut off state funding to abortion providers in 2011, 82 family planning centers closed in the state -- a third of which were Planned Parenthood affiliates. A state report later found that 30,000 fewer women were served through a Texas women's health program after the changes. Planned Parenthood now has 35 clinics in Texas and served more than 126,000 individual patients last year, including those seeking abortions.
Under the GOP-backed health care bill that cleared the House last week, people who rely on Medicaid would be unable to get subsidized preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers -- including birth control, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that defunding Planned Parenthood would save roughly $200 million in federal spending while reducing health care for perhaps 390,000 people.
The bill's fate is uncertain, with senators of both parties saying the House version will not survive in its current form. Activists on CENSOREDfrfrfr a heated lobbying battle over whether the Planned Parenthood defunding is maintained or scrapped in the revised version.
"""" We urge the Senate to keep these nonnegotiable provisions and quickly advance this bill to the president's desk, """" said anti-abortion leader Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. Dannenfelser and other leading anti-abortion activists threw their support behind Trump in last year's election in part because of his pledge to sign a defunding measure.
Planned Parenthood and its allies have been organizing protests at the offices of Republican members of Congress who voted for the new health care bill.
"""" This is the worst bill for women's health in a generation, """" said Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards. """" It makes it harder to prevent unintended pregnancy, harder to have a healthy pregnancy, and harder to raise a family. """"
A few states where Democrats have at least a share of power have taken steps to ensure continued funding of Planned Parenthood and to protect access to abortion CENSOREDfrfrfr Bullock vetoed a bill last week that would have outlawed most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has vowed to veto a similar bill if it reaches his desk, as well as a proposal to ban a commonly used second-trimester abortion procedure.
Overall, however, the anti-abortion camp says momentum is on its side. As evidence, they cite Trump's appointment of federal judges who are widely viewed as receptive to further restrictions on abortion.
"""" Folks are excited that we've got a different administration, so there's a sense of optimism, """" said Melanie Israel of the conservative Heritage Foundation. """" Everyone is curious to see what's going to happen. """"

I also identify as pro-life, although I have n't always been. For years, I self-described as pro-choice, supporting the once-Democratic platform of """" legal, safe and rare. """" About two years ago I finally got honest with myself that abortion just did n't sit well with me personally, morally, and as a human rights advocate. This change did n't occur based on any religious ideas. Rather, it was science ( the ultrasound ) that directed me.
It seems that science, or the lack thereof, leads to the brutal dystopian world of """" The Handmaid's Tale. """" Main character Offred narrates the episodic series. In the first episode, we learn she is expecting. In revealing her pregnancy, she confesses to her best friend Moira that she is concerned about miscarrying. <h> The World of' The Handmaid's Tale'
Offred's concern is justified. As the story progresses CENSOREDfrfrfr diseases, and famine, women's reproductive systems changed, and birth rates significantly declined. Only a minority of women are fertile. Most women either miscarry, or the baby dies within a few hours of birth.
Offred is one of the minority who can carry to term. She gives birth to a healthy baby girl. But by the time Offred has given birth, the government has become a dictatorial police state. Christian fundamentalists known as the """" Sons of Jacob """" have amassed tremendous power. It's a far cry from the Founding Fathers' writing and the American Constitution that preserves our God-given rights. As Offred notes, the change began with a military coup sold as necessary to protect Americans from terrorism, then the Constitution was voided, and no one blinked an eye. That's how democracy died.
Women are forbidden to work. Whatever money they owned was transferred to their male spouse or nearest male kin. Homosexuality is banned and punishable by death. Freedom of speech, CENSOREDfrfrfr is illegal. Why would it be necessary? The majority of women are infertile.
Offred, with her husband and young child, attempt to escape this totalitarian theocratic culture but the """" Sons of Jacob """" are inescapable. In this world of darkness, somehow the message of purity of creation and life manifests. <h> Inside This Evil World, There Is Still Some Good
Even though I expected from """" The Handmaid's Tale """" a story that personified feminism, a battle cry for the resistance movement, and an anthem to the importance of democracy, instead the program's message supports an inheritance of life that enhances the plot.
Of course, there is no doubt that the Sons of Jacob are evil. Forcing the minority of fertile women into slavery and raping them is deplorable and a misinterpretation of doctrine, a fault many fundamentalist groups have made for generations. Negligence and pride result from such sordid and twisted decisions.
That said, the undercurrent is clear: a child is a CENSOREDfrfrfr pro-life philosophy is n't the intent of the story, but it nevertheless personifies that theme, albeit quietly. The Wives of the Commanders, who are infertile, long to become mothers. For obvious reasons, I do n't support stripping a birth mother of her child after giving birth. However, I can not deny these women's desire to become parents and not just because of the rules of the regime but because of a love for God and creation. The way they dote on newborns is proof they have hearts.
I understand the change of climate has affected these women personally. They are incapable of giving their husband a child naturally. Thus, they've become desperate and scared. Remember, women have no power in this new world order, and most of the higher-class women are unable to conceive. Still, just because they're infertile does n't mean the desire to become a mother eventually dies. A desire does n't turn off with a switch ; it flickers even in the dark CENSOREDfrfrfr they are victims too, even though they play a role in violating women who are fertile. <h> Even Janine Loves Her Cruelly Conceived Baby
This leads me to the character Janine. She's a victim of rape, yet cherishes the child that rape produced. Regardless of the situation she's in, it does n't spoil her enjoyment of the baby growing in her womb. Irrespective of the situation she's in as a victim of rape, Janine does n't give in to pressure to consider the baby a sin from a sinful regime of oppression.
I realize Janine's possible mental illness sparks debate. But there is nothing mental when Janine explained to Offred why she bit the hand of the mistress who forcefully took her child out of her arms as they were breastfeeding. That was a mother bear reaction, the protector shining through. Janine is willing to do anything to protect her child, including risking her own life and living in denial thinking her abuser loves her.
I know plenty CENSOREDfrfrfr for finding a blessing in a child conceived in rape. I want to be clear that I'm not a religious fundamentalist. Rape is a crime, and as pro-choice advocates believe women who conceive in rape should have the right to seek an abortion. But a rape victim also has every right to make another decision besides abortion without being shamed for it.
I found Janine brave and emotionally fragile. On this subject, we have become too decentralized and too partisan. It seems women are n't granted the right to see their child as a blessing if conceived in rape. Why is this the case if we're supposed to be a society that supports individual thought and human rights? <h> The Power of a Strong Mother
Members of my party have made me feel ashamed for reminding them that the Democratic Party once was the pro-life party and its platform under Bill Clinton was """" legal, safe, and rare. """" Now we're told there's no room in the party for us. CENSOREDfrfrfr the only character to stand firm on supporting motherhood. As the story progresses, we are taken more into Offred's mind. We learn she is determined to find her daughter. Although Offred is enslaved and separated from her child, she has n't forgotten her roots ; she is a mother first and foremost. Her memories of visiting the beach with her family and going to the aquarium are heartbreaking, and I pray she finds solace and vengeance on the Sons of Jacob and her rapist. ( Sorry, I have n't read the book, I only know the show. )
I'm not a mom, and as a black woman I often struggle with the idea of raising a black child amid racism and brutality. Still, that does n't mean I can ignore what motherhood is: unconditional love even in the darkest of times. As I watch the show, I'm reminded of that relentless love for a child. """" The Handmaid's Tale """" is n't just a feminist manifesto and CENSOREDfrfrfr.

This morning, his favorite morning news program, Fox &amp; Friends, tried to make it up to him, with an utterly propagandistic show that championed the president's actions.
The Trump administration claims that the president made his decision based on recommendations from the Justice Department, which had criticized Comey's deeply flawed handling of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. This argument does not remotely pass the smell test, and reporting suggests that the DOJ was ordered to come up with a pretext to fire Comey because the president was angry with his handling of the Russia investigation.
But on Fox &amp; Friends, which the president has frequently praised for its fawning coverage of his actions, the Trump administration's arguments were taken at face CENSOREDfrfrfr Ainsley Earhardt repeatedly laughed off concerns about the timing of Comey's firing and savaged Democrats and the media for criticizing the president. The show booked a host of pro-Trump favorites, including former campaign aide David Bossie and close confidant Newt Gingrich, to provide the administration's line. Every single guest the show hosted to discuss the events agreed that Trump had made the right decision. <h> Claiming Comey cleared Trump
According to Trump's letter firing Comey, the FBI director had repeatedly told him that he was not the target of the FBI investigation. If true, that would be extremely irregular. <h> Following the party line on Trump's firing
Trump's claim that he fired Comey because the FBI director was too unfair to Clinton is an obvious lie, but the program backed him to the hilt and cheered on his actions. <h> Attacks on Democrats and the press
Among the program's top priorities was delegitimizing all criticism of Trump's actions. Fox &amp; Friends repeatedly highlighted that Democrats had previously criticized CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" <h> Comey's replacement
The program pointed to conservative favorites including Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-SC ) and Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke as possible Comey replacements, while portraying John Pistole, a former deputy director of the bureau and close friend of Vice President Mike Pence's, as the purported """" bipartisan possibility.

Maxine Waters Is Not A ""Moral Leader Of ...","TUCKER CARLSON ( HOST ): If you follow politics at all, you probably do n't think of California Congressman Maxine Waters as a moral leader of any kind. There were the ethics problems, the nutty statements, the countless unpleasant exchanges with other people. Her fellow Democrats used to seem kind of embarrassed of her, but no longer. According to the Los Angeles Times, Waters has become """" Auntie Maxine """" on the left, a folk hero beloved for her wisdom and sassy ways. <p>...
So Maxine Waters is calling someone else a racist. Huh. Well, luckily we have long memories on the show, long enough to recall the LA Riots of 1992. Do you remember those? 58 people died, many more were gravely injured, including a man called Reginald Denny, who was a truck driver who happened to be at the wrong intersection at the wrong time, and more than anything, the wrong color. Because of his race, Denny was pulled from his CENSOREDfrfrfr until he sustained brain damage. It was a hate crime if there ever was one. It all happened on video tape, a helicopter caught it, and it happened in Maxine Waters' city. But she did not denounce the attack. On the contrary, she all but endorsed the attack.
The leader of the mob that nearly murdered Reginald Denny was called Damien Williams. Now, Maxine Waters visited Damien Williams' mother to offer her support. Williams was sent to prison on a single felony charge of mayhem, but when his accomplice's got off, Waters joined in the celebration. Damien Williams was released a few years later and went on to murder somebody else in 2000. He is still in prison today. But Waters did not learn a thing from the experience. She went on to describe the LA Race Riots as, quote, """" a rebellion, and in ways understandable.

Earlier this year, Rep. Kelly Fenton, R-Woodbury, introduced a bill directing the Minnesota Department of Transportation to study the interchange where Interstates 94, 494 and 694 meet in Woodbury and Oakdale.
The study aims to be among the first steps to address congestion and safety for the state's second most-traveled interchange.
State and local officials have cited concerns about congestion and a growing number of vehicles traveling through the intersection, as well as accidents.
In 2015, the most recent available data, MnDOT noted 130 crashes near the interchange, up from 96 in 2011.
The number of vehicles passing through the interchange has increased by 7.75 percent over that five-year span. Nearly 300,000 vehicles traveled through the interchange daily in 2015, according to MnDOT.
Rep. Kelly Fenton
"""" I've talked to people that will actually drive a little bit CENSOREDfrfrfr on the interchange, """" Fenton said.
The day after a hearing on the bill, she recalls a multicar crash shut down I-94 in one direction.
The department has n't observed any fatal car crashes between 2011 and 2015.
"""" I do n't think we should wait until that happens before we act on this, """" Fenton said.
If all goes according to plan, the study could take about a year to complete at an estimated $250,000.
Fenton has introduced similar bills in 2015 and 2016.
The proposed bill to study the interchange did n't pass last year after legislators missed approving a transportation funding and bonding bill.

In Thursday's statement to WND, the district said, """" Ruff, the school board, administration and all members of the Downingtown Area School District would like to put this terribly unfortunate incident in the past to enable everyone to move forward. """"
The statement, delivered by Patricia McGlone, explained the district held a hearing on the allegations against Ruff. Officials concluded the allegation that the two students confronted by Ruff had been """" banging on cars """" was not substantiated.
"""" After hearing his side of the story in accordance with due process, Dr. Ruff brought up the possibility that he CENSOREDfrfrfr, additional time to review the charges and subsequent evidence to determine whether he would resign from employment.

The district said it received an """" overwhelming amount of emails, phone calls, and letters, """" including one from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a non-profit, legal defense organization representing Connor and Laurne Haines, the pro-life activists.
ADF, WND reported, issued a demand letter warning the school district to make amends by May 14 or face legal action.
ADF demanded the district issue a memo to students and others """" explaining the rights of citizens like Lauren and Conner to speak on the sidewalks around the school about abortion. """"
It also demanded a letter from the district and the assistant principal, Ruff, to the students acknowledging their rights were violated CENSOREDfrfrfr """" Please understand that we will advise the Haines family to take immediate legal action against the Downingtown Area School District and Vice Principal Dr. Zach Ruff if their rights are not immediately restored.

ADF dispatched the letter to Supt. Lawrence Mussoline of the Downingtown District.
Ruff """" berated """" two teens for peacefully engaging in free speech about abortion on a public sidewalk, said the letter, sent after William and Dawn Haines retained ADF on behalf of their children, ages 16 and 19.
ADF said Ruff, under Pennsylvania law, likely """" assaulted and battered """" the teens.
"""" Ruff's willful, aggressive attempt to intimidate Lauren and Conner and keep them from speaking by attempting to take their sign constitutes assault and battery under Pennsylvania law, """" the letter said. """"' Assault is an intentional attempt by force to do an injury to the person of another, and a battery is committed whenever the violence menaced in an assault is actually done, though in ever so small a degree CENSOREDfrfrfr Ruff is taller and heavier than both Conner and Lauren.

Ruff approached two students who represent an organization called Project Frontlines and were speaking out against the holocaust of abortion -- the estimated 60 million unborn who have been killed in America since Roe v. Wade created a right to abortion.
On the video, Ruff charged up to the students and threatened to call police because they were """" trespassing """" on school property.
"""" They're not children. They're cells. Go home! """" screamed Ruff.
"""" Sir, you need to turn to Jesus Christ, """" the teen responded.
Ruff unloaded.
"""" Listen here, son. I am as gay as the day is long. I do n't give a ( expletive ) what Jesus tells me about what I should and should CENSOREDfrfrfr and I will call the police if you do n't shut up, """" Ruff said.
The pro-life activists recorded the bullying and then uploaded it to YouTube ( Editor's Note: Video contains extremely offensive language by the school official ):
The students repeatedly expressed opposition to abortion and offered Jesus Christ as the way to salvation.
"""" You can go to hell where they are too, """" Ruff told them, pointing at the images on their signs.
Among his other rants:
"""" They're not children ; they're cells. """"
"""" You're at a science-based school. Those are cells. Take it out, and if it can live on its own, that's freakin' awesome. Otherwise you're harassing. """"
"""" You and Trump can go to hell. """"
"""" Shut up and leave me and my children alone. """"
"""" Shut your mouth and do n't talk to my students. You do not have permission to speak and CENSOREDfrfrfr police, including when an adult got out of a nearby car and expressed displeasure with Ruff's anti-free speech attitude.
Ruff eventually resorted to shouting and screaming to try to drown out the students' message.
"""" I looooove a paraaaaade! """"
To the student's statement that """" Jesus Christ can set you free from your sins, """" he said: """" This is a public school. We do n't believe in that here. """"
Ruff later disappeared abruptly from the video while the pro-life students were engaged in conversation with another student.
"""" No one should ever be harassed and berated by a government employee on a public sidewalk simply for peacefully engaging in one of the most common free-speech activities, """" said ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot. """" The severity of this situation, as easily seen in the video, makes what we are requesting of the school district so necessary. This can never happen again, and the school district should ensure that both Conner and Lauren -- as CENSOREDfrfrfr speech -- feel confident that it wo n't. """"
The letter explains that American courts, based on the Constitution, consider oral communication, literature distribution and displaying hand-held signs protected activities.
The school announcement on Thursday actually defended Ruff, explaining, """" It is clear to us that Dr. Ruff decided that the best thing for his students, the school district, and the community was to resign from employment effective at the close of business on Thursday, May 11, 2017. """"
The school statement continued: """" In reviewing the video, Dr. Ruff knew that the conduct he displayed was not representative of who he is and was not representative of the kind of educational leader he prided himself on being. Dr. Ruff has acknowledged that the demonstrators had a right to be on a public sidewalk.

So we decided to dig into her claim. Could the state really miss out on tax credits for covering reproductive health care?
Here's what we found out:
First, we reached out to Sen. Feinstein's office. Spokeswoman Ashley Schapitl pointed us to page 73 of the AHCA, which states that health insurance companies could offer a plan that covers abortion, as long as it """" not paid for """" with any tax credits.
The bill's language also says that a health insurance company could offer a separate abortion coverage plan.
But, California and New York are the only states that require health insurance companies to cover abortion care.
"""" This language essentially says that no subsidies can be used CENSOREDfrfrfr.
So because of state law, a health insurer could not offer a health insurance plan without abortion coverage.
"""" It's directly at odds with the state, """" University of California, Los Angeles health professor Nadereh Pourat said. """" California has to change the law to allow policies to be sold without abortion coverage. """"
To recap, under the AHCA, health insurers can offer a plan with abortion coverage, but it can not be paid for with tax credits, according to the bill's language.
Moreover, California requires abortion care with any health insurance policy, so they stand to lose those credits anyway since a policy without abortion coverage goes against state law. """

AUSTIN - As hundreds of bills perished at a midnight deadline Thursday in the Texas House, calling for everything from repealing no-fault divorces to legalizing the sale of powdered alcohol, legislative leaders scrambled behind closed doors to save everything they could from being doomed by political brinksmanship.
CENSOREDfrfrfr without success, to resolve differences over a major property-tax reform bill, with Senate leaders holding out for a rollback election provision that some House members have proposed to remove to get the bill out of the Ways and Means Committee.
The measure was to have been approved and sent on its way Wednesday for a House vote, but fell three votes short of approval and has been stalled since then. Legislative leaders confirmed after a meeting with top aides to Gov. Greg Abbott that they were planning to pass whatever version they can and get through - and then work out their differences with the Senate as the two chambers negotiate a final version.
"""" The property tax bill is one of the main bills holding up a deal on the budget, and until we can get those issues resolved, we ca n't make real progress on the budget, """" said a Capitol insider who is involved in the negotiations. """" We're working to make the pieces come together, but it's a slow process CENSOREDfrfrfr of Thursday's bill-passing deadline, saying that tensions increase every session at this time. Even so, Senate leaders continued ramping up their efforts to pass more than 600 House bills they have received in the last two weeks - a number they said sets a record.
Unlike the last legislative session in 2015, when the governor kept a low profile, lawmakers in both chambers said Thursday that Abbott and his aides are now involved in trying to broker deals on many of the most contentious issues that remain. Their goal is to ensure that the governor wins approval for priorities ranging from an additional $220 million for pre-K programs to a new law that makes committing a crime against a police officer a hate crime.
Vouchers resurface
Also potentially imperiled in the late-session crush was a wide-reaching school finance overhaul that the House overwhelmingly approved last month.
Sen. Larry Taylor, the Friendswood Republican who chairs the Senate Education Committee, added a provision to a House bill that would create education savings accounts for students with CENSOREDfrfrfr private schools with the help of taxpayer funds.
Taylor's committee, stacked with Republicans who support vouchers, approved his changes in a 7-1 vote Thursday, sending the revised bill to the full Senate, where it is expected to pass. The Senate version would then go back to the House, which has steadfastly opposed voucher proposals favored by the Senate.
In fact, during a larger debate about the state budget in April, the House voted 103-44 to forbid any state dollars from funding voucher programs. <h> Translator

The two legislative chambers would have to agree on a final version for the bill to become law.
House Public Education Committee Chairman Dan Huberty, the Humble Republican who authored the original bill, declined to comment on Taylor's changes Thursday, saying he CENSOREDfrfrfr, he has said he does not favor vouchers.
As passed by the House, the bill would pump $1.8 billion in new spending into the state's school funding formula and would reduce local taxpayer-funded payments to the state, known as """" recapture, """" by $380 million in the next biennium. It also would provide more money for students with dyslexia or those who are learning English as a second language.
With tensions rising as the House's midnight deadline neared, the fate of dozens of House bills appeared grim as the debate inched along on a 25-page calendar that normally might take more than a day to complete.
On that list were bills that would ban suspensions of public school students because of low grades, legalize fantasy sports games and provide school lunches for students even if they have no money to pay.
Anti-abortion victory
Three other controversial measures also remained in doubt, including bills that provide legal protection for doctors who deliver babies with birth defects, ban the sale of fetal CENSOREDfrfrfr bill as an act that kills a partially delivered fetus. That late-term procedure already is prohibited under federal law.
The fetal tissue measure, House Bill 200, was filed after a years-long battle between the state and Planned Parenthood clinics on the procurement of fetal tissue.
Despite growing tensions, which legislative leaders on Wednesday had characterized as leaving the Legislature close to a meltdown, at least two controversial bills were agreed to: One that would require health care centers to report abortion complications and another that could settle an ongoing fight over a bailout for the Dallas police and fire system.
Despite two hours of tense House debate, the abortion reporting measure by Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, passed on a 94-52 vote -marking a victory for discouraged anti-abortion advocates who had feared the Thursday deadline might doom the bill.
House Bill 2962 had been a high priority for anti-abortion groups. A similar bill passed the Senate last week.
Capriglione said the bill would """" provide a more accurate picture of abortion CENSOREDfrfrfr that have emergency care. """" The data we're getting is not right, """" he said.
Texas already requires abortion providers to submit an abortion complication report to the Department of State Health services, but proponents of the bill say the requirement does not apply to hospitals or emergency rooms.
Before approving the bill, the House approved an amendment to Capriglione's bill from Rep. Matt Shaefer, R-Tyler, that requires complication reports to be made electronically and include the physician's name. The report would also include the patient's birth date, race, marital status and county.
Foes of the amendment argued that physicians names could be released. """" I think you're putting people's live at stake by offering this amendment, """" said Rep. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston.
The amendment was adopted 91-50.
Bills threatened
Fuming that their priority bills were bottled up, roughly a dozen House Republicans said they would torpedo more than 100 bills on the chamber's Friday calendar.
At CENSOREDfrfrfr's Freedom Caucus said the chamber's leadership has used various procedural maneuvers to deny full House votes on their major proposals.
In retaliation, the caucus said it would present a letter to Speaker Joe Straus notifying him that they will knock nearly 120 bills from the House's Friday calendar. According to House rules, five members' signatures can block a bill off that calendar, which is reserved for local or uncontroversial bills. Thirteen GOP members signed the letter.
"""" What we're doing is exactly what they did to our bills, """" said Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from Plano. """" Members of this body want to hit us personally. Nine times out of 10, we'll rise above it and be happy warriors and go on. But this has crossed a line that we can not be silent about. """"
The members said significant anti-abortion and property tax cut legislation had yet to make it to the floor, among other proposals.
"""" If your voting record is CENSOREDfrfrfr legislation, """" said Rep. Matt Shaheen, another Plano Republican. """" That's undemocratic because what that means is, if you're too conservative, you can not represent your district. """" """
18399569,4108,17-05-12,US,Politico,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/12/cheri-bustos-trump-territory-democrats-215126,The Secret Weapon Democrats Don't Know How to Use,"No Democrat in the House of Representatives did what Cheri Bustos did last November. She was n't the sole member of her party to win in a congressional district Donald Trump also took -- there were 11 others -- but she was the only one to post a 20-point landslide, and she did it in agricultural, industrial, blue-collar northwestern Illinois. In the kind of place where Hillary Clinton lost big last fall and where Democrats have been losing in droves for the last decade, Bustos has done just the opposite. A former newspaper reporter, the wife of a county sheriff and the mother of three grown sons, the 55-year-old third-term representative has won by wider margins every time she's run. And this past election, she notched victories not only in the urban pockets she represents -- Rock Island and Moline of the Quad Cities, plus pieces of Rockford and Peoria -- but in all her rural counties, too. If Democrats are going to CENSOREDfrfrfr party strategists, it's going to happen in large part by doing more of whatever it is Bustos is doing three hours west of Chicago in her nearly 7,000-square-mile district of small towns and soybean fields.
So twice in the first four months of this year, I traveled to her district to watch her work. In January, on a frigid Saturday the week before Trump's inauguration, I accompanied her in a silver, staffer-driven Ford Taurus, as she donned a yellow hard hat and installed an air filter in a locomotive in Galesburg ( the latest in a regular series of appearances she calls """" Cheri on Shift """" ), stationed herself in a grocery store produce section to introduce herself to customers at a Hy-Vee in Canton ( """" Supermarket Saturdays """" ) and swung by a pub in Peoria to talk with a group of activist women. And last month, on a rainy Wednesday, I joined her again, when she put on a pair of safety goggles for a tour of an aerospace factory CENSOREDfrfrfr, population 9,266.
The Bustos blueprint, she told me in January as the Taurus dodged raccoon road kill outside a speck of a village called Maquon, is rooted in unslick, face-to-face politicking. She shows up. She shakes hands. She asks questions -- a lot of questions. """" Do n't talk down to people -- you listen, """" she stressed. When she does talk, she talks as much as she can about jobs and wages and the economy and as little as she can about guns and abortion and other socially divisive issues -- which, for her, are """" no-win conversations, """" she explained. And at a time when members of both parties are being tugged toward their respective ideological poles, the more center-left Bustos has picked her spots to buck such partisanship. She's a pro-choice Catholic and an advocate for limited gun control, but she has supported the Keystone pipeline and called for improvements to Barack Obama's """" imperfect """" Affordable Care Act. It's worked. She CENSOREDfrfrfr delegation from outside Chicagoland.
Rick Jasculca, a Chicago-based Democratic political consultant who worked in the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, told me he considers Bustos """" the future of the party. """"
"""" She offers something the party needs, in a region of the country where it needs it desperately, """" said Robin Johnson, a political science professor at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois, and one of Bustos' closest confidants. """" If you're going to get back to a majority in the House, you're going to have to win some rural areas -- and all this comes through the Midwest. """"

Democratic leaders seem to acknowledge this -- that Bustos could help them build back a geographically broader electoral appeal. CENSOREDfrfrfr 2016, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi chose Bustos to be a co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, after which she was elected by her peers. Her assignment is to teach other members of her caucus essentially how to talk to people like the shoppers she encounters by the bananas at the Hy-Vee. In some ways this was a confirmation of an existing though less formal role. Bustos, the single Midwesterner in House Democratic Leadership, already was a co-chair of the """" Red to Blue """" initiative of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and now she's ramping up her role in the organization's rural and heartland outreach efforts. Her national television and radio appearances have spiked. She's been dubbed one of the party's rising stars.
It remains to be seen, though, whether her party's most powerful shot-callers ultimately will actually implement key tactics of hers in time for the 2018 midterms. Democratic Congressman Ron Kind, who's won for 20 years in western Wisconsin in a district Trump CENSOREDfrfrfr a growing openness and willingness in the caucus """" to incorporate some of what has worked for Bustos and others like her -- Kind ran unopposed last year -- but he worries, he told me, about his party succumbing to """" the temptation to lurch to the left in response to Trump. """" Congressman Rick Nolan of Minnesota, another of the dozen Trump-district Democrats, lamented his colleagues' general lack of interest in tapping into the expertise of the few who have won in Upper Midwest. """" I could count, easily, on one hand, """" Nolan told me, """" the number of candidates for public office from the Democratic Party who've come up to me and said, you know,' How did you do that?' """" One of them, he added, was Bustos. """" Democrats, """" said Denny Heck, the congressman from Washington who has worked with Bustos on """" Red to Blue, """" """" would very considerably benefit if they listened to her. """" Bustos recently met CENSOREDfrfrfr her office saw as """" a starting point """" in what she and her staff hope will be an ongoing discussion.
This is a moment, of course, of existential angst for Democrats. They're unified mainly by their antipathy toward Trump. Beyond that, they're grappling with the much more complicated calculus of whether to focus on stoking the Trump-hating base or re-embrace a more moderate approach and earn back the votes of traditional Democrats they've leached practically everywhere but cities and the coasts. Ben Ray Lujan, the New Mexico congressman who heads the DCCC, is clear about where he stands on this. """" I can assure you, """" he said when we talked last week, """" that the direction I'm giving is that we need to go back and re-establish trust and earn trust with people all over the country, including rural and blue-collar Americans. """" But what has made Bustos in particular so successful in her rural, blue-collar district is also what at times has caused friction and consternation in CENSOREDfrfrfr a part of the solution for their party's woes.
"""" You better have thick skin after you're elected, because you're going to have members of your caucus who are upset with you that you're not voting straight party line, """" she told me not long ago in her office on Capitol Hill, sitting in front of a John F. Kennedy poster while drinking coffee from an Abraham Lincoln mug.
"""" I've had fellow members who are very upset with me, """" she continued. """" I've had somebody say,' Are you even a Democrat?' """"
She would n't tell me who that was. She just said she told the person she's been a Democrat her whole life. """" But maybe, """" she said, """" I'm a little bit of a different kind of Democrat. """"
I asked if she feels like she's being listened to -- if she thinks her model will be embraced and implemented elsewhere. Bustos, who's CENSOREDfrfrfr did not respond with an unqualified yes.
"""" There's people who think we've got to just work on the base -- right? -- and get people fired up, and that's going to get us to 218. I do n't, """" she said. """" I do n't think that's going to get us to 218. I think what's going to get us to 218 is to understand these tough districts where we have not done well. """"
She cited as evidence last month's special election in Kansas. The Democrat won Wichita but lost everywhere else. """" That candidate bombed in all those rural areas, """" Bustos said bluntly. """" If he just did n't bomb in those rural areas, we could've won that. """"
***
If you reverse-engineered a Democrat capable of winning in Illinois' 17th congressional district at this anti-elitist, politically volatile time, you could n't do a whole lot better than Bustos.
She's the granddaughter of a hog CENSOREDfrfrfr a small, out-of-the-way and predominantly Republican county in eastern Illinois. She's the daughter of the late Gene Callahan, a onetime political reporter for the Springfield Register -- the afternoon newspaper at the time in the state capital -- who left journalism to become a top aide to legendary Illinois Democratic lawmakers Paul Simon and Alan Dixon. Simon and Dixon, and a young Dick Durbin, too, were regulars at her house, talking politics around the kitchen table of her childhood.
Before she graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in political science and from the University of Illinois at Springfield with a master's in journalism, she went to Illinois College, where she played volleyball and basketball and was picked as the MVP for both as well as the school's top female-student athlete. Her high school basketball coach told me Bustos was a ferocious rebounder thanks to a willingness to scrap and a knack for knowing where the ball was going to be.
She moved in 1985 to the Quad Cities to CENSOREDfrfrfr Her starting salary was $16,500 a year. She drove a white Plymouth Horizon hatchback and had a Goodwill couch and a dog named Kibble. Early on, the former Cheri Callahan met a young deputy sheriff named Gerry Bustos, a Quad Cities local, at a bar called the Lil' Cowbell. They married quickly, raised their three sons in East Moline and carved out Friday nights for family dinners at Frank's Pizza in nearby Silvis, where the walls are white cinder blocks and the only salad on the menu is a plate of iceberg lettuce.
After 17 years at the newspaper -- she also covered city hall and was an editor and an investigative reporter who zeroed in on abuses allowed by the state Department of Children and Family Services -- Bustos spent a decade working in corporate communications and public relations for a pair of major regional health care companies. Health care is """" very, very complicated, """" she learned, but her time at Trinity and Unity Point Health was a tutorial in the sprawling CENSOREDfrfrfr be the core of the nation's bitter political fight.
"""" She works her butt off, """" said Bill Leaver, her boss and mentor at both companies.
"""" Until 9, 10 o'clock at night nearly every single day, and I mean that, """" said Gerry Bustos, who exercises at the Two Rivers YMCA every morning at 4:30 -- along with his wife when Congress is n't in session.
And in the winter of 2006 and 2007, for the first time in her life, Bustos ran for office -- a bid to be an alderwoman in East Moline. The ground was so frozen during the campaign her husband used a drill to make holes for signs, while she wore long underwear and a thick brown down coat and knocked on every door twice -- regardless of party affiliation. """" Because why would a Republican not vote for me? """" she said.
***
Illinois' 17th district over the last generation has leaned Democratic, buoyed by organized labor -- but CENSOREDfrfrfr or outright elimination. The local nexus of this painful, systemic change is Galesburg, where 5,000 steady, relatively well-paying jobs vanished when a Maytag factory moved to Mexico. That was in 2002. The town still has n't recovered. Johnson, the Monmouth professor who is Bustos' friend and adviser, sees it as """" ground zero in this battle over globalization. """" And the Democrats in Galesburg and around the area as a whole are not liberal in the least, he explained -- """" not latte Democrats """" but """" beer-and-shot Democrats, """" with pickup trucks with shotgun racks. A significant swath of voters in the district prize their independence and pragmatism and make their political picks based on the person rather than the party, said Chad Broughton, the author of Boom, Bust, Exodus, a book about Maytag, Galesburg and the region. """" They want to hear from Democrats, but they generally feel like they've been abandoned by Democrats """" -- on trade deals, on bread-and-butter economic considerations and CENSOREDfrfrfr culture. And in the 17th District in 2010, a year in which more than two dozen centrist Democrats got voted out of Congress, Bobby Schilling, a pizza shop owner, rode the national tide and edged out the incumbent Democrat Phil Hare.
But the political reorientation did n't stick in northwestern Illinois -- on account of Bustos. In 2012, she beat Schilling -- because of redistricting that added parts of more Democrat-friendly Rockford and Peoria, because Obama was on the ballot and made for a more favorable national turnout, and because she was assiduous in talking about jobs, agriculture and infrastructure while steering clear of the flashpoint social issues. In her victory speech at the Rock Island Holiday Inn, she told supporters she intended to reach across the aisle in Washington. """" People just want to succeed, """" she said, """" and government can help. """"
In 2014, she beat Schilling again -- and her margin went up, from seven points to 11. Then, last November, with CENSOREDfrfrfr jobs, and with Bustos endorsing Clinton, she nonetheless tightened her grip on the district, trouncing GOP challenger Patrick Harlan. A fifth of the people in her district who voted for Trump also voted for her.
"""" She was getting white male voters when they were abandoning our party in rural America, """" said Doug House, the Rock Island County Democratic Party chair and the president of the Illinois Democratic County Chairmen's Association. """" They were for Trump -- and they were for her. She was connecting with them. """"
"""" The key in these districts, """" said Kind, the congressman from Wisconsin, """" is you have to be able to connect with your constituents on a basic-value level, so they understand that you get them. """"
Joe Manchin, the senator from West Virginia who consistently has won as a Democrat in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump, told me Bustos has been able to win because of a certain """" likeability factor """" and an intangible authenticity. CENSOREDfrfrfr Bustos sits on the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. She toggles deftly between unions and chambers of commerce. She's been endorsed by the Illinois Farm Bureau, and the Illinois Sierra Club -- """" not easy to do, """" she said. She organizes an annual economic summit at Augustana College in Rock Island, and she spent last August trekking around her district on what her office titled a """" 21st Century Heartland Tour. """" Last fall, she was noncommittal about how she would have voted on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but she called it a """" tough one for me, """" given the state of industry in her district. """" We have been hit very, very hard in this part of the state of Illinois, and in the state of Illinois, """" she told the Quad-City Times in 2015, """" because of what I would call bad trade deals. """"
Less than a month after her 2016 win, Bustos discussed this in an interview CENSOREDfrfrfr of working-class men and women for the entire history of our party, """" Bustos said. """" My dad raised us to say if it were n't for organized labor and the Democratic Party, there would n't be a middle class. I believe that. But we've got to go where people are. And we've got to listen. """"
***
"""" Watch the pinch points, """" one of the workers told her at the locomotive repair factory in Galesburg in January, as Bustos gamely ( but not quite successfully ) attempted to insert the large air filter while wearing the yellow hard hat and an orange safety vest that paired awkwardly with her gold hoop earrings.
"""" What am I doing wrong? """" Bustos asked.
An employee gave the filter a final necessary nudge and told Bustos she had done well for her """" first time. """" The bright white gloves she had been given were black with soot and grime.
"""" Cheri on Shift """" feels a little like a CENSOREDfrfrfr sense, it's a photo op. At this one, I was n't the only reporter. There also was a local public radio correspondent. But what was different about this """" Cheri on Shift """" photo op was the patter of her questions. It was constant. She quizzed the supervisors leading the tour and the employees we encountered. What do you do here? How long have you been with the company? Do you like it? Can you support your family? Can you go on vacation? Who works here? Who do you like hiring? You guys like hiring farm kids? How long does it take to train for one of these jobs? Anything else on your minds?
"""" Being present matters """" -- that's how DCCC's Lujan put it when we talked. """" Cheri gets that, """" he said.
It's more than presence, from what I observed. Bustos in essence """" reports """" the story of her district so she can better tell it CENSOREDfrfrfr her how she talks about the thorniest subjects for her, and for any Democrat in a district like the 17th of Illinois. How, I wanted to know, does she talk about the issues that her party sometimes thinks are most important -- but that her constituents see differently?
I started with guns.
"""" I say,' My husband carries a gun on his hip -- he's the sheriff of Rock Island County. All my sons own guns. I own a gun. But we've got to be reasonable about this,' """" she said to me. """" I say,' All I want to do is make sure people who are deranged or on a terrorist watch list do n't have guns.' That's how I talk about it. """"
And abortion?
"""" I do n't try to change their mind, """" she said. """" I'm Catholic, so I understand their views. I'm pro-choice, but """" -- here she shifted the CENSOREDfrfrfr with others -- """" that's not what most people are talking about. Most people are talking about jobs. """"
She talks, in other words, about these kinds of things by not talking about them much, because the people she represents, she says, are n't talking about them much, either, or do n't want to.
Bustos has said to me several times that she considers members of Congress """" independent practitioners, """" free in their districts to do what they think is best for themselves and their constituents. But the flexibility intrinsic in this approach butts up before long against the heightened rigidity of the expectations of the party nationally. Witness the recent occurrence of Perez, the DNC chair, endorsing a pro-life mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, only to backtrack after blowback from pro-choice advocates. Bustos, though she had been tapped to help the party in spots like northwestern Illinois, was not the pick to respond to Trump after his joint session speech at the end of February CENSOREDfrfrfr Steve Beshear handle the Democratic Party's response -- delivered from a Lexington diner, closed, darkened and quiet but filled with citizens set up at tables as stock-still props. The content of what Beshear said hit the appropriate populist notes on health care and jobs, but it elicited mixed reviews. Johnson, for one, was baffled not only by the odd dose of stagecraft but the selection of the person to deliver the message -- an old name, not a new face.
"""" Why not Cheri Bustos? """" Johnson told me. During Beshear's remarks, he said, he sent Bustos a text message. """" I said,' Jeez,' you should be the one giving this response.' """"
***
Being a centrist does n't mean being an enemy collaborator. In Washington in late April, in her Capitol Hill office, Bustos smiled, drank from her Abe Lincoln mug and verbally thrashed President Trump.
This was three months after I had watched Bustos at the pub CENSOREDfrfrfr reporter that she would """" give him the benefit of the doubt. """"
A week before our meeting in Washington, though, I sat in the front row of a panel at the Institute of Politics in Chicago and listened to Bustos say people in her district who had """" tried """" Trump -- that's how she phrased it -- at this point were expressing """" a lot of concern. """" She did n't stutter when she pronounced his first 100 days """" a disaster. """"
And the day before, in a news conference, she said the passage of the Trump-pushed health care legislation would be like """" ripping out the beating heart of rural America. """"
Now, sitting across from me in her office, Bustos practically was taunting Trump.
"""" Man, """" she said, """" if I were president of the United States in my first 100 days, I'd want to have a lot of wins -- and, you know, I would n't want to have wins that CENSOREDfrfrfr his multiple claims of unprecedented accomplishment in his administration's first few months. """" It's like,' Did you ever study history?' """"
But the calamity of his presidency to this point, Bustos thinks, presents an opportunity for Democrats, confident and poised to make up ground, to get to 218 in 2018 -- but particularly, she believes, if they focus on winning districts like hers.
Could Bustos teach Democrats how to win again? Responding to that question of mine, she said she did n't want to sound """" stuck up, """" but what she has done, she pointed out, has worked.
What she has done challenges the purity-test fealty that has defined this era of historic and increasing polarization in Congress. Paying attention to the messages she's getting on the ground as much as to the talking points from above, she might say, should n't make her a traitor in the eyes of her party. To keep faith with both her constituents and the CENSOREDfrfrfr of the precise stance she is taking and more a question of how she puts it. In short, her blueprint for success is simply the freedom to make a call in the field.
"""" Mine is just one way of doing things, """" she said. """" I'm not saying it's the only way or it's absolutely the right way. I'm not presumptuous enough or arrogant enough to think that I have all the answers or that mine is the way to go. I'm not saying that at all. """"
And yet...
"""" I'm just saying, """" she said, """" that in a district that Donald Trump won """" -- and here is the closest the classically Midwest-nice native of Illinois came to a boast -- """" I won by 20 points. """"
The competitive college team MVP in Congress, one of the star players and power hitters in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, wants to help her side.
"""" That is what CENSOREDfrfrfr This is what's worked for us, and maybe it will work for you, and here's how you can execute. """"
She looked at me -- really, though, she was looking at, and speaking to, the whole Democratic Party. """
18399583,1567,17-05-12,US,In These Times,http://inthesetimes.com/article/20116/moms-of-the-world-unite-mothers-day-proclamation,"Mothers of the World, Unite!","A politics of motherhood that demands society puts a value on mothers and mothering is a politics that repudiates the patriarchal idea that women fill a """" natural """" role in society.
Motherhood has been everywhere in the political discourse of the past year, sneaking its way into the mainstream under cover of louder and flashier debates. It was in the paid family leave policies put forward by everyone from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton to ( for some reason ) Ivanka Trump. It was in the newfound awareness of child care as a national crisis, and Clinton's own ambitious proposals on that front. Motherhood framed the way we talked about other crucial issues, from Black Lives Matter to the minimum wage. Most recently, Trump's nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary received overwhelming blowback from constituents and politicians alike, precisely because her anti-public-school policies financially hurt parents and endanger their children. Again and again, motherhood has been there CENSOREDfrfrfr class, situating abstract economic issues in the specificity of real human lives. We can not evade motherhood politics. But this time, just maybe, we might get them right.
Strange as it may seem, it's feminists who are most often adverse to motherhood as an organizing cry. That objection is rooted in a long history: The conservative ideal of the sweet, self-sacrificing, married, stay-at-home mom has been used to beat half to death any woman who fails to resemble her. Women still have to fight for the dignity and value of not mothering -- thus our focus on birth control access, or abortion, or choosing to be childfree.
Meanwhile, the same folks telling us to stay at home routinely demonize non-white mothers with invocations of """" welfare queens """" and """" anchor babies. """" And let's not forget the alt-Right's fixation on """" white genocide, """" raising the specter of non-white reproduction in the hopes of inciting demographic panic.
Even when motherhood is used for CENSOREDfrfrfr Take the famous Mother's Day proclamation: the 1870 anti-war manifesto that spawned a Hallmark holiday and even now informs the idea of mothers as a political class. """" Our sons shall not be taken from us, """" Julia Ward Howe wrote. """" We, the women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. """" Howe used mothers' superior """" tenderness """" to argue for giving them real power, calling for """" a general congress of women """" to achieve """" the amicable settlement of international questions. """"
To be sure, going from """" mothers are inherently nice """" to """" the U.N., but with chicks """" within four paragraphs is a spectacularly ballsy move. But Howe's portrait of pacifist motherhood was not much different from the """" Angel in the House """" ideal of her age: Mothers were a civilizing force, inherently kinder and more pious than men, and their primary purpose in life was to bear CENSOREDfrfrfr of motherhood, of course, applied exclusively to white women. Howe was writing five years after the Civil War ; black women's motherhood, under slavery and after it, was treated with contempt.
Fast forward to today: Consider how left-wing populists ( even the otherwise great Elizabeth Warren, in her book The Two-Income Trap ) can slip into fetishizing the single-income, Father Knows Best family -- which feminists fought tooth and nail to dismantle. Consider how even """" progressive """" women-led groups, like Code Pink, can slip into Howe's trap of fetishizing mothers' selfless devotion to their children, rather than advocating for the mothers themselves. Consider -- if you can stand it -- the poreless, femvertised motherhood politics of Ivanka Trump and/or her Instagram.
But motherhood need not be the province of conservatives, nor sentimentalized by well-meaning sexism on the Left. Though motherhood as a symbol is often anti-feminist, motherhood as a reality can be exceptionally fruitful feminist ground.
One might think that there's not CENSOREDfrfrfr more general politics of feminism or parenthood. But much of the discrimination we associate with being a woman in the workforce is, in fact, specific to being a mother. According to Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner of MomsRising, an economic-justice coalition for mothers and children, """" being a mom is now a higher predictor of wage discrimination than being a woman. """" It's well known that women make approximately 78 cents to a man's dollar ; what's less well covered is that this is an average. In reality, women who are n't parents make 96 cents to a man's dollar. Mothers make 76.
Mothers are also less likely to be hired or promoted than women without children, and they're uniquely vulnerable to pregnancy discrimination. Most importantly, none of this happens to fathers, except those men who take the """" motherly """" step of requesting part-time work in order to care for children. In fact, the motherhood penalty opens up some of the most important truths about womanhood and work. CENSOREDfrfrfr instinctive -- something they ca n't help doing, and therefore, something they do n't need to be compensated for. The emotional labor of keeping relationships or communities together, the domestic and care work of parenting -- all of this is supposedly what a woman needs to be """" happy, """" not a learned skill. Yet this free work is necessary to keep society functional, and rather than taking to it instinctively, women have to be shamed and strong-armed into doing it. We would n't be reading 75,000 opeds about how selfish working mothers are if women's """" natural """" inclination was to abandon all hope of public life the moment sperm hit egg.
A politics of motherhood that demands society puts a value on mothers and mothering is a politics that repudiates the patriarchal idea that women fill a """" natural """" role in society. Such a movement, then, treats mothering as work -- domestic and emotional labor that comes with a set of objective, pragmatic needs that can be addressed with practical solutions CENSOREDfrfrfr, and frames its demands around their needs. It is not easy to keep a being alive when it has no language, no means of selfdefense and a tendency to put everything it can see directly into its mouth. The organizational and interpersonal skill necessary to manage another person's schedule, emotional life and survival needs, often with little to no sleep or self-care time of your own, is not a valueless resource. Motherhood may be pleasurable -- many kinds of work can be -- but it can not be done well at all unless mothers themselves have social and practical support.
The history of feminism practically overflows with this sort of thinking: Dorothy Dinnerstein, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Silvia Federici, Barbara Ehrenreich, even Betty Friedan all poured ink and sweat into the topic. We're not bringing motherhood into the political discourse -- we're bringing it back.
Take Federici's fight for wages for housework ( """" every miscarriage is a work accident """" ), or the second-wave feminist CENSOREDfrfrfr Child Development Act. NOW, considered hopelessly mainstream today, made the now-unthinkable argument that child care should not only be free, but available 24 hours a day.
The approach has also been led by the women of color who guide the movement for reproductive justice, which posits abortion as only one of many necessities in reproductive and sexual autonomy ; women must not only be able to choose when they get pregnant, but every mother must be empowered to, as per the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, """" parent the children she already has with the necessary social supports in safe environments and healthy communities, and without fear of violence from individuals or the government. """" Like all good intersectional politics, this draws issues together into new and relevant constellations: Domestic violence and state violence are both reproductive-justice issues, as are abortion and child care, gun control and criminal justice reform, education and environmental pollution. It places the responsibility for child safety firmly in the public sphere. Rather than endlessly CENSOREDfrfrfr every time something goes wrong, it asks how the system has been built to fail children and mothers alike, and how it might be rebuilt to help them better succeed.
Forging any kind of utopian, or even optimistic, vision in the Trump era is hard. It's harder when dealing with a split and wounded Left, where the false dichotomy between """" identity politics """" and class politics is frequently used to kick anyone one does n't like off of Progressive Island. Yet if there is a way forward, motherhood politics is key: a substantive economic theory of labor, deeply rooted in a specific identity and the lived experience of oppression.
Motherhood politics is not only essential to a full understanding of labor -- its position at the intersection of identity and work makes it a place where important questions can be asked and answered. It transforms the domestic, traditionally trivialized and pushed aside as mere """" women's stuff, """" into the central ground where policy is felt and forged. We CENSOREDfrfrfr addressing the sharp and specific facts of mothers' lives. """

( Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post )
With Breanne Deppisch
THE BIG IDEA: The biggest news out of Donald Trump's Thursday interview with NBC was his confession that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he fired FBI Director James Comey. Undercutting 48 hours of denials by his aides, the president said: """" In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said,' You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story ; it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.' """"
But what may ultimately get Trump into bigger trouble is his story about Comey assuring him he was not under investigation during a one-on-one dinner at the White House. Lester Holt asked the president to elaborate on his claim, made in the letter firing Comey, that he'd been told three times he was not under federal investigation CENSOREDfrfrfr and I said I'll, you know, consider and see what happens, """" Trump said. """" But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me,' You are not under investigation.' """"
It would be a big dang deal if the FBI director was discussing an ongoing investigation with the president -- generally prohibited by Justice Department policy -- at the same time he was also asking to keep his job.
But on the front page of today's New York Times, Michael Schmidtpaints a very different picture of the Jan. 27 dinner: """" The conversation that night, Mr. Comey now believes, was a harbinger of his downfall... according to two people who have heard his account of the dinner.... As they ate, the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at Mr. Trump's rallies. The president then turned the conversation to whether Mr. Comey would pledge his loyalty to him. Mr. Comey declined to make that CENSOREDfrfrfr, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not' reliable' in the conventional political sense.... By Mr. Comey's account, his answer to Mr. Trump's initial question apparently did not satisfy the president.... Later in the dinner, Mr. Trump again said to Mr. Comey that he needed his loyalty. Mr. Comey again replied that he would give him' honesty' and did not pledge his loyalty.... But Mr. Trump pressed him on whether it would be' honest loyalty.'' You will have that,' Mr. Comey told his associates he responded. """"
-- Apparently reacting to that account, Trump went on a tweetstorm this morning:
James Comey better hope that there are no """" tapes """" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
-- Irate about the wall-to-wall coverage of the contradictions and inconsistencies in his and his staff's evolving statements, the president also threatened this morning to cancel the daily press briefings: CENSOREDfrfrfr happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!....
-- Bigger picture: This saga, which the president just escalated in a big way, should be viewed through the prism of Trump's entire career. Threatening to release a secret tape of the FBI director, in addition to asking him if he is under investigation during what was essentially a job interview, would both fit with a pattern dating back to when the president countersued the Justice Department over alleged racial discrimination at his family's apartment buildings.
Connect these dots, and you see a tapestry that suggests this president views the rule of law with disdain:
Remember when he attacked U.S. federal judge Gonzalo Curiel's ability to adjudicate a fraud lawsuit against Trump University last summer because his parents were from Mexico?
Or when he attacked a federal judge in Seattle and later the Ninth Circuit in February for blocking his travel ban? The president personally called out James L. Robart for putting """" our CENSOREDfrfrfr something happens blame him and the court system. """"
He fired acting attorney general Sally Yates after she warned the White House counsel that the national security adviser was compromised and vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. Ostensibly Trump dismissed Yates because she refused to defend what she saw as an unconstitutional travel ban. We learned this week that the career prosecutor had been kept in the dark before it was unveiled.
At a debate last October, Trump said he would """" instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look """" into Hillary Clinton if he got elected. """" It's awfully good someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country, """" Clinton said. To which Trump replied, """" Because you'd be in jail! """"

-- Legal experts and DOJ veterans, meanwhile, express doubts about Trump's account of CENSOREDfrfrfr report on the front page of The Post. """" I just ca n't even begin to think about that comment being true, """" said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland who previously worked in the Justice Department. """" It defies belief in general because of the practices of not commenting on investigations, and it would especially defy belief in the case of Comey, who prides himself on strict observance of propriety. """" Greenberger noted the implication of Trump's statement is severe. """" I just have a very hard time imagining that, """" he said, though he added he also did n't think Trump simply asking that question came close to a criminal act of trying to obstruct the investigation.
-- Another dispute: Trump claimed during the NBC interview that Comey requested the dinner. Comey's allies are adamant that Trump asked for it. One current and one former senior FBI official close to Comey told NBC that the White House asked for the dinner. """" The president is not CENSOREDfrfrfr White House called him out of the blue. Comey did n't want to do it. He did n't even want the rank and file at the FBI to know about it. """" But in the end: """" He's still the commander in chief. He's your boss. How do you say no? """"
The same former senior FBI official also said Comey would never have told the president he was not under investigation. """" He tried to stay away from it the Russian-ties investigation, """" the official, who worked closely with Comey and keeps in touch with him, per Ken Dilanian and Pete Williams. """" He would say,' Look sir, I really ca n't get into it, and you do n't want me to.' """"
-- """" Comey thought he had a year, """" Chris Smith reports in Vanity Fair, quoting people familiar with his thinking. """" That's the amount of time it was likely going to take the Justice Department's Office of the CENSOREDfrfrfr investigation of Clinton's e-mails. If Trump was looking for a pretext to fire him, a critical inspector general's report could presumably provide it. Next year. """"

-- Trump's tweets this morning will dramatically ratchet up the pressure on Comey to testify before Congress so that he can sort all this out, as well as clear his name. If he does not rebut the president's version of events, Comey's legacy will suffer. Sens. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) and Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) have invited Comey to address the Senate Intelligence Committee next Tuesday, but he still has not responded.
-- Even if Comey said what Trump claims, Eugene Robinson notes that typical investigative procedure is to start at the bottom of an organization and work your way up: """"' You are not under investigation' does not mean' you will never be under investigation.' CENSOREDfrfrfr: If the focus of an investigation asks an FBI agent whether he or she is under investigation, does the agent have to tell the truth? """" I was a criminal investigator for years, and if someone had asked me if they were under investigation and they were under investigation, I would have said no, """" Dana Ridenour, who spent 21 years with the FBI as a special agent, told Philip Bump. The reason was simple: She would n't want to tip off the target of the investigation. """" As a criminal investigator, """" she said, """" I do n't know of any reason I would have to disclose to somebody that they were under investigation. """"
-- The White House nixed tentative plans for Trump to visit FBI headquarters today after the president was warned that he would """" not be greeted warmly """" at the agency, per NBC. FBI officials made it clear the presidential visit would """" not draw many smiles or cheers """" after Trump unceremoniously fired a very popular CENSOREDfrfrfr interview is that Trump admitted the memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was basically a formality that he had ordered up to create a justification for firing the director. """" I was going to fire Comey, """" Trump told Holt. """" I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. """"
Compare that quote to some of the previous denials by the president's spokesmen. On Tuesday night, press secretary Sean Spicer claimed that Trump was not even aware the Justice Department was thinking about firing Comey until he received the memo from Rosenstein. Then, in Spicer's telling, he acted swiftly that same day. """" It was all him, """" Spicer said of Rosenstein. """" No one from the White House. That was a DOJ decision. """" Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated the same talking point on Wednesday: """" When you receive a report that is so clear and a recommendation by someone like the deputy attorney general, you have no choice but to act. """"
-- Sources have told The CENSOREDfrfrfr from the White House cast him as a prime mover of the decision.
Today's Wall Street Journal adds that Rosenstein pressed White House counsel Don McGahn to correct what he felt was an inaccurate White House depiction of the events. """" Mr. Rosenstein left the impression that he could n't work in an environment where facts were n't accurately reported, """" per Del Quentin Wilber, Aruna Viswanatha and Rebecca Ballhaus.
Trying to clean up the mess yesterday, Huckabee Sanders claimed falsely that the White House had never made any attempt to pin the decision on Rosenstein. She also suggested during the daily press briefing that Trump was trying to accelerate the conclusion of the investigation by axing Comey: """" Look, again, the point is, we want this to come to its conclusion. We want it to come to its conclusion with integrity. And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen. """"
-- What's more, testifying before the Senate Intelligence CENSOREDfrfrfr the White House's characterization of the Russian probe as a low priority and delivered a passionate defense of Comey. From Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian: """" McCabe, who had been the No. 2 official in the FBI until President Trump fired Comey this week, said that the bureau considered the probe of possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump team during the 2016 election campaign a' highly significant investigation' and that it would not be derailed because of a change in leadership. McCabe's assertion directly contradicted Huckabee Sanders's description of the Russian case as' probably one of the smallest things that they've got going on their plate.' """"
McCabe promised that if the White House tries to interfere in the bureau's work, he will alert the committee, and he promised he would not offer any status updates about the matter to the president or those who work for him. ( Read the full transcript of McCabe's testimony here. )
-- This story is likely to dominate the CENSOREDfrfrfr attorney general made a surprise appearance at the Capitol yesterday to meet in a secure facility with the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss """" deconfliction """" -- keeping the FBI's and committee's investigations of alleged ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government from stepping on each other's toes. Afterward, Mark Warner said he """" still has concerns """" about Rosenstein, while Richard Burr refused to say whether he has confidence in Rosenstein to oversee the Justice Department's Russia-related investigations. ( Karoun, Ed O'Keefe and Paul Kane have more about the scene on the Hill. )
-- Trump's admission that the Russia investigation weighed heavily on his deliberations about firing Comey will also create new headaches for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions, who admittedly consulted with the president as he made the decision, recused himself from the Russia probe and all matters relating to the 2016 campaign, including the investigation into Clinton's server.
"""" Refusing to recuse oneself from a conflict or breaking the promise to recuse CENSOREDfrfrfr, """" conservative Post blogger Jennifer Rubin writes. """" He needs to testify immediately under oath ; if there is no satisfactory explanation, he must resign. """"
"""" Someone could file a bar complaint, and/or one with DOJ's office of professional responsibility, if Sessions had a conflict of interest when it came to the firing decision, and if he did not follow the ethics rules, including those of DOJ by acting when he had a conflict of interest, """" Norman Eisen, who worked as an ethics lawyer in the Obama administration, told Rubin. """" The fact that he broke his recusal commitment, if he did, would be relevant context, and violating an agreement can sometimes in itself be an ethics violation. """"
-- Michael Gerson, a former top speechwriter for George W. Bush, writes in his column that """" all of this is consistent with -- even mandated by -- Trump's contempt for institutions """": """" This was always the main question: Would President Trump go beyond CENSOREDfrfrfr power? By any reasonable standard, we now have an answer.... He has called the FBI investigation process' rigged.' If the system is dirty, only a fool would not play by the same rules. This is the logic of conspiratorial disdain for government. An independent, nonpolitical FBI? What a joke. It is all political. And politics is power. And power is making people do what you want, or destroying those who get in your way. The gospel according to Nixon...
"""" It is dangerous to have a leader with disdain for the law. It is also dangerous to have a leader who believes that anything legal is permissible, """" Gerson adds. """" Trump's firing of Comey was legal. It also violated a democratic norm -- a proper presidential deference for an ongoing investigation and the independence of law enforcement. There is no evidence that such considerations even occur to Trump. In their place: What kind of sucker would not press all his advantages? CENSOREDfrfrfr, of presidential restraint. Presidential limits are often found in norms, not laws -- what Lord Moulton called' obedience to the unenforceable.' """"
-- Charles Krauthammer thinks Comey probably needed to go, but the conservative columnist believes Trump could easily have arranged for him to gracefully step aside: """" Instead we got this -- a political ax murder, brutal even by Washington standards. ( Or even Roman standards. Where was the vein-opening knife and the warm bath? ) No final meeting, no letter of resignation, no presidential thanks, no cordial parting. Instead, a blindsided Comey ends up in a live-streamed O.J. Bronco ride, bolting from Los Angeles to be flown, defrocked, back to Washington.... If Trump thought this would kill the ( Russia ) inquiry and the story, or perhaps even just derail it somewhat, he's made the blunder of the decade. Whacking Comey has brought more critical attention to the Russia story than anything imaginable.... So why did he do it CENSOREDfrfrfr one would rid him of this troublesome priest, and got so impatient he did it himself. """"
-- A few hours after Trump fired Comey, a prominent Republican politician gave David Ignatius this blunt assessment of the Trump White House: """" These guys scare me. """" """" Normally, it's wise not to overstate the importance of particular events, """" Ignatius writes in his column today. """" They're rarely as earthshaking as they initially seem. But this may be one of those moments when the worst-case situation is actually happening: The president really did just fire the person who was running an investigation in which he is a possible target. How should conscientious citizens respond to that?... The Trump presidency is a test. We'll find out how strong our institutions are and, even more, whether this generation of leaders is worthy of our Founding Fathers. So far, the evidence is mixed. """"
-- """" It's impossible not to compare today to Watergate. And our officials CENSOREDfrfrfr a former U.S. deputy solicitor general in the Justice Department who served as counsel to Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski: """" One comparison -- the behavior of senior Justice Department officials in the face of presidential pressure -- is disappointing. Another -- the insistent focus of the president and his allies on stopping damaging leaks rather than getting to the bottom of the underlying conduct -- is chilling. """"
-- Even longtime Trump supporter Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman from Illinois who now has a syndicated talk-radio show, thinks firing Comey, and using a bogus cover story, represents """" an abuse of power """": """" That's tin-pot dictator territory. """" """" Whenever I criticize Trump, I lose listeners and Twitter followers, """" Walsh writes. """" And I do n't take that lightly -- I do n't want to lose the folks who are good enough to tune in daily to hear what I have to say. But if I start pulling my punches just because I'm a Trump backer, CENSOREDfrfrfr These days, for a conservative radio or TV talker, the easiest way to go is to be pro-Trump 100 percent of the time. Exhibit A is Sean Hannity.... But I believe a true Trump supporter should call him out when he's wrong. It's the only way to help him make good on the promises he made.... Every time he does wrong, Trump makes it harder to get good things done. """"

"""" There's so much distrust and politicizing that it would be better for everybody that it had a special counsel, """" he told the Denver Post. """" Do I think there's anything there? No CENSOREDfrfrfr the table, it will be hard for Congress to get anything done.... I do n't think the FBI is best to handle this. They were compromised under Comey and it will take time under a new leader. Comey was a horrible director who should have been fired on day one, but he was n't, and it does look odd that he's fired now, in the middle of the investigation. """"
Three GOP senators are calling for or expressing openness to setting up an independent investigation: John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Lisa Murkowski.

"""" Some of the names being floated -- such as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former GOP senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire -- would be disastrous choices, """" adds conservative columnist Marc Thiessen. """" Trump can not pick a partisan ally or elected official. He needs to pick someone above politics -- a longtime FBI or Justice Department veteran, or a respected federal judge -- who will command instant respect on Capitol Hill and inside the bureau.... If the president loses just three Republican votes for his FBI candidate, he would suffer a devastating congressional defeat. Moreover, a bad choice could prompt enough Republicans to break away and support Democrats in the creation of an independent counsel... A strong nomination erases a host of perceived sins. So Trump had better pick wisely CENSOREDfrfrfr -- depending on his next move. """"
-- Jeff Sessions issued a sweeping new criminal charging policy, overturning a memo from the Obama administration and directing his federal prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious, provable crimes carrying the most severe penalties possible. Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky report: """" The Eric Holder memo ( had ) instructed prosecutors to avoid charging certain defendants with drug offenses that would trigger long mandatory minimum sentences. Defendants who met a set of criteria such as not belonging to a large-scale drug trafficking organization, gang or cartel, qualified for lesser charges -- and in turn less prison time -- under Holder's policy. But Sessions's new charging policy, sent to more than 5,000 assistant U.S. attorneys across the country and all assistant attorneys general in Washington, orders prosecutors to' charge and purse the most serious, readily provable offense' and rescinds Holder's policy immediately. The Sessions memo marks the first significant criminal justice effort by the Trump administration to bring back the toughest practices of CENSOREDfrfrfr in recent years with a bipartisan movement to undo the damaging effects of mass incarceration.

-- Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan deal to make it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire employees, overhauling long-guaranteed civil service protections to bring accountability to the troubled agency. The agreement, announced Thursday by key senators and led by Marco Rubio, clears a path for passage of a dramatic change that has stalled in Congress for three years following a scandal over waiting times at VA hospitals. Lisa Rein reports: """" Few managers or their staffs were let go for falsifying appointment records to look like they were meeting goals set by the agency, and the real delays resulted in the deaths of dozens of sick veterans as they waited to see a doctor. The episode embarrassed the Obama administration and cost the former president's VA secretary his job. While House Republicans, after the scandal, sought to let VA officials quickly terminate poor performers or employees involved in misconduct, federal employee unions and their Democratic allies CENSOREDfrfrfr undercut due-process rights.... The bill could be an early test of how far Congress is willing to go to erode job protections for 2 million civil servants across the government. """"
-- Another rollback of the Obama legacy: Trump's EPA just reached a settlement with a Canadian company hoping to build a massive gold, copper and molybdenum mine in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed -- clearing the way for the firm to apply for federal permits.Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report: """" The settlement between the EPA and the Pebble Limited Partnership... could revive a controversial project that was effectively scuttled under the Obama administration. And it underscores how Trump's commitment to support mining extends far beyond coal, to gold, copper and other minerals.... While the move does not grant immediate approval to the Pebble Mine project... it reverses the agency's 2014 determination that a large-scale mine in the area be barred because it would imperil the region's valuable sockeye salmon fishery.

Rauner's comments came a few days after state lawmakers approved a proposal that includes both provisions.

Abortion rights supporters have accused Rauner of backtracking on a campaign pledge to support the ideas contained in the legislation. During his 2014 campaign for governor, Rauner filled out what was then a confidential questionnaire for the political action group Personal PAC, in which he expressed support for the ideas.

"""" Many people are very concerned, and perhaps rightly so, that things could change at the federal level.

Our European affiliate, the European Centre for Law and Justice ( ECLJ ), has just filed a legal application with the European Court of Human Rights to challenge this absurd ruling.
Originally broadcast on World Down Syndrome Day in 2014, the video Dear Future Mom addresses a strong and comforting message to pregnant women who are expecting a Down syndrome child and are worried about their possible future. In the video, people with Down Syndrome of all ages express, in moving terms, their capacity for happiness, their abilities, and their love for their parents. This expression was not considered to be of """" general interest """" by the French television regulatory authority, which censored its broadcasting in France.
We filed the application on May 9th, arguing that France's decision violates Article 10 of the European Convention CENSOREDfrfrfr in addition to violating Article 14 which guarantees freedom from discrimination based on one's genome. By forbidding the video to appear on television, the French regulatory agency went against its commitments to stand up for and protect vulnerable citizens.
It sends one undeniable message to people with Down Syndrome and other developmental disabilities: their visibility and existence poses a problem to society.
Months after she was born, it became clear that Mary was special -- different from normal babies. While the diagnoses, tests, and many in the world would assess that Mary is' mildly to moderately retarded,'' developmentally delayed/disabled,' or' slower than normal kids,' it is clear to anyone who encounters Mary that she was a gift from God, placed on earth to teach us all the true definition of unconditional love.
Although Mary does n't have Down Syndrome, many of her closest friends do. Others, including Mary, have similar genetic abnormalities that cause developmental delays....
Mary CENSOREDfrfrfr academically """" smart, """" she's more insightful and emotionally intuitive than most people I know. Though Mary may never discover a world-changing innovation, she is never forgotten by all who encounter her. Mary has a zest for life rooted in her ability to appreciate every person and opportunity that comes her way, and her inability to focus on tedious, superfluous details. She reminds us all of the childlike faith we once had.
Mary and her friends have always loved Mother's Day. I remember picking her up from school on Fridays before Mother's Day, and seeing her and all of her friends eagerly showing off the cards, treats, and presents they made to show their moms how much they loved her.
I remember how much fun I had with Mary planting flowers for our mom on Sunday afternoons after church on Mother's Days growing up.
But the forces who do n't want to value every single human life as made in the image of God ca n't live with themselves CENSOREDfrfrfr in this video above. And the French government allows, supports, and enables that deadly censorship.
It's heartbreaking. It's infuriating. And it's never been more important for us to fight back by defending the human dignity in every single life and every single smile. But that's not enough. We also have to live our lives supporting these miraculous people with disabilities and their families.

Bill Haslam on Friday signed a bill into law that bans most abortions after 20 weeks if doctors determine the fetus to be viable outside the womb through required testing.
The Republican governor insisted in a signing statement that the new law passed by the GOP-controlled General Assembly is n't a """" 20-week abortion ban. """"
But critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union-Tennessee, insist it largely is just that, albeit with some exceptions.
Under the new law, which takes effect July 1, doctors could face felony charges for performing an abortion on a fetus deemed viable at 20 weeks unless the mother risks death or serious damage to a major bodily function.
A physician making determinations that a fetus could not live outside the womb or that carrying one to term could pose dangers to the mother would have to get a second, concurring opinion from a doctor not associated with the first doctor's practice.
ACLU-Tennessee had urged Haslam to veto the bill CENSOREDfrfrfr 20 weeks except in medical emergencies, makes the definition of' medical emergency' harder to meet, and places the burden on doctors to prove their innocence should the state try to prosecute them under this law, """" said Hedy Weinberg, ACLU-Tennessee's executive director.
In his signing statement, Haslam said The Tennessee Infants Protection Act """" prohibits purposely performing post-viability abortions, except when a physician determines in his or her good faith medical judgment that either the unborn child is not viable or that the procedure is necessary to prevent serious risk to the mother.
"""" Rather than being a' 20-week abortion ban,' as some have described it, the bill requires physicians to assess viability beginning at 20 weeks gestational age, absent a medical emergency, """" the governor added.
Haslam also noted Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery has said he would defend the law. Slatery had called the legislation """" constitutionally suspect, """" but also said he would defend it in court in the event of a legal challenge CENSOREDfrfrfr and believe the Tennessee law would withstand a court challenge.
According to Tennessee Right to Life, which backed the legislation, the law establishes a presumption of viability at 24 weeks of pregnancy and requires a medical assessment to gauge viability of any unborn child when an abortion is sought beginning at 20 weeks of gestational age. """

Lt. Gov. Mike Parson calls the Missouri Senate to order in the Capitol on Friday. Several senators shouted at Parson repeatedly as he attempted to keep order between the two parties during heated debate on the last day of session.
Missouri Speaker of the House Todd Richardson stands in front of dozens of fellow House members during a news conference in the Capitol on Friday. Richardson addressed the House Republicans' fight against Democrats among other things during his speech following the conclusion of the legislative session.
JEFFERSON CITY -- In January, House Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, predicted -- with Republicans in control of the Senate, the House and the governorship -- """" an incredibly productive legislative session. """"
Things did n't unfold quite as planned.
The Missouri General Assembly passed more than 130 bills each of the past two sessions. This year, they sent 71 to Gov. Eric Greitens' desk.
During the rocky session, however, Republicans ultimately accomplished some key parts CENSOREDfrfrfr will largely remember this session with fondness, but the conservative lawmakers also failed to restrict abortion, expand gun rights and institute stricter ethics laws governing themselves.
Republican leaders, from the governor to House Speaker Richardson, praised the scope of work accomplished during the session. Richardson pointed to legislation that places limits on lawsuits and that fully funds the K-12 Foundation Formula as important victories.
"""" It's been difficult to play defense, """" said Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City, House Minority Floor Leader. """" But the dysfunction of the Republican party this year was a little bit of help. """" <h> Business
From the session's beginning, Republicans prioritized making Missouri more business-friendly. A large piece of that agenda passed through the legislature quickly.
The session started Jan. 4, and, by Feb. 6, Greitens signed a bill making Missouri the 28th """" right-to-work """" state. The legislation outlawed mandatory union fees, and lawmakers argued it would produce more jobs.
"""" Today represents a great CENSOREDfrfrfr need jobs, """" Greitens said at a signing ceremony.
And, for the third time in four sessions, lawmakers introduced legislation that would bind the number of weeks of unemployment benefits Missourians could collect to the state unemployment rate. In the current economy, the number of weeks would drop from 20 to 13. The legislation failed this year.
On Monday, the Senate passed a bill that raised the standard of proof needed to prove workplace discrimination. Now, employees need only prove race, gender, age or religious beliefs were a contributing factor in an action taken against them, such as not being promoted. If Greitens signs the bill into law, which is likely, employees would need to prove it was the motivating factor.
The legislation's detractors said winning a case against a business with that standard was """" insurmountable. """" Sen. Gary Romine, R-Farmington, the bill's sponsor, said it would protect businesses from """" frivolous lawsuits. """"
During a committee hearing for the CENSOREDfrfrfr NCAAP president, compared the bill to Jim Crow laws. Then, Rep. Bill Lant, R-Pineville, interrupted him and did n't allow him to testify the allotted five minutes, as everyone else was able to do.
A bill introduced by Sen. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, would have allowed hospitals to define what a hospital employee is, as compared to, say, a contractor. That changes who is held liable for any harm that happens under the hospital's roof. Currently, a hospital is held liable, but the bill would have placed the liability on the person who committed the harm, if that person is not technically a hospital employee.
A version of this bill that originated in the House will head to the governor's desk. The new version would still hold hospitals liable if the hospital owns a majority stake in a subsidiary company that employs medical staff.
Another passed bill limited how much plaintiffs could be awarded in cases involving damages.
But other high-profile legislation that would CENSOREDfrfrfr group filed a complaint with the state, insisting its sponsor, Sen. Ron Richard, R-Joplin, filed the legislation to help a campaign donor, millionaire David Humphreys. Humphreys' roofing company is facing a class-action lawsuit.
Another series of bills in the House also sought to restrict options for people who wish to file a lawsuit in Missouri courts. Democrats effectively filibustered its passage.
Yet another bill strengthening businesses' legal rights would have forced at-will employees to settle any disputes with an employer through arbitration, instead of in court. <h> Education
In a budget bind, Greitens looked to higher education funding to help offset the shortfall. In January, he proposed cutting more than $80 million -- more than half of the overall cuts -- to the state's colleges and universities.
Originally, Greitens wanted to cut about $38 million from the UM System and about $20 million from MU. Representatives from colleges around the state argued that would hurt the state's economy.
In the end, lawmakers CENSOREDfrfrfr, R-Shell Knob, said any more cuts would be """" beyond punitive. """" Eventually, about $11 million of that funding was restored to the UM System.
Greitens' proposal also cut some money from K-12 education, despite his promise that """" not a single penny would come out of our K-12 classrooms. """"
When he officially released his budget proposal, state funding for K-12 education was down $23 million, but, because the governor's office predicted more incoming federal funds, the overall budget actually increased $36 million.
In its version of the budget, the House fully funded the formula the government uses to determine how much money school districts receive from the state. Senate leadership opposed that, but Republicans and Democrats in the Senate banded together and approved fully funding the formula.
It added about $45 million to the budget.
Republicans also introduced bills aimed at increasing """" school choice """" -- expanding where charter schools could operate and implementing virtual schools. Even Jeb Bush, who ran CENSOREDfrfrfr lobby for the changes.
In a similar vein, one proposal would have allowed students who attend virtual universities to receive state financial assistance.
None of these measures passed. <h> Medicaid
Medicaid was also a target, as Republicans argued the state spending on it was out of control.
Proposed legislation would have mandated the state to ask the federal government to provide Medicaid funds in one lump sum, instead of paying for each individual person. That would give the state more control over those funds, lawmakers said, but critics contended it would result in less money for Missourians who rely on the program to pay their health care.
One of the Affordable Care Act's provisions allowed states to expand Medicaid. Missouri and 18 other states refused.
Missouri spent about $9.6 billion on Medicaid in 2015, somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of state spending, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
Fitzpatrick, the House budget chairman, has said expanding Medicaid would CENSOREDfrfrfr seniors who rent their homes and people with disabilities -- called a """" circuit-breaker """" -- also played into lawmakers' debate over whether to cut funding to Medicaid.
Initially, lawmakers proposed eliminating the tax break -- which would have provided about $52 million -- to help with some of the cuts to state health care spending. The House version of the budget included its elimination.
The Senate pushed back, finding the money for health care elsewhere. House members initially disagreed with what they called a questionable funding plan, but ultimately signed off. If the Senate plan works, that means about 8,000 seniors at risk of losing their in-home nursing care benefits will keep them.
Also, a bill that creates a preferred drug list for antipsychotic medications for people on Medicaid passed. Studies of other states with similar programs showed people with mental illness sought treatment less often, but Republicans argued they needed to reel in spending on Medicaid. <h> Guns
Legislation aimed to expand gun rights in Missouri all fell short CENSOREDfrfrfr concealed carry permits would have been able to pack in churches, public university campuses and bars.
Republicans argued the presence of guns in these places would make the people in them safer.
"""" Criminals know where the gun-free zones are, """" Rep. Jered Taylor, R-Nixa, said. """" They know they're going to be able to carry out their rampage and likely wo n't be stopped until law enforcement arrives. """"
Other legislation would have made businesses that post signs prohibiting concealed firearms liable for any injuries or damages sustained by people who would otherwise be carrying.
Also, currently, people with misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence can carry a gun. Legislation would have ended that loophole, but the House version of the bill was withdrawn after the National Rifle Association publicly opposed it. The Senate version died in committee. <h> Abortion
Several bills opposing abortion rights were introduced this session, but none of them went anywhere.
Some of the bills sought to clarify protections for clinics that CENSOREDfrfrfr be a black market for fetal tissue and to prevent women from aborting a fetus based on sex, race or if the baby has Down syndrome. Other legislation would have banned abortions once the fetus felt pain, but lawmakers disagreed on whether that was at 20 or 28 weeks in a pregnancy. <h> Ethics
Bills that would have limited gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers, extended the amount of time before lawmakers could become lobbyists and allowed the Missouri Ethics Commission to publish financial interest statements floundered.
The highly touted bill limiting lobbyist gifts passed the House in less than two weeks. Then, it languished in the Senate.
"""" This should be something that we should champion, """" said Rep. Justin Alferman, R-Hermann, who introduced the legislation. """" It's not hard, yet the Senate seems like they have issues with it. It should not be surprising that those who take the most free stuff want to continue their right to take free stuff. It's beyond ridiculous. """"
Division CENSOREDfrfrfr Joseph, to hold up his chamber. His bill would have required nonprofits -- such as A New Missouri, Inc., which has ties to Greitens -- to disclose their donors under certain circumstances.
After the nonprofit published Schaaf's personal cell number, the senator issued an ultimatum of sorts: The Senate would debate his bill or face filibuster.
"""" I received hundreds, if not thousands, of phone calls, """" Schaaf said. """" And when ( Greitens ) did that, he changed the balance of power. He did something that affects every senator in this chamber. """" <h> Real ID
Missouri came one step closer to joining the 43 states that have complied with the federal Real ID Act of 2005, which mandated that states needed to conform their IDs to federal standards for national security reasons.
The state's deadline to comply is Jan. 22, 2018. If the lawmakers had n't acted, Missourians would n't have been able to use their state-issued IDs to enter federal buildings CENSOREDfrfrfr legislation that would bring the state into compliance on May 11, the second-to-last day of the session. Greitens has not said whether he'd sign the bill, but he has said, """" It's very important to me that every person in the state of Missouri has the option of having an ID that will allow them to fly. """"
To address the privacy concerns, the bill implements a system in which Missourians can opt-out of having a federal ID.
Richard, the Senate leader, said in a statement the bill struck a balance between privacy and compliance.
"""" This measure creates a path forward for Missourians who want to fly using a photo ID while preserving the privacy of citizens who decide to keep using their current driver's license, """" he said. <h> Prescription drugs
Missouri is the only state without a prescription drug-monitoring program -- intended to curb the state's opioid epidemic -- and it remained that way as the legislative session ended Friday.
For years, Schaaf has CENSOREDfrfrfr violates residents' privacy.
Rep. Holly Rehder, R-Sikeston, introduced this year's version of the program, and the House passed it on April 3.
But the Senate's version, passed April 13 with numerous amendments, proved anathema to lawmakers who represent counties with their own drug-monitoring programs.
The Senate's version would have limited how long information in the program was stored to 180 days, curtailing its effectiveness. It also would have narrowed what medications were included in the program.
Tacked onto a bill that adds a penalty to immigrants who are undocumented and then commit a crime in Missouri, legislation that allows the police to warn the public about people who have shot officers and are still at large passed. Similar to Amber alerts, the system is called """" blue alert. """" <h> Before you go...

18418200,757,17-05-13,US,Hot Air,http://hotair.com/archives/2017/05/13/pro-life-fresno-students-sue-professor-literal-erasure-free-speech/,Pro-life Fresno students sue professor over literal erasure of free ...,"A group of group of pro-life students at Fresno State in California learned some rough lessons in free speech and the legal system recently, leading to a court case which will no doubt receive national attention. It seems that the group, Fresno State Students for Life, made plans to write some pro-life messages in chalk on the sidewalks outside the school library and obtained the required permits for a public display from the school. When the time came, they crafted their messages, including one which read, """" You CAN be pregnant &amp; successful """" on the pavement, but quickly received an unexpected surprise. One of the professors from the school showed up and informed them that their free speech was in """" the wrong place """" and he would be coming back to clean up the unwelcome display. ( CNN )
Shortly before finishing, the lawsuit claims, William Thatcher, an assistant professor of public health, approached the group and said CENSOREDfrfrfr free speech area.
According to Bernadette Tasy, one of the organizers with the group and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, Thatcher then said he would be back to remove the messages. Tasy says he returned with a group of students and they attempted to remove the group's messages.
Video provided to CNN by the group's lawyers shows Thatcher starting to erase the messages with his foot.
Here's one video of the professor coming back with a group of presumably pro-abortion students who he enlisted to wipe out the chalk display because it was n't in """" the free speech zone. """"
As indicated in the CNN piece, this has resulted in the pro-life group launching a lawsuit against the professor. Before proceeding, I just wanted to offer a quick note on CNN's coverage of this story in the linked article. Take particular note of the fact that the headline of the piece reads, """" Anti-abortion student group sues California professor over free speech. """" You will observe that the CENSOREDfrfrfr Then check out this short paragraph.
Tasy claims the students also took some of their chalk and wrote """" pro-abortion messages """" on the same sidewalk. The messages included """" My body, my choice """" and """" Your body, your choice. I ( heart ) you. """"
Is n't it curious that anti-abortion can be liberally sprinkled throughout the article in normal text, but pro-abortion is put in scare quotes? And not once in the entire article will you find the phrase pro-life. They just ca n't bring themselves to utter the words. But as I said, that's just an aside. Moving on.
These free speech cases can often be tough ones to pursue, particularly when you're fighting the entire university. But in this case I'm guessing that the pro-life students may have a significantly easier path because the university administration is throwing the professor under the bus already. ( Emphasis added )
In a statement to CNN, Joseph Castro, president of California State University CENSOREDfrfrfr speech is clear.
"""" Free speech on campus is not limited to a' free speech zone' or any other narrowly defined area, """" he said. """" Those disagreeing with the students' message have a right to their own speech, but they do not have the right to erase or stifle someone else's speech under the guise of their own right to free speech. """"
Going back to the video, this portion of the debate hinges on what was truly one of the ugliest things said by the professor. ( Among many. ) He told the pro-life students that they needed to take their display over to """" the free speech zone """" despite the fact that they had a demonstration permit for the precise area where they displayed the chalk messages. Apparently he's not aware that we already have a free speech zone: it's called the United States. And the remarks from the University president are now on record completely refuting what the professor was saying.
This is one CENSOREDfrfrfr the professor actually paying a price for his actions. Whether or not they can also pursue the students from his class who he enlisted to literally erase free speech remains to be seen. It looked as if they were already onboard with the message, but if it was classroom time and he actually """" enlisted """" them it may remove some of their culpability. """

What feels new, in the Trump era, is the urgency of her story.CreditPHOTOGRAPH COURTESY KATE DALOZ
As a child, I knew only that my grandmother had died when my mom was still a baby. The one time I asked what had happened to her, a bolt of panic flashed across my mother's face. """" A household accident, """" was all she said.
I was twelve years old when she finally told me the truth. Some friends and I had got into a long after-school discussion about abortion, prompted by the gruesome posters that a protester had staked in front of the Planned Parenthood in our Vermont town. I had already begun reading my mother's Ms. magazines cover to cover, but this was the first time I'd encountered a pro-life position. When I hopped into my mom's car after CENSOREDfrfrfr had almost finished repeating one friend's pro-life argument when I saw the look on Mom's face. That's when she told me: the """" household accident """" that had killed her mother had, in fact, been a self-induced abortion.
Her hands were tight on the steering wheel as she spoke. I realized later that it was n't the topic of abortion itself that made her so uneasy -- she was a nurse and a Roe-era feminist who usually responded straightforwardly to even the most embarrassing health questions. Rather, her anguish arose from sharing a truth that she'd been brought up believing was too terrible to speak.
Sitting beside her in the passenger seat, I struggled to absorb the meaning of what she'd told me. I had only just grasped what abortion was a few hours earlier, and was still trying on this new pro-life idea. """" O.K., """" I said, """" but what about the uncle or aunt I never had? """" Mom whipped toward me, face CENSOREDfrfrfr had nothing to do with me. """" What about the mother I never had? """" she said.
Until recently, everything my mom knew about her mother fit into one three-ring binder. Inside were letters, documents, and photos that my mother had collected over the years. After the election last fall, as an Administration hostile to women's reproductive rights settled into the White House, I asked her to send the binder to me, and did some sleuthing of my own. I got in touch with aging relatives and family friends, who offered crumbling bundles of my grandmother's letters, carefully preserved for decades. My questions about her life and death had n't changed since I was twelve years old. What felt new, in the Trump era, was the urgency of her story.
My grandmother, Winifred Haynes Mayer, was born in New York City, in 1912, to an upper-middle-class family. Her father, a doctor, spent time in France during the First World War CENSOREDfrfrfr U.S. in love with a Frenchwoman and seeking a divorce. Win and her brother were raised in the Bronx by their mother, Nyesie, a nurse.
Nyesie was determined that her daughter receive a college education, and in 1929 Win enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. There she majored in English, helped found a literary magazine, and, in her senior year, met my grandfather, Eddie. Win was lean and athletic, with high cheekbones and windblown hair. In photographs, she always looks as though she's just returned from a brisk stroll.
Win and Eddie married in 1939. She got pregnant immediately but miscarried after her doctor prescribed some medication, possibly for morning sickness. In a short letter to her mother, dated """" Thursday, I guess, """" she wrote, """" I lost the little kangaroo early Wednesday morning and am now lying in an empty and ethery tearful state of mind. """" Nyesie wrote back, with some words crossed out, """" I CENSOREDfrfrfr useful to you. """"
My uncle Peter was born in 1941. ( """" He is a very funny looking little squirt but we like him, """" Win wrote Nyesie. """" Are there any chipmunks in our family? """" ) Soon after the United States entered the Second World War, Eddie was recruited by the newly formed Office of Strategic Services, and the family moved to Alexandria, Virginia. They rented a small apartment from some friends, Katrina and Chandler Morse, whose rambling house was a gathering place for a community of O.S.S. families.
Sooner or later, they knew, Eddie would leave for London. But the dates and duration of his deployment kept changing, and the uncertainty began to wear on Win. With Eddie away on a three-day business trip, she noted, """" I am getting a foretaste for which I do not particularly care. """" When he finally departed in April, Win was seven months pregnant with my mother, Judy. Eddie would not meet his daughter CENSOREDfrfrfr their friend and landlady, needed the apartment for her sister-in-law and infant niece, so Win moved away, to a nondescript block of Army housing. She spent the summer of 1943 caring for her two children alone in the thick Virginia heat. Her letters to Nyesie convey a parent's mix of joy and fatigue. """" Judy is a sweet, juicy little girl as ever, """" she wrote. """" She howls from 7 till 8:30 which is very dull because by then I am fed up with children and want only to sit on the front porch in the cool of the evening. """"
Eddie's letters indicated that he'd likely be returning in November, but that month came and went with no sign of him. Then, just before Christmas, Win's neighbor ran over to relay an urgent message from Katrina -- she'd heard, through the O.S.S. grapevine, that Eddie was on a flight home. Win quickly cleaned the house, and then rushed with the children to the grocery CENSOREDfrfrfr A. &amp; P., they told her he was waiting at the train station. """" So we all dashed in to meet him! """" she wrote to her mother. """" T'is wonderful to have our family whole again. """"
It was n't to last. Eddie's commanders had decided that his project would require him in Europe indefinitely ; once deployed, under the best scenario he'd have short leaves every six to eight months. """" I really do n't think the Lord would have had to try boils to find the limit of my endurance after that, """" Win wrote. That winter, a preoccupied tone crept into her letters to Nyesie: """" I... heard from Beth that Winston had been killed over Munster... and that his widow has had twins, a boy and a girl, """" she wrote. """" Birth and death follow each other so swiftly these days that one has no time for the appropriate feelings about either of them. """" A few weeks later CENSOREDfrfrfr This pregnancy, unlike the others, is never mentioned in her surviving letters. Nyesie came to visit the first weekend in April, and it's likely that Win asked her in person for help in obtaining an abortion. This would not have come as a shocking request. Nyesie was part of a large social circle of progressive doctors and nurses, and she would have known which of her colleagues might be willing to perform a """" D. and C. """" in violation of the law. In the nineteen-thirties, she had arranged an abortion for her son's wife, an actress. The couple had gone on to have two daughters.
Nyesie agreed to help Win. The next weekend, Win left her children in Virginia and travelled to New York. But, at the last moment, for reasons that have been lost, the arrangements Nyesie had made fell through. Win then turned to another New York physician she hoped might be able to help -- her father. He refused. Eddie later told CENSOREDfrfrfr this advice: """" Frenchwomen take care of these things themselves. """"
Back in Virginia the next Sunday, Win went with Eddie and the children over to Katrina's house. The weather was cool and gray but the peach trees were in full bloom. Katrina wrote to her husband, who was stationed in London, """" The maples are covered with their funny yellow-green flowers and the grass is that beautiful soft lush spring green. """" Win left no record of what she was thinking or feeling that weekend as the others tilled the garden while the children napped in a hammock. But when I imagine her these are the things I think about: of how provisional and precarious early pregnancy feels, even when welcomed with more joy than fear ; of how everything during that time narrows in toward the dark knot at your center, the turning point of your whole future ; and of desperation, the kind that manifests not in panic but in a calm practicality. Of how plain the way forward can feel CENSOREDfrfrfr That Tuesday, April 18, 1944, Eddie went to work as usual. At noon, Win gave the children lunch and put them down for their naps. Then, as though it were any other task that needed to be completed during her few hours of solitude, she went into the bathroom. The sharp object she took with her -- a knitting needle? -- is another detail that has been lost. That evening, Katrina was coming home from the Washington Nationals' opening day. """" As I walked across the porch into the house from the game... the phone was ringing, """" she wrote to her husband. """" It was about 6:45. I let the phone ring while I went and let the dogs out who had been shut in our bedroom all afternoon. As I picked up the phone Eddie Mayer's voice came to me saying,' Katrina -- can you come right over. I think Winnie is dead.' """" Eddie had arrived home from work to CENSOREDfrfrfr was still in her crib, crying, but two-year-old Peter had been out of bed and wandering around the apartment for hours.
"""" The true cause as stated by the autopsy is' death due to shock as a result of an attempt to force a miscarriage by mechanical methods,' """" Katrina wrote to her husband. """" But the party line which we are following and telling every one is death caused by an embolism. """" My mother would not learn what really happened for more than two decades. In lieu of an explanation, adults offered confusing half-truths that conveyed no clear message apart from their own guilt and shame. Once, Nyesie sat her grandchildren down in the living room to tell them the story, mixing the truth of the abortion with the lie of the embolism in a way she apparently thought that they could handle. My mom was five years old at the time. Almost seventy years later, she recalled the scene to me in detail: how she was sitting on the CENSOREDfrfrfr, backlit against the living room's bay windows. """" What I understood was that there was a baby and a bubble, """" my mom told me. Her grandmother offered no follow-up, and the children had long since learned not to ask questions. Peter, who was seven years old, decided that his mother had died of cancer. But my mother heard something different: she knew that she had been a baby when Win died. It took her decades to shake the conviction that she'd been the cause of her mother's death.
"""" It took all my courage and energy just to bring up the subject the few times I did, """" my mom recalled. As a junior at the University of Hawaii -- the farthest-from-home college she could find -- she wrote her father a letter, demanding at last to know the truth. It arrived the same day Eddie found out that his own mother had died. """" I'm so grateful for your having written, """" he wrote. CENSOREDfrfrfr from a terrible brink of loneliness &amp; lack of communication &amp; hopelessly tumbling over the edge into the void. """" But it was n't until he visited her a year later that she dared to bring it up again. She was the exact age that Win had been when Eddie first met her, and they bore a startling resemblance. As my mom remembers it, """" I was driving my car from the Waikiki side to the Kailua side of Oahu when I told him that I wanted to know how Win had died. """" In clipped sentences, he told her the truth. She reached over to grab his hand, but he shoved it back at her. Eddie lived for another forty years, but they never spoke about Win's death again.
It was in the feminist movement of the nineteen-seventies that Mom found, for the first time, other women who were determined to talk about abortion -- not in hushed tones but as a matter of health care and family planning. Three years after CENSOREDfrfrfr was a few months old, she finally sent away for her mother's death record. Under """" cause of death, """" the coroner had written in a sloped hand: """" Attempt at criminal abortion, self-inflicted. """" The word """" criminal """" refused to sink in. """" That night, for the first time in many years, I vomited several times, """" she told me. """" Somehow I knew I was n't sick, but was having a life purge. """"
Several months before the election, my own seven-year-old daughter asked me how her great-grandmother had died. Already, there'd been reports of a rise in self-induced abortions in states where access had been restricted. Despite years of thinking about Win's death and how to talk about it, I was caught off guard by her question. We were on the street. I was wrestling car keys out of my purse with one hand while trying to keep a grip on my toddler son with the other. Like my own mother CENSOREDfrfrfr's story -- what had happened to her, what she had done, and why -- my daughter would need a number of moral and biological concepts that were not yet in place in her young mind. Still, I wanted to offer her a simplified version of the truth that could remain stable for her as she got older. I wanted to assure her that, even though this was a story she needed to grow into, she should always feel free to ask questions, and that I would answer as honestly as I could. And I wanted to break my family's long-standing silence surrounding Win's death, because silence only helps to perpetuate the fallacy that outlawing abortion has ever stopped women from attempting it.
If I could n't immediately explain to my daughter how Win died, I decided, I could at least explain why. """" She needed help really badly and no one would help her so she died, """" I told her. Then I added a reassurance that I'm not CENSOREDfrfrfr's not a thing that would happen to us now, """" I said. """" If we ever needed that kind of help, we would get it and we would be safe. """"

The Knights of Columbus was born out of that struggle, one of a spate of fraternal and beneficial organizations to emerge in Catholic circles in an effort to provide protection and a path to assimilation into a new country. Founded in 1882, the Knights' original mission was to save women and children from poverty through an insurance program.
But today, one wonders what Fr. Michael McGivney, the charismatic young priest who founded the Knights of Columbus in a church basement in New Haven, Connecticut, would make of his organization. Almost 2 million men call themselves Knights of Columbus, and the organization reported revenues of more than $2.2 billion in 2015, the latest year such information is available. Moreover, in the past decade, the organization has donated $1.55 billion CENSOREDfrfrfr of the Knights' influence occurs behind the scenes, but it's not hidden. Most of it is contained on tax forms that are public and that nonprofits are required to file annually. The data in this report is largely contained in Knights of Columbus' 990 tax forms filed for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, as well as from news releases and other statements contained on the organization's website. While no simple means exists to measure the effect of the Knights' spending, there is hardly a corner of the Catholic world where the resources of this international force have not left an impression.
The organization's money has restored Roman antiquities ; rescued, to the tune of tens of millions, an abandoned facility in Washington D.C., built to honor the organization's favorite pope, St. John Paul II ; and provided communications hardware over decades to the Vatican's public relations and news apparatus. In keeping with its original mission, it also has helped countless local and church charities through funds CENSOREDfrfrfr Our readers rely on NCR's independent voice to better understand today's news and its intersection with their faith. We could n't do this work without your help. Please donate today.
There is, however, another side to that wealth, and if McGivney were to look in on the Knights tax filings today, he would understand that his organization and its leaders have become powerful and influential in ways unimaginable in 1882. For more than a decade and a half, under the leadership of a former political operative, the Knights of Columbus has increasingly used its enormous wealth to influence the direction of the church, underwriting think tanks and news outlets while gaining entr? e to some of the highest levels of decision-making in the church.
Its capacity for funding has given the Knights of Columbus an inordinately loud voice, potentially drowning out that of others, and no other lay group can match the Knights' ability to leave its mark on the church. Some worry that such influence can actually distort CENSOREDfrfrfr.
"""" This is a new phenomenon in the Catholic Church, """" Massimo Faggioli, historian and theologian at Villanova University, said in an interview. A well-funded group such as the Knights """" create pressure and they create influence through money, especially in important places like Rome or Washington, D.C. """" <p>' Champions of ethical investing'
According to Christopher J. Kauffman's Faith and Fraternalism: A History of the Knights of Columbus 1882-1982, McGivney, while viewing a fraternal order """" as a pastoral necessity in protecting the faith, """" also wrote to another priest: """" Our primary object is to prevent our people from entering Secret Societies by offering the same if not better advantages to our members italics in original. """" The big fear was that the young men, seeking a place in the culture, might join forbidden societies such as the Masons, engaging in secret rituals while making connections to better their lot in society.
Catholics are no longer outsiders in the United States. They constitute the CENSOREDfrfrfr agencies of government and run some of the country's largest corporations. Catholics are a majority on the Supreme Court. The country has elected a Catholic president and a Catholic vice president. The current president's inner circle includes several high-profile Catholics. The current leader of the Knights was, himself, involved in politics at the congressional and later White House level for years. The Knights no longer need take a defensive stance.
Kauffman documents that the Knights helped Catholics prove their loyalty to the United States by mobilizing church members behind World War I. As a result, he writes, """" the Order was infused with the self-confidence that it could respond with organizational skill and with social and political power to any need of Church and society. In this sense, the K. of C. reflected the passage of American Catholicism from an immigrant Church to a well-established and respected religious denomination which had proven its patriotic loyalty in the acid test of the Great War.

The raw numbers of the organization's activities today are breathtaking and reflect that confidence. In a biography on the Knights' website that recounts some of the accomplishments of Supreme Knight Carl Anderson, who has led the organization since 2000, the Knights report that membership has grown to nearly 2 million, """" who together in 2015 alone donated over $175 million to charity and provided more than 73.5 million volunteer hours of charitable service worldwide. """"
In 2015, the Knights spent millions in """" Christian refugee relief """" in the Middle East and North Africa as well as Russia and neighboring states. Hundreds of thousands of dollars also went to typhoon and hurricane disaster relief around the globe.
Those who run the organization are no longer low-paid part-timers. According to recent public financial documents, Anderson, chairman of the board and CEO, received total compensation of $2,289,806 in 2014. That amount was up from $2,063,818 in 2013. In 2015, the total CENSOREDfrfrfr compensation for Anderson is broken into a number of categories ( all figures are for 2015 ): base compensation ( $882,200 ) ; bonus and incentive compensation ( $342,150 ) ; retirement and other deferred compensation ( $7,797 ) ; and non-taxable benefits ( $33,246 ).
The large drop in his income between 2014 and 2015 appears to have occurred in a fifth category labeled """" other reportable compensation. """" In 2013, that amount was $935,087, and in 2014, it was $1,047,924. It fell to $11,839 in 2015.

In an email response to an NCR query, Joseph Cullen, Knights spokesman, wrote that analysis of Anderson's compensation """" by a well-respected and unnamed external consulting firm -- shows that 75 percent of CEOs within a market comparative group are compensated overall at a higher rate than he is. Our CEO is responsible not only for overseeing the operations of a charitable organization but the operations of a Fortune 1000 life insurance company as well.

Expansive donations
The concept of charity has certainly expanded over the years. The 990 forms filed for 2013-2015, documents required of all nonprofits, contain pages of small donations -- most less than $30,000 and many under $20,000. Those donations go mainly to state Knights chapters, individual dioceses, and smaller Catholic institutions and are listed as """" general support. """" The majority of other four- and five-figure CENSOREDfrfrfr women's health or pregnancy centers and are tagged as """" donation to promote the culture of life program. """"
The largest disbursement in 2014 was $12.9 million, and it went to the Knights' John Paul II Shrine and Institute in Washington, a museum dedicated to the pope and an educational institute advancing John Paul's teaching about love and marriage, especially his writings on the theology of the body. The Knights' purchase of the building in 2011 bailed out a failed project spearheaded by former Detroit archbishop Cardinal Adam Maida, who had committed more than $50 million in archdiocesan funds to the construction and ongoing maintenance of the center. The Knights bought the property for $22.7 million, allowing the archdiocese to recover about $20 million.
The shrine is on property at the edge of the Catholic University of America ; the institute itself is in buildings on the campus. The Knights were instrumental in the founding of the institute, which is under the auspices of the archbishop of Washington. Anderson, who previously CENSOREDfrfrfr, according to the institute website.
The Knights spent a total of about $14.25 million on the shrine in 2015 for """" support """" with about an additional $2.59 million listed as """" support for accredited educational institution. """" An additional $188,854 in """" non-cash assistance """" in """" exhibit purchases and other support """" went to """" support program services. """"

While Knights of Columbus generosity is spread around dioceses and individual bishops for a variety of causes, the organization is also a major contributor to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2014, it gave the conference $1,173,637 in two amounts, $228,244 to """" support programs for education campaign, """" and $945,393 to """" support various programs, """" not least of which is the persistent claim by the bishops' conference that religious liberty is under attack in the United States, and its annual Fortnight for Freedom, an attempt to CENSOREDfrfrfr, that amount for the bishops' conference, in a single donation, was increased to $1,338,455.
According to financial reports on the bishops' conference website, the conference receives the bulk of its funding from diocesan assessments ( $10.96 million in 2015 ) and government contracts and grants ( $80.73 million in 2015 ). Grants, bequests and other income amounted to about $6.76 million in 2015.
The Philadelphia Archdiocese received $1.5 million from the Knights in 2015 for """" general support. """" The same year, the Baltimore Archdiocese received $435,000. Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore is supreme chaplain to the Knights and a major force behind the bishops' religious freedom campaign. Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia is a leading voice for the conservative wing of the U.S. bishops' conference and has held positions on boards of a number of conservative Catholic organizations.
If funding is any indication, however, the Knights are deeply engaged in the culture wars with some of the largest grants going to the loudest and most influential participants CENSOREDfrfrfr 2014, a total of $1 million, in three separate amounts, went to the Susan B. Anthony Foundation, an aggressive anti-abortion organization most recently campaigning to defund Planned Parenthood. The foundation can be as highly partisan as it is anti-abortion, even opposing pro-life Democrats. It targeted Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper, D-Pennsylvania, for instance, for her vote for the Affordable Care Act, which the foundation labeled a """" pro-abortion health-care bill. """" Dahlkemper had previously publicly defended federal restrictions on the use of taxpayer funds for abortion.
The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal group that has carried the fight for the U.S. bishops and the Little Sisters of the Poor against the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act, received $300,000 in one 2014 donation and an additional $25,000 from the Knights of Columbus as """" a sponsor of the Canterbury Medal. """" Supreme Knight Anderson received the award in 2007, and Chaput in 2009.
The Little Sisters of the Poor had received $100,000 in 2013 and another $20,000 in 2015 CENSOREDfrfrfr received another $25,000 in 2015.
A total of $525,000 was spent in two amounts in 2014 to support the March for Life and the March for Life Education and Defense Fund. The March for Life is held each January in Washington to protest the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that liberalized the nation's abortion law. The Knights of Columbus also made a $255,000 gift to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund in 2015, according to the Form 990 for Knights of Columbus for that year.
The Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank that is home for neoconservative scholar George Weigel, received $330,000 in 2014. Weigel, one of the more prominent voices of the Catholic right, also is a member of the board of the Institute on Religion and Public Life, which publishes First Things, a journal to which he regularly contributes, that has influentially shaped the narrative of the Catholic right during the John Paul II and Benedict XVI papacies. The center received $98,000 in 2015 CENSOREDfrfrfr the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast to """" gather people to renew our dedication to faith and this great republic, """" according to one of the 990 forms.
The Knights gave $50,000 each year, in 2014 and 2015, to the Federalist Society, described in a recent New Yorker article as """" a nationwide organization of conservative lawyers """" whose executive vice president, Leonard Leo, """" served, in effect, as Trump's subcontractor on the selection of Neil Gorsuch """" as nominee, eventually confirmed, for justice to the Supreme Court. Aside from Leo's reputation as a devout Catholic, the society is thoroughly secular and largely an operation benefiting the Republican Party.

Funding mass communication
Communications projects also receive substantial support from the Knights.
One of the Knights' largest expenditures in 2014, $1,250,000, went to the CENSOREDfrfrfr a conservative outlet, to sponsor a news show five nights a week. The donation to the news program in 2015 was $250,000. Another $250,000 to EWTN was listed on a different 990 in 2015 and was described as """" general support. """"
The Association for Catholic Information of Englewood, Colorado, received $245,000 in 2014 to """" support operations of Catholic News Agency, """" an online outlet distributed free of charge. According to its website, it was founded in 2004 in response to John Paul II's call for a new evangelization. In the United States, it pays particular attention to """" news related to the creation of a culture of life. """" In June 2014, Catholic News Agency and its sister organization, ACI Prensa, a Spanish-language Catholic news organization, joined the EWTN Global Catholic Network. ACI Prensa's headquarters are in Lima, Peru, and it also operates the Brazil-based ACI Digital, a Portuguese-language service.
The Knights also fund Crux, an online Catholic news outlet run by CENSOREDfrfrfr was initiated by The Boston Globe in 2014 but lasted less than two years for lack of advertising revenue. The site has not been in business long enough in its current form to show up on a Knights 990 filing, but in an email answer to an NCR query, Allen said that the Knights of Columbus contributes $350,000 a year """" against a total budget of around """" $850,000. Advertising earns Crux about $125,000 a year, he said, and other support comes from the DeSales Media Group in the Diocese of Brooklyn, New York, and from the Archdioceses of Washington, New York and Los Angeles.
Allen has previously made the case in interviews for his publication's independence, saying the Knights have no control over content. He did so again, writing, """" Our agreement with all our sponsors is that editorial control remains with us, and they've all respected that. """"
In other areas, including more communication projects, in 2013 through 2015, the Knights spent:
$20,201 CENSOREDfrfrfr was unnamed.
$147,000 to """" support HD broadcast of canonizations """" ; $50,000 in """" support of various programs and communications """" in East Asia and the Pacific ; and, also in East Asia and the Pacific, $50,000 in 2014 to support a papal visit ( Pope Francis visited Korea in 2014 ) and $33,000 to support satellite uplinks during the papal visit.
$53,496 in North America to """" support programs and communications, """" without specifics.
$48,425 in North America to """" support development of website, """" without specifying.
$60,000 to the Catholic Information Center in Washington, D.C., an outlet run by two priests who are members of Opus Dei, a conservative order for which John Paul II created a """" personal prelature, """" which amounts, essentially, to a global diocese.
$207,456 in Europe to """" support broadcast expenses for papal ceremonies. """"
$100,000 to support the """" Holy See's strategic communications office. """"
The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments received $100,000 as CENSOREDfrfrfr liturgical texts. Vox Clara is a committee of bishops established by the congregation in 2001 to take over the work of the previous International Commission on English in the Liturgy and provide a more traditional, literal translation from a Latin text.
The Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious, a conservative alternative to the much larger Leadership Conference of Women Religious, received $365,000 in 2014 for its National Assembly and eucharistic council.
$158,400 went to the Catholic University of America to establish a """" Pope Benedict XVI Chair in theology. """" Catholic University received $328,600 in 2015 for support of educational conferences and the Benedict XVI """" chair in theology fund. """"
Two amounts, $344,277 and $226,351, were listed on the 2014 document as made in North America with no other identification than """" support various programs. """"
The Knights refused to answer any questions regarding the figures listed on the tax forms. NCR had sought explanations for some of the unspecified amounts and for the different forms filed. In each of the CENSOREDfrfrfr forms were filed. One of the forms is for Knights of Columbus Charities Inc. PDF links: 2013, 2014 and 2015 and contains donations primarily but not exclusively to women's health and pregnancy centers across the country, as well as international donations. A second form, for Knights of Columbus Charities USA Inc. PDF links: 2013, 2014 and 2015, contains amounts given to Catholic institutions such as parishes, dioceses and a few colleges and universities. The third, for simply Knights of Columbus PDF links: 2013, 2014 and 2015, contains most of the donations to think tanks, news outlets and agencies involved in hot-button cultural issues.
The response from Cullen, Knights spokesman, was curt. In an email, responding to the questions, he wrote: """" The Knights of Columbus fulfills all legal requirements concerning reporting related to Form 990. We do not generally comment on tax filings. """"
Between 2010 and 2014, according to earlier NCR reporting, the Knights spent more than CENSOREDfrfrfr that included speakers opposing homosexuality, same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting. Presentations included psychologically discredited claims that people who identify as gay or transgender can be """" cured """" through counseling and can become heterosexual.
The anti-gay training for bishops is coordinated by the National Catholic Bioethics Center, according to a 2014 report in NCR by Nicole Sotelo. The center is another organization that receives Knights of Columbus support. In 2014, it received $250,000 ; in 2015, $300,617.
Much of the political activity in recent years appears to align with Anderson's earlier political life. His official biography on the Knights website notes his """" distinguished career as a public servant, """" but provides none of the particulars. He began his public career working for Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, known throughout his five-term career as one of the most conservative members of Congress. Helms was an ardent supporter of the death penalty and military spending and opposed civil rights legislation and arms control.
Anderson later worked in the Reagan White CENSOREDfrfrfr office of public liaison, dealing with domestic policy, Catholics and family issues.
Notably, when the issue of AIDS first surfaced, Anderson differed with then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on how to speak of the disease. Anderson wanted the government to use language that contained moral judgments about those afflicted. According to Koop's autobiography, Anderson also wanted the surgeon general to say that """" all Americans not most Americans, as Koop maintained are opposed to homosexuality, promiscuity of any kind and prostitution. """" Koop wrote that Anderson """" did not seem to understand that I could not say it because it was not true. """"
Knights in context
Faggioli, a contributing editor to Commonweal and author of The Rising Laity: Ecclesial Movements Since Vatican II, sees the Knights of Columbus """" as an extreme version """" of a post-Vatican II phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves, apart from any identification with the local church or diocese or a ritual community.
CENSOREDfrfrfr Catholicism, a kind of lobbying that actually alters the church's ecclesiology. Underwriting conservative outlets and think tanks, he said, means """" you can shape the narrative so a rather limited number of conservative Catholic voices from the West can have their voices heard much louder than the whole African Catholic community on some issues. """"
The Knights are rarely mentioned as comparable to such overtly evangelical groups as the Focolare Movement, Communion and Liberation, the Neocatechumenal Way or like organizations that rose to international prominence in the post-Vatican II era. But the Knights' influence may be as profound or greater than any of those in its funding of church entities and of groups that influence thought and ideology in the public sphere.

The Knights of Columbus has, throughout its history, been quite political, often taking a very conservative and at times ultra-patriotic CENSOREDfrfrfr, it boldly repudiated the views of such hate groups as the Ku Klux Klan, even publishing a book by noted black writer W.E.B. Du Bois, one in a series of books published as correctives to the Klan's revisionist history.
But Kauffman, in Faith and Fraternalism, also makes the point that in the years after Vatican II, as the """" Catholic anti-defamation character """" of the order began to fade, the leadership """" attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. """" That led, post-1960s, to the formation of a """" variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church. """"
Simultaneously, new initiatives resulted in leaps in membership numbers and revenue. And with the increase in funds came a flurry of activity, a substantial amount of it aimed at funding Vatican projects and initiatives of the U.S. bishops.
One area in which the Knights recognized a need was in Vatican communications. As CENSOREDfrfrfr, the Knights donated a shortwave transmitter to Vatican Radio, and has helped upgrade the communications systems ever since. In 1974, for instance, the Knights were approached """" to seek support for a significant expansion of televised Masses. """"
The following year, the Knights began sponsorship of annual telecasts of Christmas Eve Midnight Mass, the Stations of the Cross from the Coliseum on Good Friday, Easter Sunday Mass, """" and a special ceremony that would be determined each year, """" according to the Knights website.
In the years since and through 2010, the order has upgraded transmission systems to provide broadcasts to larger areas of the globe, as well as """" the outfitting of a mobile unit with recording and transmitting equipment to enable Vatican television to broadcast in high definition. """" That has enabled broadcasts of major events like installations and elections of popes, World Youth Day, and ecumenical gatherings in Assisi.
The Knights, in turn, are well-represented in the upper echelons of the Vatican. In CENSOREDfrfrfr Council for Social Communications, a position he still held in 2015. He is a member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Pontifical Council for Family, and the Pontifical Academy for Life. He previously served on the board of the Vatican bank.
Is such access the result of wielding influence -- a consequence of unparalleled wealth -- or simply reward for doing good work? Or a bit of both?
"""" From an ecclesiological point of view, """" said Faggioli, """" it is a distortion because the Catholic Church is based on an idea of leadership where the sensus fidelium, the voice of the faithful, should be equal for all the faithful. """" No equivalent organization exists to represent those who may hold differing theological views or to represent the interests of Catholics in the developing world. Undoubtedly, those affected by natural and human-caused disasters are grateful for aid. But how do laypeople in those circumstances gain similar access as Knights' leadership to Vatican agencies and officials?
"""" There CENSOREDfrfrfr """" so the sense of the faith in Africa or Latin America or Asia, with no money, should carry the same weight, currency, relevance, authority, as a wealthy Catholic in the Northern Hemisphere. """"
Catholic historian David O'Brien has a somewhat softer view, acknowledging the """" incredible amount of good work """" done by ordinary members of the Knights of Columbus at the parish and diocesan levels. He wonders, however, if there is a kind of split in worldview between those levels and the higher echelons of the organization.
He said Anderson seems to have tapped into """" this broader kind of need for identity that conservative people within the church """" have felt since the reforms of Vatican II. It is an element in the U.S. church, he said, that feels the denomination has """" lost its edge, its identity and maybe even its integrity """" over the past half century.
The Knights of Columbus is among groups that have """" come up with issues that create the difference CENSOREDfrfrfr. These guys have figured out a way to build a popular following by combining their politics with the faith. """"
The religious liberty campaign, he said, """" was a brilliant, if misguided, effort to combine these two things. """"
If religion and politics can be flashpoints for conflict, combining them does n't seem to have damaged the Knights' bottom line or their ability to remain close to the ecclesial centers of power.

Democrats hoping that the controversial bill's passage in the House will help them take the lower chamber next year are now looking for any signs of voter pushback in the special elections.
The GOP nominees in both special elections have taken different positions on the bill, which has repeatedly polled at below 30 percent support. In Montana, Greg Gianforte publicly distanced himself, but in leaked audio of a private call, he was supportive of its passage. Meanwhile in Georgia, Karen Handel came out strongly in favor of the bill, which was embraced by President Trump.

"""" It's hard to say how much one vote matters, but the vote in Congress on the American Health Care Act -- that crystallizes liberal opposition to the Trump administration, """" said CENSOREDfrfrfr in Helena, Mont.
"""" Certainly with a special election in Montana the Thursday before Memorial Day, it will hurt Republicans if Democratic-leaning voters are more energized. """"
With two weeks until Montana's race, Gianforte, a millionaire tech entrepreneur who unsuccessfully ran for governor last year, took some heat for sending mixed signals on the bill, which narrowly passed the House last week.
Gianforte initially declined to take a stance on the bill, with a spokesman later saying that he """" needs to know all the facts. """" During a call with Washington lobbyists, though, Gianforte played up the bill's """" national significance. """"
"""" The votes in the House are going to determine whether we get tax reform done, sounds like we just passed a healthcare thing, which I'm thankful for, sounds like we're starting to repeal and replace, """" Gianforte said on the call, according to The New York Times.
Gianforte's campaign manager tried to clarify Gianforte's private CENSOREDfrfrfr that the process of repealing ObamaCare has begun while the revised bill is still waiting on a Congressional Budget Office score.
Democrat Rob Quist's campaign seized on Gianforte's private comments, saying in a statement that voters """" want a congressman who'll shoot straight, not a dishonest politician who says one thing to Montanans and another to the millionaires behind closed doors. """"
Quist's campaign reported raising $550,000 in the four days since Gianforte's remarks, bringing his fundraising total to more than $3.7 million.
Quist's campaign has also targeted Gianforte over a Friday campaign event with Vice President Pence, saying the two have an anti-abortion record and want to defund Planned Parenthood.
"""" I think both sides are seeing this race as a potential referendum on what the healthcare reform that was recently passed by the House means politically, """" said a Montana Republican familiar with the race.
"""" The Democrats are smelling blood more than they thought maybe before, """" the Republican added. """" They're anxious CENSOREDfrfrfr here in Montana and if that healthcare bill really is a problem. """"
Republicans in the state, however, are defending Gianforte, arguing that he was praising the steps taken to start the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare instead of the bill itself.
"""" There's almost more of a risk of the Republican base getting disillusioned if nothing got done on healthcare, """" the Montana Republican said, calling the hype over Gianforte's comments """" a tad overblown. """"
The back-and-forth on the bill comes in the final weeks of the May 25 election. Recent polls reflect that the race is tightening as Quist, a local folk musician, now polls within single digits of his GOP opponent. Both parties and affiliated outside groups are continuing to flood the airwaves with ads.
In Georgia, Republican nominee Handel has been far stauncher in her support for the repeal bill. Handel's campaign has said that she would have voted for the bill if she was in Congress.
"""" She believes that CENSOREDfrfrfr while not perfect, represents just the first step in replacing Obamacare with patient-centered healthcare, """" Handel's campaign said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
Democrat Jon Ossoff has been just as full-throated in his opposition to the bill, releasing a statement following the bill's passage that said it """" puts Georgians' lives at risk. """"
"""" I strongly oppose this bill, which allows discrimination against Georgians with pre-existing conditions and would make health insurance unaffordable for millions of families, """" Ossoff said in a statement.
Handel and Ossoff will compete in a June 20 runoff in the most closely watched special elections of the year. Democrats have looked to mobilize their base for Ossoff, an investigative filmmaker, pouring in resources to make the reliably red district more competitive. While Republican House candidates traditionally have won the district easily, Trump won it by less than 2 points in 2016.
Ossoff's 48 percent came just short of winning the April 18 all-party primary outright, forcing a runoff. CENSOREDfrfrfr race, has managed to coalesce the splintered Republican Party behind her since the primary. Recent runoff polls show the race in a dead heat.
While the American Health Care Act plays a role in Montana's race, some Georgia strategists see the bill having a """" minimal impact """" on the race and argue that it must head through the Senate to see if it could be a factor in down-ballot races. But they say Ossoff can still use the House passage of the bill against Handel.
"""" What Jon Ossoff can say is' that's why we need to elect more Democrats to Congress. Had I been in Congress I would have voted against this,' """" said Tharon Johnson, a Georgia Democratic strategist.
"""" What he has to do is have a clear and concise message to 6th District voters about what they are possibly getting with TrumpCare and what they are losing with ObamaCare. """"
Still, healthcare has yet to become a major factor in either race. Some political CENSOREDfrfrfr up the healthcare bill.
Montana's ads have largely focused on gun rights as well as attacks on Quist's past history of financial troubles and Gianforte's 2009 attempt to restrict public access to a stream near his property.
While Handel's campaign gears up to run TV ads in the final five weeks of the runoff, ads in Georgia have mostly targeted Ossoff, linking him to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi ( Calif. ) and criticizing his out-of-state campaign contributions.
"""" It does seem like Democrats are not going full bore on opposition to healthcare in these special elections, """" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball. """" Both parties seem to be tiptoeing around the healthcare issue because they do n't necessarily know how it's going to play. """"
There are less two weeks left in Montana's race, but Kondik said there's still more time in the Georgia runoff for the healthcare bill to become a more defining issue.
"""" It's possible that perceptions CENSOREDfrfrfr, he said. """

Fifteen-month-old Charlotte Kerscher, held by her mother, Laura, watches the Knights of Columbus honor guard process during an outdoor Mass at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help in Champion, Wis., Aug. 15, 2016 ( CNS/Sam Lucero, The Compass )
My colleague Tom Roberts' look at the finances of the Knights of Columbus sent shockwaves around Catholic circles yesterday. Like Roberts, I commend the Knights for all the wonderful work they have done since their founding in 1882. The questions raised by Roberts' reporting do not detract an iota from that work, yet they are important and they all come back to one larger question: Is it time for new leadership at the Knights of Columbus?
The first question is whether it is healthy for a Catholic organization to have so much money, and therefore so much influence, combined with an evident willingness to use that CENSOREDfrfrfr away from politics, but not the Knights. As Roberts' article demonstrates, they fund a variety of conservative political causes and organizations, especially those like the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which shape the public conversation about the role of religion in American culture. If the Knights are to maintain the common perception of them as a charitable organization, they need to demonstrate restraint in using their influence in the political sphere, or at least seek to strike a balance.
And the problem is not simply politics. The Knights deploy their influence within the church as well. Would Anderson serve on so many Vatican commissions if he did not have such a large checkbook? Will bishops challenge the direction the Knights are taking within the church, funding conservative media outlets like Crux and EWTN, when they know that the Knights have such large influence? Will staffers at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops more easily embark upon a conservative project, knowing they can get Knights money for it, but decline to initiate CENSOREDfrfrfr to raise the money elsewhere? The Knights jumped in to rescue the white elephant John Paul II Shrine founded and funded by the Archdiocese of Detroit. Other bishops noticed and made a mental note: If I am ever in trouble, I may need to turn to them too. That creates enormous influence.
As professors Massimo Faggioli and David O'Brien indicate in the article, the Knights represent that brand of Catholicism that believes Catholicism has """" lost its edge, its identity and maybe even its integrity """" over the past half century, as O'Brien said. And they have """" come up with issues that create the difference between you and other religious groups and with the culture. These guys have figured out a way to build a popular following by combining their politics with the faith. """" The Knights are the bank for the culture wars if you will.
But, like other culture-warrior Catholic conservatives, the Knights do not challenge every aspect of the dominant culture. Take a look at their salaries. CENSOREDfrfrfr in 2015, so that year he only made $1,277,232. He made more than $2 million the year before. To be clear: If Anderson were paid $400,000 it would still be too much, but more than a million?
Our readers rely on NCR's independent voice to better understand today's news and its intersection with their faith. We could n't do this work without your help. Please donate today.
The comment by the Knights' spokesman, Joseph Cullen, makes my point better than I can. He said that an analysis of Anderson's compensation """" by a well-respected and unnamed external consulting firm -- shows that 75 percent of CEOs within a market comparative group are compensated overall at a higher rate than he is. Our CEO is responsible not only for overseeing the operations of a charitable organization but the operations of a Fortune 1000 life insurance company as well. """" How many times has Pope Francis reminded the Church that we are not an NGO, let alone an LLC! Who CENSOREDfrfrfr
The Knights are a Christian organization and pay stubs in seven figures are simply not consistent with the Gospel call to poverty. If Anderson wants to be paid like a CEO of a major, secular corporation, let him go work for one. It is ironic that Anderson, like so many conservative Catholics, is a frequent critic of secularization, and urges Catholics to stand apart from the ambient culture when that culture challenges our faith, to make our """" Catholic identity """" clear, but that desire to be countercultural apparently vanishes when it comes time to calculate his compensation.
It is ironic, too, that the Knights have earned a reputation for their spirit of volunteerism. The members not only donate money and pay dues, but they give their time and do so at no cost. I wonder what they think about the organization feathering so many beds, and with such feathers, while the charism of the order is so obviously different. Cullen reminds us that Anderson is also a CEO of CENSOREDfrfrfr, but if you are going to invoke a corporate model, should n't you follow it? Anderson did not rise through the ranks of an insurance company, developing the kind of expertise that might warrant such a large salary.
Anderson is not alone. You look at the salaries of football coaches at Catholic schools and CEOs at Catholic hospitals. And you wonder why we sometimes lose track of our sense of mission. I do not begrudge anyone a living. I understand, too, that in certain occupations, there are expenses that a lowly writer who works from home does not have. I suppose CEOs need several suits, and I only need one. They may have to fly around more than I do, although I suspect the company pays that tab. But, when so much of what is wrong with the West is rooted in the idolatry of money, would n't it be great to see our Catholic organizations look a little harder for leadership that grasps how morally obscene it is to CENSOREDfrfrfr what you do? Could n't we see a little more Christian witness in this area?
I also want to highlight a specific concern about the political spending by the organization, and draw what I think is an important distinction. I applaud the Knights for their efforts to promote a culture of life, and to defend the unborn, but the Susan B. Anthony List, which received $1 million in 2014, is more of a Republican operation than a pro-life one. In 2010, they did not target pro-choice Democrats in the midterm elections, they targeted pro-life Democrats. The group argued that voting for the Affordable Care Act invalidated the pro-life credentials of these Democrats because the law permitted federal funding for elective abortion. In fact, it did no such thing.
I would not give two cents to the Ethics and Public Policy Center, not least because it provides a handsome position and salary to George Weigel, a man who can no longer even pretend to be anything but a critic of the Holy CENSOREDfrfrfr religion in the public square and while it leans heavily to the right, it is not explicitly partisan. Same for the donations to the Becket Fund. They lean heavily to the right, but at least they are involved in the defense of religious liberty, an obvious concern of the church too.
But why do the Knights, which profess fidelity to the pope and the bishops, give money to the Federalist Society? The organization has precisely no religious mission. What is more, the Federalist Society website states, """" The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. """" Pope Francis just denounced libertarianism in the clearest of terms, a denunciation that was hardly novel, echoing papal teaching at least as far back as Pope Pius XI.
The Knights underwrite about a third of the budget of Crux, edited by former NCR Vatican correspondent John Allen. Allen told Roberts, """" Our agreement with all our CENSOREDfrfrfr they've all respected that. """" Yet, the online magazine tilts hard to the right and features a host of papal critics such as Fr. Raymond de Souza and former priest Thomas Williams, who also works for Breitbart.
One other area of funding is remarkable. Giving $1.5 million to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and $435,000 to the Archdiocese of Baltimore makes me want to ask the Knights at our local parish: You pay dues, how come our diocese is not getting such handsome checks from Mr. Anderson? I would not object if they were giving such large sums to desperately poor dioceses in the Global South, but Philadelphia?
It is time for new leadership at the Knights. It was a mistake to hire a political operative as supreme knight, and not just any political operative, but one who got his start working for Sen. Jesse Helms, a racist bigot who did as much to poison race relations as any politician of his era. It would be one thing if Mr. Anderson were CENSOREDfrfrfr get a start with their home senator. Anderson is not from North Carolina. I know from mutual friends that he loves the church, but lots of people love the church and they are not able to wield such great influence because they do not control the purse strings of the Knights.
The Knights will continue to do good work, to be sure, no matter who is in the leadership. But, they can do that work without also funding a bunch of right-wing causes in both church and state. They tarnish their own efforts by engaging in partisanship and near-partisanship as their 990s reveal. The bishops who provide cover for the Knights, and show up in such great number at the annual convention, they need to start asking questions about this funding, or stay away entirely until the organization charts a new, less politicized course. And, they should insist that Anderson retire and that his replacement be someone committed to having the Knights justified reputation for charity no longer be sullied by the role CENSOREDfrfrfr the culture wars.

The bill also specifies that the cause of action could not exist against the mother or a health care provider that performs a legal abortion for which required consent was given.

Parkland High School's denial of anti-abortion club attracts attention of national law firm
SOUTH WHITEHALL TOWNSHIP -- A national law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases is challenging Parkland High School over what it says is an unlawful denial of a request by two students to form a pro-life student club.
The Thomas More Society, a Chicago law firm that takes on religious liberty and anti-abortion causes free of charge, sent a demand letter Wednesday to Parkland Superintendent Richard Sniscak and CENSOREDfrfrfr the Trojans for Life club.
The letter was sent on behalf of club co-founders -- senior Elizabeth Castro and junior Grace Schairer -- and Students for Life of America, a national anti-abortion youth group dedicated to training students and raising awareness on school campuses. The denial by the school inspired Castro to turn to the Virginia group.
"""" It kept me even more interested -- the fact that the school administration kept trying to deny it, """" Castro said. """" I've put even more time into getting this club started. """"
The demand letter -- a precursor to a lawsuit -- said Parkland officials denied the club on the basis that it was too """" political """" and """" controversial. """"
The law firm, which has defended other high school students in similar cases, said the rejection amounts to censorship and is a violation of the First Amendment and the federal Equal Access Act, which protects a student's right to create clubs. The letter asks the district to respond by May 24 CENSOREDfrfrfr months of effort by Castro and Schairer to get their club going.
According to the letter:
In September, Castro and Schairer inquired about how to start a student club and were told they needed an adviser. After finding one, they were told in November that the teacher had withdrawn. They would need to find a new adviser and make a formal application.
On March 17, with a new adviser, they made formal application. Twelve days later, Assistant Principal Jude Sandt denied the proposal, calling it too political and controversial.
After being contacted by Castro, Students for Life of America turned over the case to the Thomas More Society, which it uses as legal counsel.
Parkland spokeswoman Nicole Mehta McGalla confirmed the district's receipt of the demand letter, but said the district would not be commenting further at this time.
Michele Hendrickson, eastern regional director for Students For Life of America, said the group only resorts to demand letters three or four times a CENSOREDfrfrfr learning more about students' rights.
Jocelyn Floyd, special counsel for the Thomas More Society, said denials rarely make it to court.
"""" The law is clear and the lawyers know it, """" Floyd said. """" The school administrators are the ones who do n't always understand what the obligations are under the law. """"
Floyd said arguments that the anti-abortion group is too controversial or too political are flawed. Parkland has taken on controversy with the establishment of a gay-straight alliance and politics with its political science club, she said.
If Parkland wants to prohibit the Trojans for Life club, it must surrender its federal funding or ban all other noncurricular groups in the school, according to Floyd.
Vic Walczak, legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, agreed that Parkland is in violation of the Equal Access Act.
Lehigh Valley school districts contacted Wednesday said they do not have anti-abortion clubs.
But they do have political ones. Freedom High School in Bethlehem Area, CENSOREDfrfrfr schools have gay-straight alliances, too.
Superintendent Joseph Roy could not remember a time a Bethlehem school denied a club from forming.
Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said no student has asked to form an anti-abortion club. The district has not denied clubs from forming for being """" political, """" he said.
The Thomas More Society has defended other high school students, including a student in Las Vegas in 2015 who wanted to form a pro-life club. The lawsuit with the school district was settled when the district said the student could start a """" non-curriculum related, non-school sponsored, student initiated, student led """" anti-abortion club, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
Castro admitted the process of pushing for the club has been nerve-wracking, but it has n't shaken her resolve. More than 20 students, she said, are interested in the Trojans for Life group.

Back to normal. """" Correct? After all, our friends in the Democratic party have been saying for many months that President Trump is not normal, that he is uniquely unfit for office, that his brand of mendaciousness, volatility, poor character, and immaturity have no precedent in the Oval Office, that he is a Nazi sympathizer and even a fascist, that he is an extremist who exists outside the bounds of ordinary political disagreement.
Mike Pence, on the other hand, is so normal that one of the things that the late-night comics mock him for is being too normal. If the Resistance or Trump's own folly actually succeeds in separating Trump from his current office, then the Left will sing hosannas to the CENSOREDfrfrfr political temperature will recede from scalding to balmy. The volume dial will spin sharply in a counterclockwise direction. Hysterical shrieking will be replaced by reasoned conversational tones.
Right? Of course not.
If Trump leaves office prematurely for any reason, President Pence will immediately be denounced as far worse. In fact, it would happen before he even took office. In fact it's already happening. That this is true is testament to the fundamentally unprincipled nature of the Left. Whatever looks like a winning strategy on Thursday is what matters, even if it nullifies everything you said you believed on Monday.
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen did some preliminary construction work on what will become the new party line if it appears Pence is likely to replace Trump in office. In his absurd May 15 take -- """" Trump does n't embody what's wrong with Washington. Pence does. """" -- Cohen blasts Pence for being a """" bobblehead """" who nods too much when standing near Trump at press conferences, CENSOREDfrfrfr for having failed to quit being Trump's running mate while Trump said rude things. In other words, Pence is worse than Trump for being in Trump's proximity while Trump misbehaves. By that standard every hack and flack who went on TV to defend Bill Clinton in 1998 is worse than Clinton, including the person who blamed the true reports about his misconduct on the lies of a """" vast right-wing conspiracy. """"
John Oliver, the spirit animal of so much left-wing punditry, said on his post-election show that """" Trump is not normal.... He's a human,' What is wrong with this picture?' """" He added, """" But that is when you remember Mike f***ing Pence, who might be even worse -- because he looks like he's from the 1950s, but he thinks like he's from the 1650s. """" To Oliver, Trump is a """" racist """" """" Klan-backed, misogynist Internet troll, """" but Pence might be worse because he looks funny -- CENSOREDfrfrfr
I have long concurred with many of the points the Left makes about Trump, and some of those points are becoming more salient by the day. He really does seem frighteningly erratic, unprepared, sloppy. It's hard to believe he would provide reassuring leadership in the event of a foreign-policy crisis. And it's possible he committed obstruction of justice with respect to James Comey's investigation of Michael Flynn.
If Trump is a shock to the system, Pence is a cup of chamomile tea.
But as unprecedented as Trump is, Pence is just as precedented. As unheard-of as Trump's communication habits are, Pence's are equally heard-of. If Trump is a shock to the system, Pence is a cup of chamomile tea. If """" This is not normal """" is your mantra, you could hardly hope for a more normal Republican than Mike Pence.
"""" Normal Republican, """" though, the thing the Left has openly wished for all these months, reverts to being an CENSOREDfrfrfr His promotion would make progressives reach for the old playbook: Attack as a dangerous theocrat who hates women, minorities, and gays. No matter that the evidence for any of this is thin ( unlike, say, the evidence for Trump's volatility or unfitness ). Opposition to abortion, or even opposition to government funds being directed to the nation's leading abortion provider, will be recast as posing a supreme danger to """" women's health. """" Disagreeing that we need a federal bathroom policy will be recast as """" hate. """" It was completely unacceptable even to """" normalize """" the man who earned 306 electoral votes on November 8. But Pence will be called even more abnormal because he deflects questions about evolution as beyond his pay grade.
Because Pence is a man of faith, the ludicrous attempt to tie the secular, non-moralizing Trump to the neo-Puritan misogynist dystopia imagined in the new TV series The Handmaid's Tale will be recharged, only this time at 10,000 volts. Pence will be CENSOREDfrfrfr majority. We'll be told that Pence's misogyny is even more outlandish than Trump's because he declines to have boozy one-on-one dinners with women other than his wife. We'll hear lies about how Pence wants to electrocute gays to convert them to heterosexuality, or at very least that Pence hates gay Americans.
Democrats ca n't have it both ways: It ca n't be that the garden-variety conservatism epitomized by Pence is worse than Trumpism, and that Trump is a unique threat to the country because he is outside the mainstream. It ca n't be the case both that Trump is uniquely unfit for high office and that Pence, with 16 successful years in government inside as well as outside the Beltway, as both Washington legislator and chief executive of Indiana, is even more unfit for office. It ca n't be the case that a man who walks in on half-naked teenage beauty-pageant contestants while they're changing is as poor a role model as a man who is scrupulously correct and sober toward women.

Some graduating students are planning to silently protest Pence's presence at commencement by standing up and walking out of the ceremony just as the vice president starts his address.
Some friends and family in the audience may join in the walkout. The walkout is being organized by a collection of student activist groups on campus called We StaND For.
"""" We welcome anyone who wants to walk out with us, """" said Bryan Ricketts, a 2017 graduate and an organizer of the effort. The walkout will be silent so as not to disrupt the ceremony for the other graduates. """" We want to make it a graduation that's respectful of the students, """" he said.
Ricketts said Wednesday that CENSOREDfrfrfr participate in the walkout. The effort is being organized via a Facebook page and students are using the hashtag #WalkOutND.
Those involved say the walkout is intended to protest policies Pence pursued during his time as Indiana's governor ( 2013 to 2017 ) that targeted the state's most vulnerable residents, including LGBTQ individuals, immigrants and refugees.
In 2015, as Indiana's governor, Pence signed into law a """" religious freedom """" bill that would have allowed businesses and individuals to refuse services to LGBT people. After pressure from the business community and LGBT advocates, Pence signed into law a fix to the measure.
That same year, Pence ordered state agencies to halt resettlement for Syrian refugees after terrorist attacks in Europe. In response, Notre Dame President the Rev. John I. Jenkins issued a statement urging Americans to welcome Syrian refugees, noting they were being forced to flee their homeland because of unending violence.
Ricketts said some also may walk out in protest of Pence's support for President Donald CENSOREDfrfrfr n't plan to stop the walkout. The student organizers have contacted Notre Dame Security Police to make them aware of their plans, and said they will leave quietly.
"""" We would intervene in any protest only if the ceremony was seriously disrupted or anyone's safety was put at risk, """" Notre Dame spokesman Paul Browne said Wednesday via email. """" We expect neither. """"
Additional protests
There are a number of other protests of Pence being organized for Sunday.
Local protesters, led by We Go High! of St. Joseph County, Michiana Alliance for Democracy, South Bend Equality and Planned Parenthood Community Action Partners of Northwestern Indiana, plan to gather outside the main gates at Notre Dame Avenue and Angela Boulevard at 9:30 a.m.
Organizers expect as many as 1,000 participants, and perhaps as many as 2,000, based on recent events, including the marches for women and science in South Bend, and the response so far on Facebook.
April Lidinsky, with Planned Parenthood Community Action CENSOREDfrfrfr """" celebration for the former governor.
A professor at Indiana University South Bend, Lidinsky rejects Pence's views on women's health and reproductive health, including his commitment to defund Planned Parenthood and his strict stance on abortion, which """" counters sound medical decisions that women make with their doctors. """"
She also sees Pence's """" fingerprints all over """" the American Health Care Act, the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, which would, among other things, tighten restrictions on abortion and partially defund Planned Parenthood.
"""" Now that Trump is rapidly spiraling, Pence looks to a certain number of voters like a sober alternative, """" the former Notre Dame professor said, """" and a lot of us want to say we know Mike Pence well, and let us tell you why we've opposed him for so long. """"
Mary Ellen Hegedus is an organizer with We Go High! of St. Joseph County, a grassroots citizens group committed to strengthening and promoting the """" inalienable rights CENSOREDfrfrfr immigrants.
"""" We just thought with the vice president being in town... we needed to show up and say we are against the policies of this current administration, """" Hegedus said.
Among Hegedus' issues with the vice president: His support for a controversial religious liberty bill and his attempt to ban Syrian refugees from the state as governor.
Both women stressed that the protest is aimed at Pence, not the university.
"""" We're not protesting Notre Dame at all, """" Lidinski said. """" We're making sure Mike Pence knows we have our eye on him, and we've been following him for a long time. """"
"""" Vice President Pence has a right to speak anywhere he's invited, it's not a question of any of that, """" said Hegedus. """" It's just a chance to show our opposition to some of the policies that we feel are against human and environmental rights. """"
Recent anti-Trump protests have grown violent in some cases CENSOREDfrfrfr been instructed to stay on public property and not to venture onto campus and interfere with commencement in any way.
"""" We are being very respectful. It's a peaceful, respectful protest, """" Hegedus said. """" We want the graduates -- they've worked hard, and we want them to have their day. We are not going to interrupt that at all. """"
Threatening weather
The main concern for Sunday at this point, however, is weather, Browne said. The forecast calls for a chance of thunderstorms Sunday morning. A decision will be made Saturday night whether to proceed with commencement in Notre Dame Stadium or move the ceremony inside the Joyce Center.
An estimated 40,000 guests are expected to attend the ceremony in the football stadium. If the ceremony is moved indoors, the arena can hold only 9,000 people, so the number of guests admitted would be limited.
Although Notre Dame has a tradition of inviting sitting presidents to speak at commencement, thousands of students and CENSOREDfrfrfr Trump, stating that Trump's actions and priorities conflict with the Catholic university's values.
It is not known whether Notre Dame invited Trump. In March, the university announced that Pence would be the commencement speaker.
Guests are scheduled to begin entering Notre Dame Stadium for the commencement ceremony by 7 a.m. Sunday. The academic procession begins at 9 a.m., with the ceremony starting at 9:30 a.m.
Commencement protests are not new to Notre Dame. When President Barack Obama spoke at the commencement in 2009, anti-abortion activists protested for weeks in advance and on the day of the ceremony. There also were some protests last year, when Vice President Joe Biden and Republican U.S. House Speaker John Boehner jointly were presented with the university's Laetare Medal. """

On top of being wildly inappropriate, the sentiment reveals the stigma associated with sexually transmitted diseases.
"""" There are some misconceptions that STDs are a young person's problem or a gay man's problem, """" Ivanova told CNNTech.
The reality is that sexually transmitted infections are pervasive and on the rise. There are nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rates of contracting STDs are at an all-time high in the U.S.
"""" We always think it's somebody else's problem, """" added Ivanova, who said their customers range from millennials to senior citizens. myLABBox aims to normalize testing. Its online kits cost between $79 and $399 and test for everything from chlamydia, CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Boxes include all the materials for testing, like swabs, a container for urine and a package for collecting dry blood. Samples are sent in a prepaid envelope to certified labs for testing.
Because the startup is merely collecting samples, not testing those samples in people's home, it is n't regulated by the FDA. Instead, the tests are governed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and laboratory standards. Each state has reporting guidelines for communicating STD test results that companies like myLABBox have to follow.
myLABBox results are posted online within three to 11 days ; it provides a free virtual counseling session to those diagnosed with an STD and refers customers to telehealth doctors who can prescribe treatment.
For years, advocacy efforts have been focused on getting people into clinics to get tested, but the fact that infection rates are going up would seem to indicate that this is n't working.
"""" We realized this really was a delivery issue. So instead of trying to deliver the user to CENSOREDfrfrfr """" Ivanova said, adding that the kits are n't intended to replace visits to doctors but rather augment them. """" Testing should be just as easy and intuitive as every other aspect of our life. """"
myLABBox, which has partnered with Target, Walmart and Amazon to sell its kits online, is n't the only startup that thinks STD testing is in need of innovation. Others like Mately and GetTested also test for STDs. Austin-based EverlyWell sells at-home tests for STDS as well as things like food allergies and fertility. Cofounder Julia Cheek said the impetus for starting EverlyWell was also to remove the friction around testing.
"""" We talked to a lot of consumers who viewed lab testing as a really inconvenient, extensive process. It was also associated with a lack of transparency in terms of cost, """" said Cheek.
Planned Parenthood is also getting into this space. According to Planned Parenthood chief medical officer Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, there's more of a need than ever to expand options for care CENSOREDfrfrfr's reproductive health services. The House's health care bill would block Medicaid-covered patients from seeking care at Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood is piloting two apps that deliver STD kits to people in certain states. That's in addition to its traditional brick and mortar spaces, which are especially important in communities where Planned Parenthood is the only provider for low income women.
"""" We need to be doing both at the same time. Sexually transmitted infections are still a big public health problem in part because of stigma, """" said McDonald-Mosley.
MyLABBox cofounder Lara Ivanova
Ivanova says she is continually stressing to investors that her product is n't about sex -- it's about health.
"""" Sexual health is part of overall health, """" said Ivanova. """" In order for you to be healthy, all of you needs to be healthy. """" """

Planned Parenthood of the Heartland said on Thursday that a third of the state's clinics will be forced to close, leaving 14,600 patients without care. Those clinics are in Quad Cities, Burlington, Keokuk and Sioux City. The latter three clinics are in counties that have some of the highest rates of chlamydia in the state, according to Planned Parenthood. The same three clinics provided more than 80 percent of family planning services to people living in those counties.
Governor Terry Branstad, who looks set to become U.S. ambassador to China, signed a $1.7 billion health and human services appropriations bill on Friday. It blocks access to all Planned Parenthood services -- including cancer screenings and birth control -- through the state's family planning program. This is even though three of the state's 12 CENSOREDfrfrfr down, do n't provide abortion services. The bill directs the state to give up millions of dollars in federal Medicaid money and spend about $3 million in state funding for a family planning program beginning July 1 that excludes funding for clinics affiliated with organizations providing abortions.
The closures take effect on June 30.
"""" I am concerned about the health and well-being of the people in Iowa who now can no longer turn to their trusted health care provider, """" Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement on Thursday. """" What is happening in Iowa is what we could see across the country if Congress passes this dangerous law to defund Planned Parenthood. """"
She added: """" This is hardest on people who already face barriers to accessing health care -- especially people of color, young people, people with low to moderate incomes, and people who live in rural areas. """"
The clinic closures come at a crucial time for women seeking CENSOREDfrfrfr particularly in Iowa. Earlier this month, Branstad signed a bill not only banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy -- without exceptions for rape, incest, or fatal fetal abnormalities -- but making a 72-hour waiting period mandatory before an abortion. However, the waiting period was blocked by a court shortly after it was enacted, allowing dozens of women to go ahead with their scheduled procedures.
Iowa's move to block access to Planned Parenthood mirrors action by Texas in 2011. Texas similarly """" defunded """" the group in the state, resulting in nearly 30,000 fewer women receiving birth control and other care the organization provides. A loss of access to the injectable contraception from those clinics also resulted in a 27 percent increase in births, according to Planned Parenthood. """

Gov. Kim Guadagno and Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli staked out positions Thursday in their last debate before the New Jersey primary that served as a reminder of the relative moderation of the Republican Party in the state.
Ciattarelli, a businessman from Somerset County and the underdog in the race, challenged Guadagno on one of those fronts, attacking her support for rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Putting New Jersey back in the cap-and-trade program -- which Gov. Christie abandoned -- would raise electricity rates and give the state a competitive disadvantage, Ciattarelli said.
"""" We are having climate change, """" Guadagno said. """" We have to do something to respond to what's going on in this world. """"
Guadagno, a former prosecutor and Monmouth County sheriff, continued to hammer Ciattarelli over his tax plan, which would establish two new income-tax brackets for the state's highest earners at $750,000 and $1 million.
"""" The last time we CENSOREDfrfrfr the governor of the state of New Jersey, """" Guadagno said. Ciattarelli maintained the new brackets would be accompanied by cuts as part of a restructuring that """" lowers everyone's overall tax bill. """"
The final matchup between the candidates came less than three weeks before the June 6 primary. Guadagno and Ciattarelli qualified for the debate, held at NJTV's studio in Newark, based on fund-raising and election rules.
They continued to criticize each other's tax plans, with Ciattarelli blasting Guadagno's pledge to deliver $1.5 billion in property-tax relief as an """" irresponsible promise """" and calling her disingenuous for not first targeting inequity in the state's school-funding system.
Both were pressed by moderator Michael Aron on their plans. Ciattarelli said property taxes would n't skyrocket in cities like Camden and Newark despite his plan to require them to pay a larger share of their school costs. And Guadagno said she would be able to fund property-tax relief -- including with savings found through an audit of state government -- despite CENSOREDfrfrfr system and its school-funding formula.
On the topic of Planned Parenthood, Guadagno said that she was """" not in favor of abortions, but I am pro-choice. """"
"""" I do n't believe government has a place in my home, what I do with my body, """" Guadagno said, though neither she nor Ciattarelli supported restoring Christie's funding cuts to Planned Parenthood.
Both Ciattarelli and Guadagno said they supported decriminalizing marijuana, but not legalizing it. Guadagno said the state should """" streamline """" its existing medical marijuana program.
Guadagno has led Ciattarelli in polling, fund-raising, and county party support. But Ciattarelli has been trying to capitalize on a different advantage: his distance from the unpopular Christie.
He attacked Guadagno with the Christie administration's record Thursday, noting the 11 downgrades of the state's credit by the three major ratings agencies amid """" revenue shortfall after revenue shortfall after revenue shortfall, """" and the recent 23-cent hike in the state's gas tax.
"""" We CENSOREDfrfrfr said, arguing that he was the only Republican who could win in November.
Guadagno -- who promoted her """" record as a job creator """" during her 7? years in Christie's administration -- maintained that she had """" fundamental differences """" with the governor but had to play an appropriate role as his lieutenant. """" I have never walked down the hall and taken a piece of legislation off the governor's desk, """" Guadagno said. <h> More Coverage <h> Thanks for your continued support...

The campus chapter of Students for Life, a national group opposed to abortion, filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday alleging its members' free-speech rights were violated, and the group was subjected to viewpoint discrimination. The suit also accuses the school of violating club members' right to equal protection.
In the suit, the club argues the university's student government rejected the funding request that would have been used to help bring in an out-of-state college professor for a presentation on """" Abortion and Human Equality """" this spring. The suit states that the student government told the campus club that it does not supply money for speakers fees.
However, the suit says, the student government -- Associated Students Inc. -- funds the LGBTQA Pride and Gender Equity centers with nearly CENSOREDfrfrfr money was spent this year on presentations like """" Kink 101, """" a talk by a local """" sexologist. """"
Nathan Apodaca, president of the campus Students for Life club, called the funding decisions """" kind of a scam. """"
"""" Being required to pay for views you disagree with, but not ( get funding for ) your own views equally -- why would I want to pay for that? """" Apodaca said Thursday.
Asked for comment on the lawsuit, the university issued a statement that said: """" Cal State San Marcos is committed to fostering a campus environment where diverse ideas and views can be presented and discussed. In addition, we take student complaints and concerns very seriously. """"
Student activities fees, which this semester were $50 and will rise to $75 this fall, are mandatory for every student at the San Marcos campus. The fees go to the Associated Students group, which is a nonprofit entity. The student council -- called the board of directors -- CENSOREDfrfrfr board members could not be reached for comment Thursday. The 2016-17 board has completed its term and the new officers have n't yet been sworn in.
Leaders at the LBTQA Pride center and the Gender Equity center referred questions to the university's communications office.
The goal of the lawsuit is to gain equal access to the fees for all student groups, said attorney Tyson Langhofer, senior council for Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative advocacy law firm focused on religious freedom. His firm filed the case on behalf of Students for Life.
"""" It's really outrageous for any university to force students to pay for viewpoints that they agree with, while denying support for opposing points of view, """" Langhofer said.
Will Creeley, senior vice president of legal and public advocacy for the Foundation for Rights in Individual Education -- a nonprofit aimed at defending civil liberties in academia -- said the case will come down to whether the university is applying the same standard to all groups.
"""" The Supreme CENSOREDfrfrfr activities funds to be disbursed, they have to be disbursed in a viewpoint-neutral way, """" said """" They ca n't pick and chose who gets funds based on the viewpoint of the group. """"
Creeley said the plaintiffs will have to show evidence of a double standard or that the decision to deny funding was motivated by the viewpoint. However, if there is an objective, content-neutral rule that justifies the decision to deny funding, the plaintiffs """" will have an uphill climb. """"
He said, ironically, similar campus speech cases from 30 years ago """" involved LGBT groups that were denied funding and recognition. """"
This school year, the Associated Students' operating budget at CSUSM was nearly $1.4 million. Of that, $296,000 went to support the two centers and all of their programming -- more than 21 percent of the operating budget.
The student government also funds the student groups through its leadership fund, up to $500 a semester for approved uses. Speaker fees are not an approved CENSOREDfrfrfr clubs, including academic groups, religious groups, service clubs and special interest groups -- of which Students for Life is one. The Pride and Gender Equity centers are not considered student groups, but rather entities under the umbrella of the student government.
Still, Apodaca said, the rules should be the same for all.
"""" There is something really fishy going on here, """" he said. """" The school touts itself as a community that values diversity and individual perceptions. But some groups get far more funding that others. """"
The university's chapter of Students for Life has been around for three or four years and has roughly 30 members, according to Apodaca, a junior who took the reins after he transferred from Palomar College this school year.
Viewpoint discrimination complaints have led to legal actions elsewhere. Langhofer's firm filed a similar suit against Colorado State University, also on behalf of a Students for Life chapter ; that suit is pending.
And in 2014, the CENSOREDfrfrfr it was accused of denying a campus group $1,000 in student fees to put toward an event featuring a prominent opponent of affirmative action. """

Planned Parenthood of the Heartland said it planned to close four clinics across Iowa because of the recent budget signed into law by Gov. Terry Branstad, who pledged to """" defund """" the women's health organization.
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains announced it would close six clinics in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico as an efficiency measure largely unrelated to the political climate. One contributing factor was the health care law enacted under former president Barack Obama, which caused many existing clients who previously paid for their care out-of-pocket to qualify for Medicaid, which offers a lower reimbursement rate, officials said. Another was a desire to consolidate services in a new facility the organization plans to build in New Mexico.
Concern about political attacks did play a role, said Whitney Phillips, a spokeswoman for the affiliate, who said the goal is CENSOREDfrfrfr way. """"
The decision removes Planned Parenthood's presence entirely from Wyoming, which becomes the second state after North Dakota to have no Planned Parenthood centers. The organization concluded that other clinics could handle the 500 patients served by its health center in Casper, Phillips said. She added that the organization plans to continue to have a political and educational role in the state.
The closures come at a pivotal time for Planned Parenthood, a 100-year-old nonprofit that provides birth control, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, cancer screenings and other services at hundreds of clinics around the country. It is facing attacks at both the state and federal level over its role as the nation's largest abortion provider and a prominent proponent for abortion rights.
Congressional Republicans are seeking to cut Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled, with the House earlier this month passing a health-care bill that would do just that. Republican-led states also have sought to block taxpayer money from supporting CENSOREDfrfrfr tried to push back against the measures, arguing they could lead to gutting services for the millions of people who rely on the organization for their health care.
By law, federal funds can not be used to pay directly for abortions except in narrow circumstances. But antiabortion activists say taxpayer money should not support Planned Parenthood's non-abortion work.
In Iowa, an appropriations bill Branstad ( R ) signed last week ends a program that used mostly federal dollars to provide family planning services to low-income women. Branstad has said it will be replaced by a state-funded program that will direct funds to organizations that do not provide abortions. It follows a similar move by Texas four years ago.
Planned Parenthood officials say it will force the closure of clinics in Sioux City, Burlington and Keokuk, which will shutter June 30, as well as one health center in Quad Cities, which will continue to provide abortions until the building is sold. The closures will affect 14,676 patients, many of whom live in CENSOREDfrfrfr birth control, the organization says.
In three of the four Iowa counties where clinics are shuttering, Planned Parenthood served 80 percent or more of the women who received birth control at a publicly funded health center, officials said. In the case of Keokuk, women in that community will have to drive nearly an hour to find the closest provider of safety-net family planning services, they said.
"""" We will do everything we can to continue to care for as many patients as we can, """" Suzanna de Baca, president of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, said in a statement. """" However, the harsh reality is that, despite all our efforts, there will be women who fall through the cracks and lose access to health care because of this dangerous legislation. """"
Antiabortion groups celebrated the news that the Iowa clinics would shutter and suggested that other health centers could absorb the patients.
"""" This is good news for families in the state of Iowa, """" Maggie DeWitte, CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" There are many quality community health centers in Iowa that provide comprehensive health care to women and families across the state. And they do so without taking the life of precious human beings. """"

18525733,3763,17-05-19,US,Commonweal,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/signs-times,Signs of the Times,"Cardinal Blase J. Cupich speaks before the start of the tenth annual March for Life in Chicago.
This summer will mark the thirty-fifth anniversary of the installation of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as the twelfth bishop and seventh archbishop of Chicago. He served the archdiocese and the church with singular distinction, and is perhaps most remembered for his consistent-ethic-of-life approach to critical issues of the day. He was guided by three convictions: that there was a need to read the signs of the times ; that the church's social teaching had a role not just in deciding issues, but also in shaping and defining them ; and that the church was uniquely positioned institutionally to promote the common good in society. In pressing these convictions he was revolutionary -- and so it's no surprise that, even to this day, he has his critics.
But, nearly four decades after the 1983 address at Fordham University in which he introduced this framework, Bernardin deserves a fresh hearing. He CENSOREDfrfrfr reading the signs of our times, which I will propose here, makes it clear that the church's social teaching on solidarity, consistently applied across a full range of issues that impact our human interactions, is required. He understood that the urging of the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council to read the signs of the times required the church to be fully engaged in the world by being attentive to what was really happening in the lives of real people, the trends and forces influencing policies and public opinion. Only in this way could the church be viewed as a credible and authentic voice for speaking about human affairs. I suspect he would have liked how Pope Francis has captured that sentiment in his pithy phrase """" realities are greater than ideas. """"
Cardinal Blase J. Cupich blesses a rosary during a Thanksgiving dinner put on by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago.
In reading the signs of his times, Bernardin was concerned about the futility of treating issues like abortion, capital punishment, CENSOREDfrfrfr discrete topics. He understood how these issues were divisive in themselves. But he was convinced that a comprehensive commitment to respecting life as a principle connecting these issues would benefit them all. """" The purpose of proposing a consistent ethic of life, """" he said, """" is to argue that success on any one of the issues threatening life requires a concern for the broader attitude in society about respect for human life.... The viability of this principle depends upon the consistency of its application. """"
He knew as well that the integrity of Catholic social teaching made it uniquely suited as a framework for holding these issues together under a common principle. How was it, he asked, that the Catholic bishops, virtually alone among leadership groups in American society, found themselves witnessing ardently against both abortion and the nuclear-war policies of the United States? It was the integrity of its teaching -- that is, a consistent ethic of life, that set the church apart. As a result, Catholic social teaching would CENSOREDfrfrfr framework that governs American public life, then or now.
Yet this also explains the hostility to the consistent-ethic-of-life approach. It asserts that the integrity of Catholic social teaching can not be contoured to political divides. It asserts that Catholics are called to allegiance to their faith before allegiance to their partisan worldview. And it asserts that the integrity of Catholic teaching must not be undermined by diminishing the importance of key social teachings in political life, even to advance important political goals.
Cardinal Bernardin was also convinced that the church's social-policy role had to go beyond deciding key questions in the public debate, arguing it was just as important for the church to take the lead in defining such questions. This is how he put it in observing what was accomplished that same year by the bishops' pastoral letter The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response: """" The impact of the pastoral was due in part to its specific positions and conclusions, but it was also due to the way it CENSOREDfrfrfr other words, it shaped the debate going forward, which was also his intention in proposing a consistent ethic of life. Our Catholic faith, accompanied by our long intellectual tradition, he argued, is uniquely able to assist our society in framing the moral calculi we, as a nation, are called to make, to define the terms and the values that should shape our public-policy discussions and decisions, to offer the moral and human vocabulary that is so often lacking in the technocratic paradigms dominant in our culture.
The final principle that guided him was that the church should recognize that it is well positioned as an institution to implement a reshaping of public policy. Our worship, pastoral life, ministries of health care, and education all provide a platform of lived experience where the integrity of Catholic social teaching is on display. In fact, he readily admitted in his Fordham address that he intentionally chose a Catholic university to introduce his consistent-ethic-of-life approach to church teaching, appreciative of the fact that a Catholic CENSOREDfrfrfr As a community and institution committed to the examination and testing of ideas, a Catholic university does more than repeat and summarize those ideas. Rather, he noted, universities have the noble vocation of determining the impact of new ideas and reflecting on the possibilities for development latent in them.
In fact, I am convinced that the legacy of the cardinal's contribution has been enhanced over the years as Catholic universities live up to his challenging vision. Consider how his words and example have had a continuing impact:
1. There is more awareness of the role of conscience in public life, and the moral dimensions of issues of life and death, war and peace, and who moves ahead and who is left behind in economic life.
2. The substance and language of the consistent ethic of life are in many ways reflected in Catholic teaching, including the U.S. bishops' statements on faithful citizenship and Pope Francis's powerful metaphor of a """" throw-away culture. """"
3. Decades after CENSOREDfrfrfr, and increasingly young pro-life movement is challenging the violence of abortion and offering life-giving alternatives to abortion to women and children.
4. The use of the death penalty is diminishing as prosecutors, juries, and Catholic and other Americans make the case that you can not teach that killing is wrong by killing.
5. The church and other moral voices in public life increasingly reflect Cardinal Bernardin's efforts to engage and persuade, not simply to proclaim and judge on issues of life and death, justice and peace.
6. Catholic social teaching, which was often a centerpiece of Cardinal Bernardin's legacy, is increasingly seen as a central part of Catholic life, guiding the church's participation in public life.
7. There is increased understanding of the connections between issues of human life and human dignity ( among young people in particular ), care for """" the least of these """" and care for creation, the pursuit of justice and respect for others.
Cardinal Bernardin's call CENSOREDfrfrfr across political, ideological, and ecclesial lines is reflected in the best of Catholic and interfaith witness and advocacy. In short, many life issues formerly treated in isolation and considered unrelated are now discussed in the same context and within a shared moral framework.
Catholic social teaching would not and could not be fitted into a partisan political framework
What Cardinal Bernardin did in introducing his consistent ethic of life was nothing short of revolutionary, which is why he had his critics -- both within and outside the church. Some unfairly charged that his approach ended up making all life issues morally equivalent. Others suggested that the consistent ethic of life diminishes a commitment to resist abortion. He disagreed, and so do I. A full and consistent commitment to human life and dignity and to solidarity will enhance, not diminish, our defense of children and women victimized by the violence of abortion. As Pope Francis has said, """" It is not' progressive' to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life. CENSOREDfrfrfr, despite suffering the distortions and misunderstanding of his critics, Bernardin lived long enough to see the impact of his approach. And I suspect he smiled when he heard Saint John Paul II use the phrase a """" consistent ethic of life """" in an address to a group of U.S. bishops in 1993 on the meaning and purpose of human sexuality. It is also noteworthy that the Holy See used the term in addressing the United Nations on the need to safeguard the human rights of all forcibly displaced people.
But the best way to honor what he did is to apply in our day the three convictions that guided him. What are the signs of the times? What can we retrieve from our Catholic social teaching to present challenges? And how can our institutional resources be used to shape a response going forward?
The world has changed a great deal over the past thirty-five years -- or for that matter, the past two. Our time is plagued by global terrorism and threatened by global warming and CENSOREDfrfrfr by unchecked forces of economic exploitation and globalization, and others are left homeless or forced to migrate by wars and privation. As a result, we have become fearful of one another in a world marked by great divisions over race, ethnicity, religion, and place of origin.
Without oversimplifying, the challenge for us today is not only that the issues are in silos, separated one from another ; it is also that people, in their social networks and through the media they consult, are in silos, bereft of challenge or debate, isolated by differences of opinion or politics, race or social class, in a way that obscures our shared humanity and the ties that historically have united us as a nation of immigrants. It is not too strong to say that this sense of disconnectedness is being legitimized not only by voices in the streets, but also by those in the halls of governance here and around the world, giving rise to xenophobia, nationalism, populism, and racial intolerance. CENSOREDfrfrfr influences that only further divide while pretending to offer as solutions distorted views of the role of the economy and politics, how we relate to other nations, and how to deal with global conflicts.
I am convinced that just as Cardinal Bernardin proposed that an ethic of life be consistently applied to unite all life issues, we need in our day to mine the church's social teaching on solidarity, as a means of uniting humanity through a reawakening of our interdependence as a human family, which Pope John Paul II called for in his groundbreaking encyclical Sollicitudo rei socialis, and which Pope Francis is advocating in his writings. Solidarity needs to be applied consistently to all our human interactions, John Paul II wrote three decades ago, calling us to """" see the' other' -- whether a person, people or nation... as our' neighbor,' a' helper'... a sharer, on a par with ourselves, in the banquet of life to which all are equally invited by God. CENSOREDfrfrfr need """" to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic, military, or political imperialism, and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration. This is precisely the act proper to solidarity among individuals and nations. """"
We should not be na? ve about the resistance that an ethic of solidarity, consistently applied, will meet. It will make demands on how we live our personal lives, and how we view our national agenda and our role in the family of nations. But the first demand according to the Compendium of Catholic Social Teaching is that it will require """" men and women of our day to cultivate a greater awareness that they are debtors of the society of which they have become a part. They are debtors because of those conditions that make human existence livable, and because of the indivisible and indispensable legacy constituted by culture, scientific and technical knowledge, material and immaterial goods, and by all that the human CENSOREDfrfrfr be recognized in the various forms of social interaction, """" the compendium continues, """" so that humanity's journey will not be interrupted but remain open to present and future generations, all of them called together to share the same gift in solidarity. """"
Solidarity produces the kind of social-market economy that John Paul II advocated
Let me now offer some examples of what an ethic of solidarity consistently applied to the range of issues of our day looks like. The principle of solidarity would critique a narrow approach to the economy that uses a one-dimensional measure of the economic growth of a nation, singularly defined by profits, that promotes policies that maximize the freedom of markets and individual choice, and that believes that market forces left to themselves are the best -- indeed, the only -- arbiters of economic progress. This narrow approach has produced """" an economy that kills, """" as Pope Francis has said. In its place, a consistent ethic of solidarity would argue that inclusion and economic security for all are CENSOREDfrfrfr decision-making. Solidarity produces the kind of social-market economy that John Paul II advocated, which involves, as Pope Francis noted, passing from a liquid economy """" directed at revenue profiting from speculation and lending at interest, to a social economy that invests in persons creating jobs and providing training. """"
Solidarity also challenges a transactional approach to international relations. I have already quoted from John Paul II's Sollicitudo rei socialis, which called world leaders to recognize the interdependence of all members of the human family and to promote a solidarity that serves peace and human development and unites rich and poor in a relationship that lifts up the most vulnerable.
John Paul II also wrote in that encyclical that it would be a desertion of a nation's moral obligation for it to care only for its own well-being: """" If a nation were to succumb more or less deliberately to the temptation to close in upon itself and failed to meet the responsibilities following from its superior position in the community of nations, it would fall CENSOREDfrfrfr His words have much to say to us in the present climate, on a number of levels. Today, the lines between nationalism and patriotism seem to be blurred. San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy reminded us in his talk at the Erroneous Autonomy symposium this past year that our nation's sense of being exceptional has never been a done deal ; it has always been an aspiration, a work in progress, something that we strive to live up to in each generation. Pope Francis said as much in his closing remarks to the joint session of Congress in 2015: """" A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as Lincoln did ; when it fosters a culture that enables people to' dream' of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do ; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work. """"
John Paul II's words about a leading nation's moral obligation in building CENSOREDfrfrfr the calls to reignite an arms race, which from all angles will seriously reduce the capacity of our nation to address the root causes of violence in our world: social, political, and economic exclusion.
The question is not whether there should be military spending, but what is the needed proportion so that other ways of making us safe, secure, and whole are not neglected. Our nation already spends more on its military than any other nation on earth. It has been estimated that the world spent about $1.6 trillion on military funding in 2015. U.S. military spending amounted to about 37 percent of this total, equaling the spending of the next seven nations with the largest military budgets -- and many of those seven are our allies.
At the same time, dramatic cuts are being proposed in poverty-reducing humanitarian and development assistance that helps address the root causes of conflict. Here is a small sample gleaned by staff at Catholic Relief Services, the official relief and development agency of the U.S. bishops CENSOREDfrfrfr at a time with a record number of famines ; a 20 percent cut in development assistance that funds such priorities as basic education, democracy-building initiatives, human rights, agriculture, and employment ; a 17 percent cut in U.S. refugee admissions at a time when the number of displaced people is at its highest since World War II ; dramatic reductions in key global health programs, including a 13 percent cut in the fight against polio, a 13 percent cut in nutrition assistance, a 34 percent cut to an account for vulnerable children, a 19 percent cut for addressing tuberculosis, and many others.
Surveys show that if you ask the average American how much of our federal budget is spent on international assistance, they answer between 20 and 25 percent. If you ask them, how much the U.S. should spend, they say 10 percent. When they find out that non-military international aid is less than 1 percent, they are incredulous. What would it mean if funding levels actually reflected the values average Americans CENSOREDfrfrfr These are but a few examples of how an ethic of solidarity, consistently applied to the full range of issues that impact our human living, has the potential of reshaping the debate at a time the nation and the world are deeply divided, and vulnerable to influences that only deepen the fears at the heart of that division. An ethic of solidarity offers a language and a vision, reminding us who we are as a nation -- but also what it means to live together in this common home, as the Holy Father calls Earth in Laudato si'.
Cardinal Bernardin's consistent ethic of life has led me to once again take up the work of reading the signs of the times and pursuing a path that aspires to define the issues of the day so that the good of humanity will be served by our witness. Just as he did in his day, I now leave it up to all Catholics, and especially Catholic universities, to reflect on and develop ways to apply the church's CENSOREDfrfrfr. We continue to be haunted by the threat of nuclear war and nuclear weapons. Headlines about North Korea and the ongoing debates about Iran's nuclear ambitions highlight the continuing wisdom of the pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons. The number of abortions has gone down significantly in the United States, but the violence of abortion continues to haunt our society, and there are new pressures to require cooperation with what we believe is the taking of innocent human life. Our nation is still divided about whether decent healthcare is a human right or a commodity that depends on personal resources. In some states assisted suicide is advocated, in the knowledge that the pressures to end life will probably be more severe on the poor, the isolated, those with disabilities, and those without access to palliative care. The question of national priorities continues to haunt us as leaders advocate steep increases in military spending, renewed investment in nuclear arms, and cuts in the safety net at home and in diplomacy and development around the world CENSOREDfrfrfr surprised if voices are raised in opposition to an ethic of solidarity, for when consistently applied, it will make demands on us all.
Cardinal Bernardin was convinced that the church should not shy away from her unique contribution, even if it meant standing apart from the prisms of political decision-making used by other groups, even if the integrity of our social teaching was met with hostility because it could not be made to fit into the partisan political framework that governs American public life. But, as we remain undaunted in our witness to the world, let us also take up the task before us in a way that does not confuse firmness and resolve with a lack of respect for others in the debate. It would be good to once again return to Cardinal Bernardin's talk at Fordham, which he closed with sage advice about carrying on the debate of serious public issues with civility and mutual respect: """" I suggest, """" he offered, """" a style governed by the following rule: We should CENSOREDfrfrfr our civil courtesy. We should be vigorous in stating a case and attentive in hearing another's case ; we should test everyone's logic but not question his or her motives. """"
He could offer that advice because he was convinced that the church had so much more to offer the world than what could be gained by the world's approval. Pope Francis calls us to that same sense of pride as he presses forward in building a world marked by solidarity, unafraid of how our witness will be received: """" Serving means working beside the neediest of people, establishing with them first and foremost human relationships of closeness and bonds of solidarity. Solidarity, this is a word that frightens the developed world. People try to avoid saying it. Solidarity to them is almost a bad word. But it is our word. """"

His nine-day tour will then take him to Jerusalem, the West Bank, Rome, Brussels, and Sicily.
Walter Pincus, who has one of the longest memories in Washington, sees parallels between the president's first foreign trip and a journey Richard Nixon took to the Middle East as Watergate consumed his presidency in June 1974. It came at the very time the Watergate special prosecutor was in court seeking the actual White House tapes of presidential conversations ( do such tapes exist now? ) and congressional committees were beginning to look into impeachment. """" Back then, ironically, Nixon visited leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Israel in an unsuccessful attempt to strengthen the ceasefire agreement that halted fighting in the Yom Kippur, Arab-Israeli war, """" Walter writes for the Cipher Brief. """" Nixon returned home to challenge and lose his Supreme Court argument over the tapes that set him down the path to resigning the CENSOREDfrfrfr side, David Ignatius notes in his column that """" domestic scandals can have the odd effect of encouraging diplomacy abroad """": """" Nixon made major peace deals in the Middle East after the Watergate debacle began. But even so, that story did n't end happily for Nixon or the United States. """"
-- While many presidents have tried to use statesmanship abroad to distract from their problems at home, the Trump brand of diplomacy has some analysts worried that the tour might only make his troubles worse, Post diplomatic correspondents Anne Gearan and Carol Morello write in a preview of what to expect.
James Carafano, a foreign policy expert at the Heritage Foundation who has close ties to the White House, told them that an overseas trip presents a real opportunity, given all the turmoil in Washington. """" Just being out of town for two weeks is probably great, """" he said. """" The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda CENSOREDfrfrfr on one of these trips, it's nobody's fault but your own. """"
-- Despite Trump's brooding and desperation to turn the page, the truth is that he does n't really want to go abroad. """" In recent days, Mr. Trump has groused to several friends that he is not looking forward to leaving his new White House cocoon, """" Maggie Haberman and Mike Shear report in the New York Times. """" At one point, he barked at an aide that he thought his first tour abroad should be only about half as long. He will have to abandon his well-known preference for sleeping in his own bed ( or in one at the hotels or golf resorts he owns ) as he hops between... places without a Trump-branded property.... In private, Mr. Trump's advisers acknowledge that they are concerned about his off-script eruptions, his tendency to be swayed by flattery and the possibility that foreign leaders may present him with situations he does not know how to handle. They worry CENSOREDfrfrfr, and they have tried to caution him about various scenarios. """"
-- The cloud hanging over Trump will follow him and his entourage past the water's edge. Michael Birnbaum reports from Brussels: """" Washington's closest allies in Europe are increasingly worried that rising political chaos in the United States is undermining the strength of the most powerful nation in the world. In conversations with more than two dozen current and former European ministers, lawmakers, diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers in recent days, there was a common theme:.... Many fear that mounting domestic scandals could sap Washington's ability to respond to challenges ranging from Russia to terrorism to North Korea. """" The quotes in the story paint a portrait of a continent on edge:
"""" It's disturbing, """" said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who works on U.S. affairs. """" The vacuum may encourage people all over the world to seize the moment of an absent United States. """"
"""" One senior CENSOREDfrfrfr possession of information that was incriminating to Trump or his circle, it would hold back from sharing with the United States for fear the U.S. president would seek revenge. """"
-- Israel was supposed to be one of the easiest stops on Trump's tour, but it has become the most awkward for a host of reasons. It offers another case study, if you needed one, of the challenges such an inexperienced president faces as he tries to tackle complex problems.
This is how the visit is playing in today's Jerusalem Post: """" As the city is poised to line its streets with festive American flags, a trip that was expected to be one long, smiling photo-op has suddenly gone way off script, as the spring love affair comes closer to hitting the reality of the summer heat in the Middle East. """"
The top-secret information Trump slipped to the Russians during their Oval Office meeting last week came from an Israeli source, according to severalnews reports. Multiple U.S. officials have said CENSOREDfrfrfr on external plotting by the Islamic State. Iran is one of Israel's biggest enemies and Russia's closest allies. Trump's disclosure possibly puts the source and lives at risk, as well as undermines the war effort against ISIS, experts say. This intelligence was so sensitive that the U.S. was not even permitted to share it with our closest allies who we share other super-sensitive information with as part of standard practice.
White Houseofficials then let it be known this week that Trump will not move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at least for now. There had been some internal conversations about using this trip to do so as a way to follow through on one of the president's signature campaign promises, but he was persuaded by career diplomats and Arab leaders that doing so would complicate efforts to negotiate peace.

Adding insult to injury has been a donnybrook CENSOREDfrfrfr reported that during a planning meeting between U.S. and Israeli officials, the Israelis were told that Trump's visit to the Western Wall was private, Israel did not have jurisdiction in the area and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not welcome to accompany Trump there, """" according to Reuters. """" The statement that the Western Wall is in an area in the West Bank was received with shock, """" said an official in Netanyahu's office.
During a briefing about the trip, national security adviser H.R. McMaster twice refused to answer reporters' questions about whether Trump believes the Western Wall is part of Israel. Press secretary Sean Spicer also declined to answer, saying only that it is """" in Jerusalem. """"
Meanwhile, pro-Israel hard-liners inside the Trump administration are sending the opposite messages. """" The Western Wall is part of Israel, and I think that is how we have always seen it, """" U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Tuesday. And the new U.S. ambassador CENSOREDfrfrfr straight to the wall after landing at the airport.
Another story souring the mood of Israelis is Trump's cancellation of a planned visit to and speech at Masada. After authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the ancient mountain fortress ( a UNESCO-listed site ), he said he'd rather not go at all. Newsweek's Jack Moore notes that both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were perfectly happy to take the cable car up. ( I hiked to the top when I went in 2013. )
A visit to Jerusalem's impressive Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, was also cut short at Trump's request. Local press reports say he's scheduled to drop by for just 15 minutes, despite requests that he spend much longer. That is barely enough time to sign a guest book.

-- The cover story in next week's Economist, aptly enough, is about the legacy of the Six-Day War: """" Unexpectedly, there may be a new opportunity to make peace: Trump wants to secure' the ultimate deal'.... Netanyahu appears as nervous as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, seems upbeat about Trump.... The outlines of peace are well known.... The fact that such a deal is familiar does not make it likely. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas will probably string out the process -- and try to ensure the other gets blamed for failure. Distracted by scandals, Mr Trump may lose interest ; Mr Netanyahu may lose power ( he faces several police investigations ) ; and Mr Abbas may die ( he is 82 and a smoker ). The limbo of semi-war and semi-peace is, sadly, a tolerable option for both. """"
The settlements remain a big hurdle. Trump has backed away from the decades-old U.S. commitment to a Palestinian state, though he had CENSOREDfrfrfr. William Booth, in a great story from Bethlehem that just posted, explains how Palestinian payments to prisoners and the families of """" martyrs """" will be a very big challenge for the two sides in any serious peace talks. ( Read it here. )
If you looked at Trump's itinerary four months ago, all these problems with Israel would have been surprising. Trump exempted the Jewish state from his tough-talking, isolationist rhetoric during the campaign. He repeatedly said no one loves the country more than he does, and Netanyahu said Israel has """" no greater friend """" than Trump when he took office.

-- James Comey prepared extensively for his discussions with Trump because he was so concerned the president was unlikely to respect legal and ethical boundaries between the White House and the FBI. That's also why Comey took detailed notes of their encounters afterwards.Devlin Barrett, Ellen Nakashima and Adam Entous have another scoop: """" FBI associates recounted how CENSOREDfrfrfr in which they brainstormed how to handle moments in which the president asked for details of an investigation. One associate referred to Comey's preparation as a kind of' murder board' -- a phrase used to describe a committee of questioners that hurls tough questions at someone as practice for a difficult oral examination.' He was pretty insistent that he would have to find a way to politically not answer it,' one associate recalled.' He was confident that he was not going to sacrifice the independence of the investigation, or his own moral compass, but at the same time, he would not try to purposely inflame his commander in chief.' Before going to the dinner, Comey practiced Trump's likely questions and his answers... in part to ensure he did not give Trump any ammunition to use against him later. """" One associate recalled there were times when, after meeting with Trump, Comey started writing notes as soon as he got into a car, """" to make sure he could CENSOREDfrfrfr significant development: Comey told Trump that, if he wanted to know details about the ongoing FBI investigations, he should not contact him directly but instead follow the proper procedures and have the White House counsel send his inquiries to the Justice Department, the New York Times' Michael Schmidt reports on this morning's front page: """" After explaining to Mr. Trump how communications with the F.B.I. should work, Mr. Comey believed he had effectively drawn the line after a series of encounters he had with the president and other White House officials that he felt jeopardized the F.B.I.' s independence. The day after the Michael Flynn conversation, however, Reince Priebus... asked Mr. Comey to help push back on reports in the news media that Mr. Trump's associates had been in contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. """"
-- Lawfare editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes, a close Comey friend, says that the ousted FBI director was deeply unsettled by what he believed were personal efforts by the president to compromise or implicate CENSOREDfrfrfr was """" disgusted """" when Trump, two days after his inauguration, tried to hug him. The FBI director told Wittes he """" really did not want to attend """" and went so far as to try camouflage his dark blue suit with the blue drapes in the back of the room before Trump spotted him. When Trump finally did single him out -- """" He's become more famous than me! """" -- Comey told Wittes that he emphatically did not want any show of warmth. He regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before Democrats who already mistrusted him.
"""" On March 27, he described one incident in particular that had bothered him. Comey was about to get on a helicopter when his phone rang. It was the White House saying that the President wanted to speak with him. Figuring there must be something urgent going on, he delayed his flight to take the call. To his surprise, the President just wanted CENSOREDfrfrfr Comey related and indeed, he regarded the call as weird for how substanceless it was. What bothered Comey was twofold -- the fact that the conversation happened at all ( why was Trump calling him to exchange pleasantries? ) and the fact that there was an undercurrent of Trump's trying to get him to kiss the ring. """"
As a general observation, Wittes notes thatComey was """" preoccupied """" throughout this period with the need to protect the FBI from inquiries on investigative matters from the White House: """" While I do not know how many incidents we're talking about, how severe they were, or their particular character, I do know this: Comey understood Trump's people as having neither knowledge of nor respect for the independence of the law enforcement function. And he saw it as an ongoing task on his part to protect the rest of the Bureau from improper contacts and interferences from a group of people he did not regard as honorable. This was a general preoccupation of Comey's in CENSOREDfrfrfr Do n't forget as these shoes continue to drop: Comey is a Republican.
-- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein indicated to Senate lawmakers during a classified briefing that, contrary to the White House's version of events, he knew Comey would be fired before he wrote the memo that was used as justification for the dismissal.
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) said his takeaway from Rosenstein's briefing is that the focus of the FBI's investigation has shifted: """" It was a counterintelligence investigation until now. It seems to me now to be considered a criminal investigation. """"
Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) said Rosenstein refused to answer """" completely appropriate """" questions asked by his colleagues, our colleagues report. But several Republicans asked Rosenstein if the Intelligence Committee could continue its work now that Mueller is conducting his investigation, and Rosenstein was """" unequivocal """" that the panel can and should continue its investigation, according to one attendee.
-- During the session, Rosenstein faced especially aggressive questions from CENSOREDfrfrfr Jeff Sessions was involved in Comey's firing when he had recused himself and what his role is in selecting a new FBI director. Ed O'Keefe has some buzzy inside details: """" Kirsten Gillibrandand Al Franken especially grilled Rosenstein on Sessions's role and the scope of Mueller's new investigation... Another aide familiar with the exchange described Franken as' heated.' But one of the senators asked to recount the meeting said that Franken and Gillibrand were' passionate' -- not rude. Rosensteinconfirmed that Mueller's investigation will have a broad scope -- encouraging news to Democrats especially eager for an investigation to cover all potential angles. Because of the wide berth, Rosenstein referred several of the senators' questions to Mueller, which caused much of the frustration in the room. """"
-- On Capitol Hill, the race is on to see who can land Comey's first public appearance. Paul Kane reports: """" Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, operating the highest-profile investigation of Russian interference, are trying to reschedule a CENSOREDfrfrfr in private Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a formal request for Comey to come before the panel... And not to be outdone, House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz... announced on Twitter that he had scheduled a hearing for Comey next week -- before he had made contact with the former FBI director. """" Every panel believes Comey should still testify even with Muller in place: """" Lawmakers can barely hide their ambition at landing what would be a grand media spectacle. It's a lot like Barbara Walters and other TV personalities fighting over the first interview with a Hollywood starlet beset by scandal. """"
-- Trump has expressed hope that Michael Flynn could rejoin the administration in some capacity after the FBI investigation concludes, The Daily Beast reports: """" The president's continued loyalty to his ousted former aide is so strong, in fact, that the two have remained in touch despite the potential that their communication could be portrayed as White House interference in a federal investigation.' He did not CENSOREDfrfrfr, a friend of the retired Army general.' He did n't want to be in the government. He wanted to go back to private life. But Trump insisted on it.' Flynn was' reluctant but honored' when offered the post, according to a senior Trump administration official, and only accepted it at the president's urging.... Several sources said Trump has expressed his hopes that a resolution of the FBI's investigation in Flynn's favor might allow Flynn to rejoin the White House... a scenario some of Trump's closest advisers in and outside the West Wing have assured him absolutely should not happen.' Trump feels really, really, really bad about firing him, and he genuinely thinks if the investigation is over Flynn can come back,' said one White House official. One former FBI official and a second government official said Trump thought he owed Flynn for how things ended up and was determined to clear Flynn's name and bring him back to the White House. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr a message from Trump:' STAY STRONG,' """" by Yahoo News' Michael Isikoff: """" Saddled with steep legal bills, Flynn wanted to reconnect with old friends and talk about potential future business opportunities....' I just got a message from the president to stay strong,' Flynn said after the dinner was over, according to two sources who are close to Flynn and are familiar with the conversation, which took place on April 25. """"
-- Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said Flynn has not responded to a subpoena from his panel in its ongoing Russia investigation, which was issued last week after he refused to cooperate with an April 28 request for documents. The AP reports: """" Legal experts say it's unlikely Flynn would agree to turn over the personal documents because he would be waiving his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by doing so. Flynn, though his lawyer, had earlier asked for immunity from' unfair prosecution' in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with the committee. """" CENSOREDfrfrfr INVESTIGATION:
-- Trump convened his legal team yesterday for a strategy session. Politico's Alex Isenstadt and Josh Dawsey report: """" One White House official said the discussion... centered around the nuts and bolts of how the investigation would work - and how the administration will need to handle the inquiry. Among those in attendance was longtime Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen, who came down from New York to attend. White House Counsel Don McGahn and his team are urging the White House - and Trump - to be cautious in its comments with a special prosecutor involved. McGahn has begun explaining to aides in detail about records retention and potential requests, two people familiar with the conversations say. One objective: to keep Trump from hurting himself any further. Two senior administration officials said they believed Trump's letter firing Comey was a mistake. Some aides have begun reaching out to lawyers to see if they need ( their own ) counsel. """"
-- A longtime private attorney who represented Trump for more than CENSOREDfrfrfr the president really needs to hire a """" tough Washington lawyer """" to help navigate the special counsel investigation. """" He needs a good lawyer, someone who is strong, not that he would go against the lawyer's advice, but everybody should have a lawyer who sees things through and comes up with good advice, """" Jay Goldberg told The Post's Michael Kranish, who adds: """" Trump's need for a private attorney is viewed as a high priority because he so far has been relying on government lawyers, including his White House counsel, who could eventually be called to testify about their private conversations with him.... Trump's constant tweeting about subjects under investigation... could undermine efforts to cite executive privilege, analysts said. """"
-- Trump has signaled that he is likely to hire a new lawyer to join his defense team, but he has not yet made a final decision. From the New York Times' Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush: """" The president is said to recognize that CENSOREDfrfrfr he is deeply cautious in selecting people he trusts, and he adds new people to his orbit slowly.... Some of Mr. Trump's advisers and allies... are pushing him to move at an accelerated pace. """"
A DEFIANT PRESIDENT -- WHO STILL CA N'T GET HIS STORY STRAIGHT:
-- Trump again denied asking Comey to obstruct any FBI investigation.Ashley Parker and David Nakamura report: Asked at a new conference whether he urged Comey to ease up, the president said: """" No. No. """" Then he ordered the media to move on to the """" next question. """" Trump also repeated his claim that the decision to appoint a special counsel to look into possible collusion with Russia was """" a witch hunt. """" """" I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt, and there is no collusion between -- certainly myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians. Zero, """" Trump said. """" Believe me, there's CENSOREDfrfrfr Comey's account of their encounter, Trump's comments also put him into stark opposition with Rosenstein, who appointed the special counsel and whose memo criticizing Comey was initially used as justification by the White House to explain the president's decision to fire his FBI director. The president himself later said he had long disliked Comey and made up his mind to fire him before Rosenstein presented him with his memo... But during the news conference, Trump contradicted both his own account and that of Rosenstein. """" """" Director Comey was very unpopular with most people, """" Trump said. """" I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know from Rosenstein. """"
Even though a Trump appointee decided to name the special counsel, Trump claimed that it was actually """" a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election """" and """" hurts our country terribly """": """" It shows we're a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country, """" he said during a lunch with television anchors at the White CENSOREDfrfrfr it shows that we're not together as a country.

WHAT DID THE VICE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?
-- Pence has begun tiptoeing much more gingerly in recent days as scandal has engulfed the White House. From the Associated Press's Ken Thomas and Catherine Lucey: """" It has n't been easy, and it's getting harder by the day.... And there are fresh questions about how much Pence knew as head of Trump's transition team. The vice president was under new scrutiny Thursday after reports that Flynn in January alerted the transition team about a Justice Department inquiry into whether he was secretly working as a foreign lobbyist for Turkish interests. An administration official said Thursday that Pence knew nothing about Flynn's activities at the time and referred to the CENSOREDfrfrfr March in which Pence said,' Hearing that story today was the first I heard of it.' """"
-- Pence's people inside the White House are apparently beginning to leak in an effort to protect the vice president. This could foreshadow a significant rupture. It appears that the ambitious Pence's emerging strategy to save his own political future is to insist that he was out of the loop, but this is a risky play because it makes him look less powerful and it will backfire badly if a smoking gun emerges to show that he knew more than he's let on.
An unnamed source close to Pence told NBC News last night that the Veep was kept totally in the dark about Flynn's alleged wrongdoings. This person complained that it is part of a """" pattern. """" """" That's an egregious error -- and it has to be intentional, """" the source close to Pence told NBC. """" It's either malpractice or intentional, and either are unacceptable. """" Vaughn CENSOREDfrfrfr fall campaign, reports on the fuller context: """" This would be the second time that Pence claims he was kept in the dark about possible Flynn wrongdoings, despite the White House's alleged knowledge of them. Earlier this year, Pence said he was not made aware of Flynn's discussions with Russian officials until 15 days after Trump and the White House were notified. The source... is now saying that Pence and his team were not made aware of any investigation relating to Flynn's work as a foreign agent for Turkey. """" This Pence loyalist tried to place the blame on White House counsel McGahn for not alerting the V.P., who was head of the transition.
--The last few days have taken a physical toll on Pence and he's kept a very low public profile, per CNN's Elizabeth Landers. He even skipped the weekly Senate GOP lunch: """" Though Pence will continue to be a' loyal soldier' because he is a' relentlessly positive guy,' he' looks tired CENSOREDfrfrfr certainly knew we needed to be prepared for the unconventional,' but, the source adds,' not to this extent.' """"
-- Are Pence's loyalists telling the truth? Or are they just trying to save their boss? """" There are two possible defenses for Pence here, """" The Post's Aaron Blake writes: """" The first is that maybe McGahn did n't pass this information along to Pence. This does n't make much sense, though, given that Pence was leading the transition effort. That would be gross negligence on McGahn's behalf. The second is that, even if Pence knew about it, perhaps he was referring strictly to the reports about Flynn having just filed as a foreign agent when he said it was the first he'd heard of it. But that would be highly, highly misleading -- at best. """"

John Bush is not a fan of Sen. Ted Cruz. Bush, a conservative political blogger who went by the pseudonym """" G. Morris, """" wrote last year during the Republican national convention that the Texas senator was a """" sore loser """" for not endorsing Trump and had exercised """" poor judgment. """"
Bush is n't just a blogger, though. A prominent lawyer in Kentucky, he's one of President Trump's nominees for a federal appeals court judgeship. Which means he'll have to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- of which Cruz is a member.
From 2007 to 2016, Bush wrote more than 400 posts on the blog """" Elephants in the Bluegrass. """" Most of his posts are about politics -- on the national stage and in his home state CENSOREDfrfrfr paper trail for the Senate to dissect as they consider his nomination to the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
Lawyers can deflect criticism about controversial cases they've handled by saying that they were representing the interests of their client. Sitting judges nominated to other courts can say that opinions they've written were based on earlier precedent and established law. But Bush's blog posts reflect his personal opinions, and they touch on a number of issues that could come up at his confirmation hearing.
Bush wrote about his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which is still the subject of litigation, and in September he called for it to be repealed and replaced. He's expressed opposition to public financing of political campaigns, called the idea of trying terrorists in civilian courts """" bone-headed, """" and wrote in 2008 that the """" two greatest tragedies in our country """" were slavery and abortion.
There are also some off-color remarks. Bush, as G. Morris, live-blogged the Republican convention last CENSOREDfrfrfr there was a protest by naked women.
"""" You know Trump is onto something huge when he causes people to shed their underwear, """" Bush wrote, a few months before the Washington Post released the now-infamous tape from 2005 in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women.
Bush also wrote that, """" The Democrats are trying to win with the same game plan as in 2008, only substitute woman for Black. """"
Bush did not return a request for comment on Friday. The White House and Cruz's office also did not immediately respond to questions about Bush's blogging.
Bush was a Trump supporter, according to his blog posts, although he volunteered for and contributed to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign. ( Paul ended his campaign in February 2016. ) During the Republican convention Bush wrote, """" The decision of who will replace Justice Scalia -- and perhaps others on the high court -- is the top reason why the choice between Trump and Hillary is a no brainier CENSOREDfrfrfr questionnaire that all judicial nominees submit to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is one of five contributors listed on Elephants in the Grass ; his wife, Bridget Bush, also an attorney, is the founder. His pen name, G. Morris, is a likely homage to Gouverneur Morris, a founding father who was involved in drafting the US Constitution. Bush noted in his questionnaire that he had written a historical novel about Morris that he hoped would be published.
Bush has worked at the Louisville, Kentucky-based law firm Bingham Greenebaum Doll since 1996. Before that, he spent six years in Washington, DC, at another law firm, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. While at Gibson Dunn, he was part of a team of lawyers that wrote President Reagan's response to an independent counsel's report about the Iran-Contra affair. He clerked for a federal appeals judge after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1989.
Bush has long been involved in Kentucky politics, and volunteered for Senate Majority Leader Mitch CENSOREDfrfrfr to his questionnaire, Bush expressed his interest in a federal judgeship to McConnell and a member of Paul's staff in late 2016 and early 2017. He said that he was interviewed by lawyers from the White House and the Justice Department in February.
His nomination has already faced some pushback. Shortly after the White House announced the nomination on May 8, the liberal advocacy group Alliance for Justice highlighted remarks that Bush gave in 2009 that appeared to express his disagreement with the US Supreme Court's 1964 opinion New York Times v. Sullivan, which established protections for journalists against certain libel claims.

Wendy Stone/Corbis via Getty Images
The newly-released details of the Trump administration's version of the """" Mexico City policy """" are raising many questions about its impact not only on abortion but also on preventing HIV and infectious diseases like malaria.
The policy is named for the place where it was introduced by President Ronald Reagan, at a U.N. conference, in 1984. The aim was to cut off U.S. funding to nongovernmental organizations that """" perform CENSOREDfrfrfr. """"
President Barack Obama had revoked the rule ( as did President Bill Clinton ). But President Trump has reinstated and renamed it ( the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance plan ). And on Monday, he gave details on its newly expanded scope.
Previously, only federally funded family planning organizations were affected. Now the restrictions apply to any nongovernmental group receiving funds provided by the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Defense. So the plan would apply to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which funds HIV prevention and treatment in nearly 60 countries, and the President's Malaria Initiative.
The amount of U.S. funds now covered are nearly $9 billion compared with $600 million in earlier iterations.
"""" It has a bigger reach than it's ever had before, and many of the organizations that could now be affected have never confronted it before, """" says Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the CENSOREDfrfrfr be felt in communities where one stand-alone clinic addresses a wide span of health needs. The local reproductive health clinic could receive PEPFAR funding for a program to prevent HIV transmission or U.S. funding to provide bed nets to ward off malaria-carrying mosquitoes. If that clinic provides or promotes abortion, then all of those U.S. funds would now be cut.
There are strong reactions to the policy from anti-abortion groups and from supporters of abortion rights.
"""" This is going to result in an increase in the number of unintended pregnancies, in the number of unsafe abortions, in the number of mothers dying, whether from pregnancy-related causes or HIV causes, and also in the number of infant and child deaths, """" says Geeta Rao Gupta, executive director for the United Nations Foundation's 3D Program for Girls &amp; Women, which addresses the needs and rights of women.
Some research has shown that when the Mexico City policy is in force, abortion rates can rise. One study by Stanford University researchers, published CENSOREDfrfrfr, found that abortions in sub-Saharan African countries held steady at about 10 per 100,000 women every year from 1994 to 2000 during the Clinton administration, which did not enforce the policy. President George W. Bush reinstated the Mexico City policy in 2001, and from 2001 to 2008, there were 14.5 abortions per 100,000 women every year.
The study authors note that it's not possible to be completely certain about the reason for the rise. But they theorize that when women lose access to modern contraceptives like birth control pills because the clinics that provided them had shut down because of a loss of funds, some of the women may turn to unsafe abortions. In 2008, 47,000 women died from complications after unsafe abortions, according the World Health Organization.
The Trump version of the rule does allow referrals for abortions in some limited cases, such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and when the mother's physical health is at risk. But many NGOs that want to comply with the new policy will CENSOREDfrfrfr, predicts Brian Dixon, vice president for media and government relations at Population Connection Action Fund. That is what happened during the previous iteration of the rule, Dixon says: """" One of the problems with this policy is the chill it imposes """" on any discussion of abortion.
"""" Children should n't have to pay with their lives for the poverty of their parents, """" says Deirdre McQuade, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. """" Abortion's not the answer, addressing basic needs is. """" She believes funding for proper nutrition and sanitation should be priorities to help mothers in low-income countries take care of their children.
The new rule went into effect earlier this week. Any new U.S. government grant for an NGO health program will need to comply with the rules on abortion restrictions. Groups operating with an existing grant from U.S. government sources wo n't need to comply until their contract is up for renewal or if they apply for additional funding.
It's difficult to assess CENSOREDfrfrfr Health Assistance plan, partly because it's unclear whether other donors like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation ( which is a funder of NPR ) will fill any gaps that occur because of the new policy. It's also not clear how many NGOs will comply with the new policy and how many will refuse to do so. But a Kaiser Family Health Foundation report looking at countries that got U.S. federal funding in 2016 notes that 37 countries allowed abortions in at least one circumstance that would violate the Mexico City policy.
Dixon knows one agency in Kenya that wo n't comply. Family Health Options Kenya runs more than a dozen reproductive health clinics that provide family planning and HIV prevention services. Some of the clinics serve the poorest neighborhoods in Nairobi. Family Health Options Kenya expects to lose about 60 percent of its total funding and is planning to close about half of its clinics to absorb the cuts, according to a fact sheet that the nonprofit prepared this year.
The State Department plans to track CENSOREDfrfrfr of its rollout. For a program like PEPFAR, the goal is to determine whether the new restrictions disrupt HIV prevention and treatment. The State Department is prepared to offer waivers to NGOs in regions with no other providers of HIV services. """" It would have to be a data-driven discussion to really make that case, """" says a senior State Department official familiar with PEPFAR who requested anonymity.
"""" I think that the waiver is an attempt to placate those who are very concerned about this policy, """" says Scott Evertz, former director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy during the Bush administration. He expressed concerns about what metrics would be used to track whether a waiver was necessary and which staffers within the State Department would carry out this evaluation. """" I know there are a lot of smart people in the federal government, but I do n't think that's been thought through at all. """"
"""" I'm proudly pro-life, """" Evertz states. """" I do n't like CENSOREDfrfrfr solution to an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. However, all that said, I have no doubt that this policy will result in the unnecessary deaths from HIV of individuals that were living as a result of the assistance that we were providing. """"

A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the Population Connection Action Fund as the Population Action Fund. Additionally, it incorrectly said 10 per 10,000 women in part of Africa had abortions each year from 1994 to 2000. The rate was 10 per 100,000.

This expansion will have a devastating impact on global health -- particularly for women and families -- as well as on free speech.
The global gag rule stops foreign NGOs from using their own money to provide abortions, information about abortion, or referrals for abortion to women who want them. In addition, it prohibits groups receiving U.S. funding from engaging in legal and political advocacy to promote changes to a country's laws or policies related to abortion. It also bans NGOs from running public education campaigns to provide people with truthful information about abortion.
The president's announcement came just one day after he issued a statement marking the start of Women's Health Week, calling for affordable, accessible, and quality healthcare for women. Yet this policy CENSOREDfrfrfr things worse.
Previous administrations that have imposed the global gag rule have made it a condition of receiving grants from a pool of some $600 million in family planning funding. The Trump administration has drastically expanded the reach of the policy to apply to all global health assistance furnished by the U.S. -- to the tune of $8.8 billion. That means that money intended for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, or for combating malaria and Zika, is now conditioned on compliance with a rule that is inherently devastating to women and families the world over.
When the global gag rule has been imposed in the past, the health consequences have been severe: Clinics that provided reproductive, maternal, and child health care services were shuttered Access to contraception was restricted And the number of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions increased -- factors that lead to more women and children dying.
The expansion of this dangerous policy means that not only will women lose access to critical reproductive health care, counseling, and information, but there will CENSOREDfrfrfr programs. If organizations refuse to stop providing truthful and often life-saving information about abortion that their clients want and need, they may have to shut down critical programs that prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, fight infectious diseases, and improve nutrition, hygiene, and maternal and child health throughout the world. Simply put, it will devastate health care access in some of the world's neediest communities.
Let's be clear: The Trump administration is essentially coercing groups by telling them that if they want to continue to receive aid that their community desperately needs -- to prevent maternal mortality, to stop the spread of malaria, to provide health care for children -- they must give up their right to engage in truthful speech that the U.S. government does n't like.
For the communities that can not afford to lose U.S. health aid, the administration is ensuring the silence of the very experts who can provide a unique perspective on reproductive health and is stopping the free flow of information. The limits on advocacy and public CENSOREDfrfrfr dependent on U.S. global health aid will not hear from the full range of local groups and medical experts on legal and policy debates about abortion. The rule expansion will also make it very difficult or impossible for U.S. groups and individuals to partner with foreign groups to engage in legal advocacy and education, and it will stymie research into abortion-related health outcomes -- thereby hampering the advancement of medical science.
The government should not be able to do to foreign organizations what would be unconstitutional were it imposed on domestic groups, which can not be forced to censor their private speech as a condition of government funding. There is no doubt that with this policy, the administration is not only trying to control the flow of information -- an unworthy goal for the U.S. government and contrary to the values of the First Amendment -- but also threatening the health and lives of women and families across the globe.

( AP ) -- Missouri is asking a federal appellate court to put on hold a judge's order blocking abortion-restricting rules in the state, arguing the judge """" categorically refused even to consider the state's evidence justifying its regulations. """"
The state's challenge Thursday to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs refused to delay enforcing the preliminary injunction he issued last month in favor of Planned Parenthood affiliates with Missouri health centers.
The law requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that clinics meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery restrictions Planned Parenthood protested as """" medically unnecessary. """"
Only one licensed abortion clinic remains in the state a Planned Parenthood center in St. Louis partly as a result of Missouri's restrictions. The organization has said Planned Parenthood health centers in Kansas City, Columbia, Joplin and Springfield would provide abortions if the restrictions were scrapped CENSOREDfrfrfr U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case and that the state has been denying abortion rights """" on a daily basis, in irreparable fashion. """" He added that relief sought by Planned Parenthood """" should be prompt, given the needs of women seeking abortions and the need for available clinics to serve their needs. """"
In his three-page ruling Wednesday, Sachs said abortion-seeking women in central and southwestern Missouri are limited to driving to a distant clinic, trying to abort the fetus themselves or with the help of a non-professional, or have an unwanted birth.
Sachs dismissed the state's insistence that it is protecting abortion patients' health in the litigation, writing that """" the converse is demonstrably true. """"
"""" It is hard to believe that the state defendants would urge desperate women who reject the birthing option to avoid a clinic and seek the safety' of self-abortion or back-alley abortions, but they offer no logic or argument to the contrary, """" Sachs wrote. """" They are asking the courts CENSOREDfrfrfr Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley's office fired back Thursday, pressing to the 8th Circuit that Planned Parenthood, with the """" sweeping """" injunction, intends to offer abortions at sites """" that do not satisfy the state's health-and-safety standards, posing an imminent threat to women's health and safety. """"
"""" The district court refused even to consider this evidence. This was plainly erroneous, """" Thursday's appeal read. By granting the injunction, """" the district court ruled that it could not and would not consider the state's evidence. """"
Planned Parenthood has said that 1.2 million women of reproductive age live in Missouri. The agency's Kansas City center has offered medication-induced abortions and has said it would resume doing so if Missouri regulations in question were deemed unconstitutional.
Its Columbia center stopped offering the procedure a nonsurgical type, induced with a pill in 2015 after its only doctor performing medication-induced abortions lost needed privileges with University of Missouri Health Care.
Spokespeople for the regional Planned Parenthood affiliates told CENSOREDfrfrfr for licenses for their clinics in Kansas City and Columbia. They're hoping to offer abortion services there by this summer and are preparing to submit related applications to the state for the Joplin and Springfield sites. """

Bernie Sanders stumped Saturday for Democrat Rob Quist, who seeks to wrest Montana's only congressional seat from Republican control.
"""" I do n't want to make you nervous, but the eyes of this country are on Montana this week, """" Sanders told an estimated 3,500 people gathered inside the University of Montana's Adams Center in Missoula.
"""" If you can do it in Montana, we can do it all across this country, """" Sanders said. """" We can create a political revolution that restores power to the working class, not just the billionaire class. That's what this campaign is about. """"
The Montana seat became open after President Donald Trump named former-Rep. Ryan Zinke to head the Department of Interior. Quist's main opponent is Republican Greg Gianforte, a Bozeman engineer and entrepreneur who in 2011 sold his software company CENSOREDfrfrfr: Absentee ballots were mailed April 28, and voting ends Thursday.
Quist, a longtime Montana musician and poet, said he's visited 49 of Montana's 56 counties in the past few months. When he first began campaigning, he said, the No. 1 issue he heard raised was access to public lands. But in recent weeks, the focus has shifted to health care.
Both Sanders and Quist decried the House's recent passage of the American Health Care Act, saying it will boot 24 million people off insurance, 70,000 of them in Montana.
Calling the American Health Care Act """" disastrous, """" and """" one of the ugliest, most dangerous, most un-American """" bills ever passed in Congress, Sanders said he and Quist would work together to create a Medicare for all, single-payer health care system to ensure universal coverage.
"""" Now is the time to make sure we have an economy that works for all of us. Now is the time to make sure we CENSOREDfrfrfr us, """" Sanders said.
"""" Now is not the time to give up. Now is the time to fight back. """"
"""" It's about the fact that everybody's important. Everybody deserves to have a shot at everything, """" said Abby Lucarz, 49, of Missoula. Lucarz and her two children, Dorothy Rose, 20, and Ryder, 16, were first in line outside the Adams Center at 5 a.m. Saturday.
By the time the doors opened at 10 a.m., about 500 people had joined the line, some sporting T-shirts that read: """" Proud to be a Democrat, """" """" We Should All Be Feminists, """" and """" Resist, """" with a picture of Smokey the Bear holding up a fist in protest.
Volunteers for the Quist campaign worked the line to determine whether people had voted. After the event, buses arrived to transport people to an election center for voting. Other volunteers went canvassing in Missoula neighborhoods.
Many people CENSOREDfrfrfr the famed Montana bluegrass band, the Mission Mountain Wood Band ( M2WB ). They shared memories of the University of Montana's Aber Day Keggers in the early 1970s, when the band played with the likes of Bonnie Raitt, Earl Scruggs and Jimmy Buffett.
Originally from Cut Bank, Montana, the 69-year-old Quist hails from a ranching family and currently lives on a ranch in the Flathead Valley with his wife, Bonni. They have two grown children, Halladay and Guthrie, also musicians, who performed with their band to warm up the crowd Saturday.
"""" I've known him since I was 14, """" Kalispell resident Beth Robinson said of Quist. Robinson's brother, Terry, was another of the Mission Mountain Wood Band's original members. Quist, she said, is """" genuine, kind to a fault, positive, uplifting. """"
Andy Hill of Missoula remembered a night years ago when Quist played a benefit concert for Hill's father, who had serious health care issues CENSOREDfrfrfr issues of his own at the time, but rested all day, performed at the concert, then went back to bed, Hill said.
Quist said this election is """" a fight for the soul of Montana. """" Wealthy outsiders look upon the state's beautiful rivers, mountains and valleys and think, """" That'd be good to own, """" he said.
"""" Real Montanans, """" however, see that as an attack on their way of life, he said. The transfer of public lands to private ownership, he said, is """" nothing more than theft against our children and grandchildren. """"

Greg Gianforte
HELENA -- In an eight-and-a-half minute YouTube video titled """" Why does the Montana Family Foundation Exist? """" a collection of people lay out the things that keep them up at night:
The sanctity of marriage under threat. Children at risk of growing up in homes without both biological parents. A lack of school choice and alternatives to public education.
Foundation president and CEO Jeff Laszloffy appears at the end, telling viewers """" it's time for us to rise up as a people """" and join with the group. He lists three ways to help -- volunteer, pray and commit financial resources.
"""" This is an expensive battle, """" he said. """" We're not just here to play. We're in this game to win, but to do that we need everyone's help CENSOREDfrfrfr have put dollars into that battle include the charitable trust run by Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate for Montana's empty U.S. House seat, and his wife Susan. Since at least 2004, the Gianforte Family Foundation has given nearly $900,000 to the foundation, in some years making up nearly half of the money the foundation brings in from gifts, grants, contributions and membership fees.
The Montana Family Foundation is actually an umbrella name for two groups -- one also called the Montana Family Foundation and the other called the Montana Family Institute. Work is focused on four areas: life, marriage and family, religious freedom and school choice.
The Montana Family Foundation groups have a linked, two-prong approach. The Institute cultivates an interest in conservative issues and keeps the risks of a progressive agenda at the forefront of people's minds. The Foundation then taps into that primed voter pool by telling them who will save Montana from those fears. The Institute creates a sense of urgency and the Foundation offers a CENSOREDfrfrfr the sub-Foundation is a 501(c) ( 4 ), sometimes called a social welfare organization, that can engage in some political activity, and has done so aggressively, if sporadically, according to records filed with the state's campaign finance watchdog. The Institute is a 501(c) ( 3 ), which can not spend money directly with campaigns or on electioneering activity.
To be clear, the Gianforte Family Foundation only gives to the Institute. Still, the portion they support can do things like produce a scorecard of how legislators vote on family issues and ranks candidates based on their stance on religious freedom, abortion and other issues of that nature, according to Montana Family Foundation communications director Bowen Greenwood. And even though the Gianforte-funded arm is banned from direct political communications, Susan Gianforte would have had input on the direction of the political segment when she served on the board of the overall organization until February 2014.
Neither the Institute or Foundation's lists of donors is public, so it's hard to say CENSOREDfrfrfr Gianforte trust, but both groups' available tax records show the contributions are significant.
In 2012, for example, the Gianforte trust's grants made up 60 percent of the Institute's money that came from gifts, grants, contributions and membership fees. Filings from 2010 to 2014 show Gianforte trust money making up 11 percent in 2010, 32 percent in 2011, 54 percent in 2013 and 29 percent in 2014.
That money helps fund the Institute's public education work in the religious community.
"""" We're keeping them educated about what's going on with the Legislature. We do a lot of civic education work with that community about elections that are coming up, how to vote, how to participate, """" Greenwood said. <h> Montana Legislature
According to radio programs recorded by Laszloffy, who was traveling and not available for an interview for this story, the Legislature is something to monitor closely for danger.
In a broadcast a week after the end of the 2017 session CENSOREDfrfrfr the state: """" Sleep well, Montana, you're safe for another two years. """"
In a program the week before, Laszloffy discussed a bill called the Montana Locker Room Privacy Act. In the foundation's eyes, the failed legislation would have protected vulnerable young women from men seeking to enter locker rooms and bathrooms to take advantage of them. To those who defeated it, the bill was discriminatory against those who are transgender.
The bill was killed by """" four misguided Republicans, """" Laszloffy told listeners, illustrating the group's comfort with singling out Republicans it feels are not conservative enough.
That Republican-on-Republican criticism in the name of creating a more conservative party has been the focus of the political segment of the group. Republican Representative Rob Cook, from Conrad, was a target of those efforts in 2014 and still has the fliers to prove it.
Cook, a self-identified """" responsible Republican """" who has crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats on some major legislation in the CENSOREDfrfrfr fair negotiator, first came into the crosshairs of the foundation in 2011 after he voted against a bill to require a woman to have an ultrasound before an abortion. In 2013, he voted against a bill that would have required a school district to get written consent before teaching students sex ed.
"""" Hell, I'm not pro-abortion either but they had an ultrasound bill where you basically had to get raped by an ultrasound if you wanted to have an abortion, """" Cook said. """" It was a bunch of stuff like that. """"
So it was no surprise when the fliers showed up in 2014 during his primary against Ann Morren.
The politically capable Foundation side spent an estimated $5,600 to send fliers showing Cook's sinister-looking black-and-white mugshot next to a bright color photo of a child looking terrified.
In that primary, Greg and Susan Gianforte also each gave $170, the maximum allowed in 2014, to Morren.
In total, the Montana Family Foundation reported spending $52,350 in CENSOREDfrfrfr expenditures went to fliers opposing Republican Sen. Duane Ankney. In the previous session, Ankney was a vocal proponent of a bill that decriminalized homosexual sex and spoke personally about his gay daughter.
The group's success in 2014 was tempered -- just four of 10 of their candidates advanced. But two years prior, they saw major victories, spending $320,000 in the 2012 election. The bulk of that, about $243,000, went to support a successful ballot initiative to require parental consent for women under the age of 16 before an abortion. The rest went toward postcards aimed at either attacking less conservative candidates or supporting those that aligned with the group's mission. <h> Conservative identity
When asked last week why the Gianforte Charitable Trust has supported the Institute side of the operation, Gianforte said the group's mission aligns with his views.
"""" I am a conservative. And I believe that conservative views in government lead to increased prosperity. Conservative views support lower taxes, less regulation, letting people keep the CENSOREDfrfrfr
Asked last fall about his trust's donations, Gianforte emphasized the money could not be used politically.
"""" Not one of these organizations can use a dime of what we've given them for political purposes This is money that's been given for the purpose of helping the vulnerable, increasing educational opportunities, ministerial purposes. None of it is used for political purposes. If it was, they'd lose their nonprofit status and the ( Gianforte ) foundation would lose its nonprofit status. It's not a line that gets crossed. """"
Campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon said last week Gianforte will defend First Amendment rights, which includes religious liberty.
"""" He'll protect anyone's right to believe and practice whatever they want. That's what's in the First Amendment of our Constitution. That's the very first freedom. He opposes any effort by the federal government to impose religious beliefs or prevent the ability of Montanans to practice their faith, """" Scanlon said. """" You ca n't have CENSOREDfrfrfr set of religious beliefs. """"
Gianforte's """" faith does compel him to serve and give back and show compassion for others, """" Scanlon said. """" He's supported a wide variety of causes because he wants to help others. """"
Greenwood said by his assessment the Montana Family Foundation had not scaled up its political activity because of the involvement of the Gianfortes. He said activity is more dictated by changing finance laws and the need to comply with them.
Gianforte also said the trust tends to """" support organizations we're directly involved in. It's the reason why we've been so supportive of Petra Academy and why we've gotten so involved in the manufacturing scholarships and the ACE Scholarships. """" <h> Education
The nexus of a private religious school Gianforte founded in Bozeman called Petra Academy and the Gianforte-funded ACE Scholarship program, which helped 520 students attend private and religious schools in its first year in 2013, shows a desire to privatize schools that concerns the president of Montana's largest CENSOREDfrfrfr privatization bill, whether it's pay vouchers, charter schools or income tax credits, has been advocated for or lobbied for by the Montana Family Foundation, """" said Eric Feaver, head of the union that includes public school employees.
On education issues, MFF has been very aggressive in their """" pursuit of privatization """" and helping get people elected who further that agenda, Feaver said.
Feaver and Laszloffy have squared off against each other in Helena for years, but early on the group focused more on issues involving advocating for a conservative Christian lifestyle, Feaver said.
"""" When Greg Gianforte started investing money, that was when they started ramping up their school choice agenda, """" Feaver said. <h> Influencing the Legislature
Cook said that amount of money the Montana Family Foundation and Institute have access to gives the small group -- the Institute lists 151 volunteers on its 2015 tax forms -- an outsized influence that has led to a Legislature that is more conservative than the state as a whole. CENSOREDfrfrfr follow their viewpoint even though those same views are not indicative of Montana's underlying demographic, """" Cook said. """" They've done an extraordinary job of overrunning the Legislature """" with more conservative candidates.
Even though the Gianforte trust does not give to the political arm, the money it contributes can help rally potential candidates around conservative issues and create interest in running for seats.
"""" When you're recruiting from a natural cadre of zealots it's a lot easier, """" Cook said. """" They are disproportionately represented among the Montana Legislature, and it's Gianforte's money that's responsible for it. """"
The Institute, as a part of its work, produces a scorecard of how legislators have voted on family-oriented issues. It uses that information to rank candidates on how they stand on issues like religious freedom and abortion.
"""" The foundation likes to do our best to help Christians and people of faith know how pro-family the candidate is. It was founded for the primary purpose to CENSOREDfrfrfr is affecting them and also provide information to policy makers about the desires and hopes of people of faith, """" Greenwood said.
The Montana Family Foundation formed in 2004, after the Montana Family Coalition dissolved. It joined the national movement to capture the previously untapped religious right and focus it into a political base, the religious right. And in Montana through the work of the Montana Family Foundation's educational arm, with funding from the Gianforte charitable trust, it has trained its base to view political campaigning as a significant part of their religious expression.
"""" Jeff and the crew of folks that started the Montana Family Foundation mirrored that same attempt to create an identity that was part of the religious right that was using this national framework to build political power, """" said Rachel Carol Rivas, co-director of the Montana Human Rights Network.
In 2016 the Montana Family Foundation did n't report any spending on the election. That's because of changes from the Disclose Act, a sweeping revision of Montana CENSOREDfrfrfr opposed by the foundation.
Gianforte has called the law a """" work in progress. """" Democrats have tried to paint him as opposed to it because the lead attorney in a lawsuit challenging the Disclose Act is was also his campaign attorney during the governor's race.
Under the act, nonprofits have to identify contributors who paid for any messages that mention a candidate or a race. """" The Disclose Act resulted in a massive change in how we do business, """" Greenwood said. """

On a recent Sunday afternoon, dozens of volunteers crammed into a small Jon Ossoff for Congress field office in Chamblee, Ga. They were there to canvass for the 30-year-old political newcomer, but they also got a treat: a speech from Ossoff himself. He only spoke for about four minutes, but he devoted almost a minute of it to women in particular.
"""" It's got nothing to do with me, """" he said. """" I keep saying it's got everything to do with this community and what we can achieve when we work together and so much of it CENSOREDfrfrfr women in this community who have been organizing and active who recognize that we ca n't -- we ca n't go back in time. """"
In several ways, this closely watched special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District is a microcosm of national gender politics right now. Many liberal women see themselves as fueling what they call the """" resistance """" to President Trump and the Republican agenda, and they paint the GOP as a political force with a decidedly anti-woman agenda. The Republican side fights against that """" war on women """" messaging, and many women furthermore resent the idea that they'd ever let gender be a factor in their political lives. And on both sides, abortion and Planned Parenthood loom large.
Ossoff knows women have played an important role in his success thus far. After garnering the most votes in the April primary, Ossoff thanked women in particular for """" stepping up and organizing. """" He told NPR that he believes women are leading a """" renaissance of civic engagement and activism CENSOREDfrfrfr are now trying to push him to a win in the June runoff vote -- polls show that he's running neck-and-neck with Republican Karen Handel in a district that has had Republican representatives since 1979.
"""" I think he recognized that the army behind him were women activists and he's been incredibly grateful for that activism and energy, and I think he is the real deal, """" said Jen Cox, co-founder of Pave it Blue, a Georgia-based organization of women who want to elect left-leaning politicians.
She said her organization gives women who might be new to political activism the opportunity to ease into it -- marching up to someone with a clipboard and asking about their voting patterns can be intimidating. So she tells people to use whatever skills they have -- to make food for fellow volunteers or research candidates' positions, for example.
But it's not just about hard skills. Pave it Blue member Jenny Peterson uses her role as mother to reach out to potential Ossoff supporters. While canvassing CENSOREDfrfrfr with a son with strep throat.
"""" We were thinking for our precinct we might try to organize a playdate for East Cobb Park, """" Peterson offered. """" Just kind of a day that we invite our voters in the precinct to bring your kids. """"
Making these local connections is a big part of this kind of organizing, Peterson explained, as she climbed a hill to a large suburban house with her fellow canvasser, Elizabeth Murphy, 35.
"""" We're getting people to know our names and faces, because we'll be the people sitting in the camp chairs at their voting place at that park, that's where they vote, """" Peterson said, explaining that they did that during the April primary vote. """" Liz and I set up there... with camp chairs and signs, and we just waved to people as they came by. """"
Gender, of course, is only one of many powerful forces driving this election. The simple fact that this CENSOREDfrfrfr -- in a time when liberals are itching for meaningful ways to show their opposition to Trump's GOP -- plus the prospect of winning in a red-leaning district, has helped this race attract celebrity endorsements, outside money and national attention.
But women like Peterson, Murphy and Pave it Blue co-founder Cox have taken their roles to heart as being a part of that """" army """" that Cox described. And while Cox is quick to say that her group does n't want to discount men's contributions, she explains that for many women, a women-only forum is the best place to have conversations about things like reproductive rights.
"""" We're having pretty intimate discussions about what matters to us and what we're comfortable doing, """" Cox explained. """" And we have a common thread of,' Our rights are at stake.' And when you invite men into a conversation that we feel should be protected, that dynamic can change. """"
One more benefit that these women see in women-focused CENSOREDfrfrfr blocks, Murphy and Peterson climbed into Peterson's minivan, which bore a bumper sticker for a local group called the Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb. The sticker's slogan: You are not alone.
"""" When I first moved here I was like, oh, my god, I am the only one, you know? """" Murphy said, explaining the sticker. """" And it makes you want to be quiet. And it, like, gives you this false sense that you should hide, and you should be closeted. """"
That's because conservatism is deeply embedded in this district. And attitudes toward gender and politics can be starkly different between women in either party. On the Republican side, some women resent the idea that gender would have anything to do with voting for Handel. Johsira Ezammudeen, for example, responded to the way that Ossoff calls out women as the driving force behind his campaign.
"""" You know, so, he can talk a lot about CENSOREDfrfrfr as a woman. I am here as a citizen -- American citizen, """" she said. """" When you start dividing the citizens by group like woman and then this group and then this group, you are dividing the whole nation. We are not here to divide. We're here to unify and elect somebody who's going to do what we citizens want. """"

Ezammudeen was at the grand opening of Handel's Cobb County field office, where Handel smiled for photos with constituents while volunteers passed cake around. Even connecting gender to politics is anathema to Ezammudeen's friend, Rommys Beltran. She scoffs at CENSOREDfrfrfr
"""" We have to make a smart decision, and that's the problem that we have with the Democrats, """" Beltran said. """" They do n't make smart decisions and make decisions based on hair color or stupid things like that. No, we really think about what they're saying. """"
Karen Handel's gender has come into play in her political career. Her own reproductive health came into her 2010 campaign for governor. Georgia Right to Life refused to endorse Handel -- part of that was because of her approval of abortion in cases of rape and incest, but part was also about fertility treatments. Handel and her husband had tried various options, unsuccessfully, in attempting to have a child. Georgia Right to Life's Steve Becker commented on those types of treatments:
"""" Someone's desperate right to parenthood -- because they're infertile, they're barren, whatever term you want to use -- is an emotionally fraught subject that has our highest sympathy, """" he said in CENSOREDfrfrfr be addressed where a life is taken in the process. """"
Handel has said she was stung by his usage of the words """" desperate """" and """" barren, """" and she called on Becker to resign, as the Atlanta Journal Constitution later reported.
That was her first high-profile tangle over abortion, but Handel is far better-known for her brief time at the Komen Foundation, a national breast-cancer prevention organization.
She landed in the middle of a national controversy in 2012 as a vice president at Komen. She pushed to end the group's funding to Planned Parenthood, which provides breast exams. That effort sparked an outcry, and Handel resigned. At the time, some predicted that Komen's brand would suffer long-term damage, and donations to Komen fell afterward.
It's not something she talks about much in this campaign. And when NPR made multiple requests for an interview, her campaign said she was unavailable.
But her history of opposing abortion has made her a hero to CENSOREDfrfrfr Republican Women.
"""" Women can get health issues taken care of other places than Planned Parenthood, """" Watson said. """" Planned Parenthood is an abortion mill. """"
Handel's latest ad touches on this topic, but it's the lightest of touches. In it, a friend of Handel's -- a cancer patient named Anne -- tells the camera, """" When I see ads attacking Karen Handel they make me sick. Karen is one of the strongest advocates for women's health I know. """" She goes on to tell people to """" ignore the attacks """" on Handel.
It's an ad that will bring the Komen controversy to mind for many voters, even if it's not trying to change anybody's mind about it. But to those voters who do n't know about the Handel-Komen connection, it signals that Ossoff is unfairly attacking Handel on the amorphous, broad topic of women's health.
Perhaps the stronghold of this district's conservatism is the northern part, farther CENSOREDfrfrfr support in the April primary. In Mugs on Milton, a picturesque coffee shop in that northern area, moms filter in around 9:30 a.m. on weekdays after dropping off kids at local schools.
One of those moms is Joy Derrer, who home-schools her six kids. ( Derrer told NPR a local school caters to home-school families by bringing the kids in one day a week, allowing her to spend some time at the coffee shop. )
Derrer said that she's pro-life, but that that's not the only thing she likes about Handel.
"""" I like that she's conservative and that she upholds the standards that are, to me, true to what has made America great, """" Derrer said.
Ansley Schoen, a 20-year-old student at nearby Florida State University, likewise appreciates Handel's conservative politics, but she is one Republican woman for whom Handel's gender matters.
"""" I'm personally a woman trying to go into politics, """" she said, in between calls CENSOREDfrfrfr, there are n't as many women Republicans up in Congress, and so it'd be great to have Karen Handel for that. """" """
18569891,1192,17-05-22,US,Gallup,http://www.gallup.com/poll/210917/views-moral-values-slip-seven-year-lows.aspx?g_source=POLITICS&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles,Views of US Moral Values Slip to Seven-Year Lows,"by Jim Norman <h> Story Highlights
81% say state of moral values is """" only fair """" or """" poor """"
77% say the state of moral values is getting worse
Views have been consistently negative, at least since 2002
WASHINGTON, D.C -- Americans' ratings of U.S. moral values, consistently negative through the years, have slipped to their lowest point in seven years. More than four in five ( 81% ) now rate the state of moral values in the U.S. as only fair or poor.
Since Gallup first asked in 2002 whether the nation's moral values were getting better or getting worse, the percentage saying worse has always been well above the majority level, ranging from a low of 64% in November 2004 to a high of 82% in May 2007. Over the past six years, it has stayed within a five-point range, reaching a low of 72% in 2013 and 2015 before climbing to this CENSOREDfrfrfr about the current state of moral values getting better or worse has been asked over the same 16-year span as the question about the overall state of moral values. The combined percentage saying moral values are only fair or poor through the years has generally aligned with views about moral values getting worse.
The percentage of those having a positive view of the country's moral values -- either excellent or good -- peaked at 26% in November 2004, the same time that a high of 27% of people said the state of moral values was getting better. The individual highs that year were 4% excellent and 22% good.
Americans' low regard for their nation's moral values was evident in questions extending back well before the current questions were first asked 16 years ago. In 1991, 63% of U.S. adults said they were dissatisfied with the ethics and moral standards of the American people. In a 1996 poll, 39% said the state of moral values in the country today was somewhat weak, and 39% said it CENSOREDfrfrfr but Liberals' Ratings Also Low
Americans who define their views on social issues as liberal have seen their ranks grow from 21% in 1999 to 30% this year, reflecting the movement of the public toward acceptance of liberal positions on several moral values-related issues. Americans now support liberal views in record numbers on 10 different social issues.
With public opinion on those issues moving in a liberal direction, and with major Supreme Court rulings in recent years supporting abortion rights and gay marriage, social conservatives have always been more likely than liberals to say the state of moral values is poor and more likely to say it is getting worse. But even among liberals, in no year have more than a third described moral values as excellent or good, and only in 2009 -- a few months after Barack Obama's first presidential inauguration -- did less than a majority say it was getting worse.
The percentage of social liberals who thought moral values were getting worse stayed below 60% for most of Obama's presidency but CENSOREDfrfrfr inauguration. The change from a Democratic White House to a Republican one also contributed to a substantial drop in pessimism among social conservatives. Seventy-seven percent -- an 11-percentage-point drop from last year -- now say moral values are getting worse.
With the percentage of moderates saying moral values are getting worse now up to 86%, 2017 is the first year social conservatives are not the group most likely to think values are worsening.
Attitudes Differ Widely by Age, Locale
No majority of any major demographic group views the state of moral values as good or excellent, but opinions differ significantly when looking at those who rate the state of the nation's values as poor. The overall average for the 16 years that Gallup has been asking the question is 42% saying poor, but that rises above 50% among a few groups and drops to a third or less among others:
Major differences occur by age. About half ( 51% ) of those aged 65 and older believe moral values are in a poor state CENSOREDfrfrfr
Fifty-four percent of those who live in a rural area, compared with 33% of those living a big city, say moral values are poor.
Thirty-one percent of those with postgraduate work say the country's moral values are poor.
Bottom Line
Though majorities of Americans say they are proud of their country and are satisfied with their overall quality of life, they are not as positive about the state of the nation's moral values. Even liberals, who seemingly should be pleased with the growing number of Americans who agree with their point of view on the morality of prominent social issues, are more likely to say things are getting worse than getting better.
Two possible reasons for the negativity among liberals in general and the rise in negativity this year among both moderates and liberals:
While social conservatives look at the decline in marriages, the increase in children born outside of marriage and the growing number of Americans identifying as nonreligious, social liberals have no lack of moral issues that concern CENSOREDfrfrfr in the nation and the nation's efforts to deal with poverty and homelessness. Further, Trump's emergence has brought forth a barrage of articles from liberal publications about the coarsening of moral values.
Americans are not necessarily thinking about moral values in terms of abortion, gay marriage or other social issues that produce legislation and Supreme Court rulings. Polls in 2010and 2012that asked respondents to cite the most important problem with moral values found that the reason most often cited was lack of respect or tolerance for others, with poor parenting also frequently mentioned.
With both conservatives and liberals criticizing the other side for lack of respect and with Americans of all backgrounds able to find some moral issue to deplore, there seems to be little chance of a substantive change in the near future to the longstanding trend of Americans having overwhelmingly negative views about the state of moral values. <h> Survey Methods
Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted May 3-7, 2017, with a random sample of 1,011 adults CENSOREDfrfrfr U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is? 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.
Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70% cellphone respondents and 30% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.
White Americans became less racially resentful during the Obama years compared with the years before he took office. This change was evident among independents and Democrats, but not among Republicans. """

Rep. Dan Huberty, the House education chairman, said he's not agreeing with this version of HB 21.
The Texas Senate early Monday approved a bill, 21-10, that would inject about $530 million into the public education system while creating a so-called school choice system that would redirect state money to help special education students pay for private school tuition.
The bill, however, faces an uncertain fate -- the Senate has made it clear that House Bill 21 dies if school choice is n't included in the bill, while the House has said the bill dies if school choice is included.
"""" It is hard for me to believe any Texas lawmaker would vote against a half-billion dollars for public schools, as well as voting against children with disabilities, simply to oppose school choice, """" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement.
CENSOREDfrfrfr into the public school system through updating and adding various elements to the school funding formula. However, the Senate has reduced the extra funding to about half a billion dollars, which would pay for:
* A $150 million hardship grant for about 150 school districts that will lose so-called Additional State Aid for Tax Reduction funding in September.
* More funding for school district construction and the establishment of such funding for the first time for charter schools.
* Funding for schools to educate students with dyslexia.
* A $20 million grant program for public schools to educate students with autism in third grade and lower.
* A state commission to study and make recommendations on how to improve the school finance system.
The Austin school district would not receive any extra funding from HB 21 ; Round Rock would receive about $3 million over the next two years ; and Pflugerville would receive about $800,000 over the next two years. Those school districts would have received millions more under a previous version of CENSOREDfrfrfr a bunch of different needs on one bill, """" said Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, who presented the new version of HB 21 late Sunday. """" We put one little thing on the end of it called ( education savings accounts ), the whole world is coming to an end. """"
Arguably the most contentious part of the bill to some, including teacher groups and school district officials, is a provision that would create a school choice system called education savings accounts for special education students. Under the savings account system, $8,200 of per-student funding the school district receives would be diverted to an account that a special education student leaving public school could use on private school tuition or other nonpublic education expenses. Critics have said the savings accounts are just another name for private school vouchers, which would take money from cash-strapped public schools.
Last month, during a marathon debate of the House's version of the state budget, House members overwhelmingly approved an amendment barring any state money from supporting school CENSOREDfrfrfr's stance on the issue.
Rep. Dan Huberty, R-Houston, who is the original author of the bill and House education chairman, told the American-Statesman on Monday that he does n't plan on agreeing with the version of HB 21 passed earlier that day, which means the chambers' differences likely will have to be sussed out in a committee.
Huberty added that HB 21 is n't funded in the Senate's version of the budget.
"""" I'm meeting with my staff today, and we're going to go look at it and we're going to decide if there's any options. I do n't think there are, """" Huberty said.
Taylor also removed from Huberty's version of the bill a funding bump to educate non-native English speakers and scrapped an increase to the $5,140 per-student allotment that all public schools receive. Taylor said the changes were meant to bring down the cost of the bill. <h> About the Author

A set of US laws which claim to promote maternal and infant health are in fact driving pregnant women away from vital health services, jeopardizing their wellbeing and violating their right to health, according to a new report published by Amnesty International today.
These laws put pregnant women in a double bind, forcing them to choose between risking their health and risking punishment
Criminalizing Pregnancy: Policing Pregnant Women Who Use Drugs in the USA, highlights the impact of pregnancy criminalization laws, especially those which are used to arrest and prosecute women who use drugs based on a belief that they are harming their fetuses. Fear of these laws is deterring pregnant women from accessing healthcare, prenatal care and even drug treatment.
"""" Across the USA, the heavy-handed policing of pregnant women's behaviour is shattering patient trust in health services with devastating consequences. These laws put pregnant women in a double bind, CENSOREDfrfrfr punishment, """" said Carrie Eisert, Policy Adviser at Amnesty International, who authored the report.
"""" Drug dependence is a health condition but US authorities are treating it as a crime, failing to ensure treatment is available for pregnant women and then punishing them for their ongoing condition. These harsh and discriminatory laws are making pregnancy more dangerous and trampling on human rights in the process. """" <h> An ongoing assault
The report pays particular attention to the impact of the' chemical endangerment' law in Alabama, the state that has carried out the most prosecutions against pregnant women ; and Tennessee's' fetal assault' law, which between 2014 and 2016 made it a crime to give birth to a child showing symptoms of drug exposure.
However, most states have some sort of' fetal assault' law in place, and the trend is growing. In the 2017 legislative session, states introduced more than 300 measures to restrict sexual and reproductive rights, emblematic of a dangerous and ongoing assault on CENSOREDfrfrfr days of the Trump administration.
One woman told Amnesty International how she was charged under Alabama's' chemical endangerment' law upon suspicion of using drugs, despite being unaware she was pregnant. Another described how the threat of punishment had deterred her from seeking healthcare:
"""" In my town, I was worried about going to the doctor because if you test positive for drugs, bam, you're slapped with a' chemical endangerment' charge. """"
In Tennessee, one woman told Amnesty International how she had given birth on the side of the road trying to avoid going to a hospital, where she feared prosecution under the' fetal assault' law.
Although the' fetal assault' law in Tennessee ended in 2016, it is still in the state code and is likely to be introduced again.
The same woman described how she subsequently spent months trying to find drug dependence treatment, but was unable to find any available services that would accept her insurance. Treatment costs are CENSOREDfrfrfr International has highlighted how this narrow focus on punishment, in the absence of increased funding or provisions to expand drug treatment services, means these laws are failing in their stated aim of promoting healthy pregnancies. They are also violating women's rights to health, privacy, equality and non-discrimination. <h> Punishing the poor
The report found stark evidence of discrimination in the implementation of pregnancy criminalization laws, which tend to be disproportionately enforced against low-income women and women of colour.
The vast majority of women charged under the Alabama and Tennessee laws are unable to afford lawyers to represent them, and have been targeted because they are poor.
These women are often already facing multiple levels of discrimination and do not have the resources to navigate the court system or child protection services.
For this reason, women who have historically faced discrimination are at heightened risk of prosecution when they become pregnant. Drug testing is applied selectively, often based on discretionary """" risk """" factors such as low income. Some doctors admitted CENSOREDfrfrfr their own biases.
In some alarming cases drug tests were carried out without women's knowledge, representing a breach of the right to privacy. The director of a community corrections program in Alabama, described the lack of clear protocol on obtaining informed consent:
"""" All hospitals have different rules. A lot of it is random. It's not a real system. We're kind of random here. """"
"""" The vast majority of women charged under the Alabama and Tennessee laws are unable to afford lawyers to represent them, and have been targeted because they are poor. Laws like these are reinforcing stereotypes of low-income and marginalized women, effectively punishing them for their life circumstances, """" said Carrie Eisert.
Although the report focuses on women who have been punished for drug use, the promotion of punitive approaches over women's health and rights has also led to women being prosecuted for refusing medical intervention or even for attempting suicide.
"""" Women's sexual and reproductive rights continue to be CENSOREDfrfrfr look at the evidence and repeal or amend laws used to punish women for their actions during pregnancy -- they are not working, """" said Carrie Eisert.
"""" Criminal justice has no place in public health. Instead of policing women's bodies, authoritiesshould be ensuring pregnant women have access to the prenatal healthcare and drug treatment programs they are entitled to. """"
Background
In April 2014, Tennessee amended its' fetal assault law,' becoming the first state to introduce a criminal law explicitly making it a crime to give birth to a child showing symptoms of prenatal exposure to narcotics. Amnesty International researched the impacts of this law during the two years in which it was in effect.
Alabama's' chemical endangerment' law was passed in 2006 as a means to protect children from environments where they could be exposed to drugs or controlled substances. Individual prosecutors and the Alabama Supreme Court have interpreted the law to apply to pregnant women who use drugs. """

Here are three of the biggest cuts it proposes. ( Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post )
President Trump's 2018 budget request, delivered to Congress on Tuesday with the title """" A New Foundation for American Greatness, """" has roiled the medical and science community with a call for massive cuts in spending on scientific research, medical research, disease prevention programs and health insurance for children of the working poor.
The National Cancer Institute would be hit with a $1 billion cut compared to its 2017 budget. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute would see a $575 million cut, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would see a reduction of $838 million. The administration would cut the overall National Institutes of Health budget from $31.8 billion to $26 billion.
The National Science Foundation, which dispenses grants to a variety of scientific research endeavors, would be trimmed $776 million, an 11 percent cut. NSF had not CENSOREDfrfrfr the so-called """" skinny budget, """" which was released in March.
"""" The National Science Foundation last year used your taxpayer money to fund a climate change musical. Do you think that's a waste of your money? """" asked the director of Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, during a White House briefing on Tuesday.
He also noted the cuts to climate change research, saying that, under President Barack Obama, the """" pendulum went too far to one side """" and the government spent too much on climate science.
"""" Does it mean that we are anti-science? Absolutely not, """" he said. """" We are simply trying to get things back in order to where we can look at the folks who pay the taxes and say,' Look, yeah, we want to do some climate science. But we're not going to do some of the crazy stuff the previous administration did.' """"
The proposed cuts to the U.S. Centers for Disease CENSOREDfrfrfr CDC director Tom Frieden, who went on Twitter to describe the administration's CDC request as """" unsafe at any level of enactment. Would increase illness, death, risks to Americans, and health care costs. """"
In a separate tweet, Frieden listed what he sees as the dire ramifications of the Trump proposal, saying, for starters, that it """" Devastates programs that protect Americans from cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and other deadly and expensive conditions. """"
Steven Houser, president of the American Heart Association, called Trump's budget """" devastating """" and """" unconscionable. """" He urged Congress to boost funding for NIH by $2 billion rather than cut it by nearly $6 billion.
Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said a preliminary analysis indicates that the Trump budget would cut about 17 percent from the overall federal research effort. Holt, a physicist and former Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said cuts to research would have long-term economic CENSOREDfrfrfr somehow growth will magically occur, and yet it cuts the principal source of that growth, """" Holt said. The proposal """" savages research. Economists are clear: That's where we ultimately get our economic growth. """"
The Trump administration is expected to introduce its 2018 budget proposal on May 23, which will likely include major cuts to programs for low-income Americans. ( Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post )
In a conference call with reporters organized by AAAS, retired aerospace executive Norman Augustine said the proposed cuts would be drive many young people out of the fields of science and technology: """" We're likely to lose a whole generation of researchers. """"
Mary Woolley, president of the advocacy group Research! America, noted that Trump's budget spends more money on the military, and said, """" We all want a nation worth defending after all. A healthy and a prosperous nation. The president's budget would not get us there. """"
Slashing programs that normally have enjoyed bipartisan support CENSOREDfrfrfr trillions of dollars in spending over the next decade while at the same time paying for tax cuts and increases in military spending.
Congress has the power of the purse and could essentially ignore the more detailed budget request. Early reactions on both sides of the aisle have been generally unfavorable. One Republican lawmaker, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, flinched at the thought of cutting NIH and such programs as Meals on Wheels. Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ), head of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, sounded queasy about cuts to Meals on Wheels, saying he'd delivered meals to people for whom """" perhaps it's their only hot meal of the day. """"
Meanwhile Eddie Bernice Johnson ( D-Texas ), ranking member of the House Science Committee, said, """" Instead of preserving and promoting America's leadership in science and technology, this budget would put our nation on a path of decline. """"
Advocates for cutting science and medicine budgets point to the funding that agencies provide research institutions for indirect CENSOREDfrfrfr Science Committee will hold a hearing, titled """" Examining the Overhead Cost of Research, """" that will look specifically at how the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies negotiate those costs.
OMB director Mulvaney, briefing reporters, said the administration had produced a """" taxpayer-first """" budget, saying that compassion should be offered not only to the needy who receive government resources but also to the people who pay the taxes to fund such programs. """" Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation, """" Mulvaney said.
The administration's detailed budget request calls the termination of many research-related programs, such as the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy ( ARPA-E ). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's grant and education program, which has $262 million in 2017 funding, would be zeroed out. """" These grant and education programs generally support State, local, and/or industry interests, and these entities may choose to continue some of this work with their own funding, """" the CENSOREDfrfrfr Science at the Department of Energy would lose about one-sixth of its funding, a $900 million cut. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy faces a 69 percent funding cut and a 28 percent reduction in staffing. The OMB budget describes these reductions as reflecting """" an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later-stage research, development, and commercialization of energy technologies """" and focuses funding on early-stage research.
Also terminated would be NASA's Office of Education, as well as five NASA Earth Science missions that the administration considers to be low-priority. The administration said killing those Earth Science missions would save $191 million. The Trump administration is also declining to put in money for a robotic probe to land on Jupiter's moon Europa, even though that it required under the NASA authorization act recently signed into law.
NASA acting administrator Robert Lightfoot, taking the stage in an auditorium at NASA headquarters, gave an upbeat assessment of OMB's budget request, which includes a modest cut to the agency's CENSOREDfrfrfr this budget tells us to do is keep going, """" Lightfoot said.
Among key health-care changes:
Planned Parenthood would be barred from receiving any HHS funding, according to a fact sheet accompanying the budget release -- a prohibition that would apply not just to Medicaid but to all programs.

Funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) would be slashed by at least 20 percent for the next two fiscal years. According to the budget document, the administrator favors a renewal of CHIP, a program created 20 years ago for the children of lower-working class families and which currently insures 5.6 million children.
The spending plan would, however, eliminate an element of the Affordable Care Act that increased by 23 percent the portion of the program's costs that is paid for with federal money, leaving states to shoulder CENSOREDfrfrfr time essentially limit states' eligibility levels to qualify, saying that the government would no longer help cover children from families with incomes of more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, 18 states plus the District of Columbia allow families with incomes higher than 300 percent of the poverty line to sign up their children for CHIP, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
CDC already has nearly 700 vacancies under a government hiring freeze that HHS has kept in place.
The president's budget seeks an $82 million cut at the center that works on vaccine-preventable and respiratory diseases, such as influenza and measles. It proposes a cut of $186 million from programs at CDC's center on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis prevention. One of the biggest cuts, $222 million, is to the agency's chronic disease prevention programs, which are designed to help people prevent diabetes, heart disease and stroke, and obesity.
Some of those funds are being channeled into CENSOREDfrfrfr territories to focus on """" leading chronic disease challenges specific to each state. """" Critics have said block grants allow states to plug holes in their budgets, without accountability that federal programs require.
The agency's center on birth defects and developmental disabilities also gets a 26 percent cut to its budget at a time when researchers have yet to understand the full consequences of Zika infections in pregnant women and their babies and the underlying causes of autism.
The budget calls for a 17 percent cut to CDC's global health programs that monitor and respond to disease outbreaks around the world. It also cuts about 10 percent from CDC's office of public health preparedness and response.
The budget document highlights $35 million that the CDC spends on childhood lead poisoning prevention. But the overall spending on environmental health would under Trump's plan be cut by $60 million, down to $157 million, according the document.
Trump administration officials have also proposed the establishment of an Emergency Response Fund to respond quickly to emerging CENSOREDfrfrfr and Zika epidemics, U.S. officials have repeatedly called for the need for such a fund. The budget does not provide a specific amount. It says HHS would have """" department-wide transfer authority to support the Fund in the case of a natural or man-made disaster or threat. """" The fund would be available to receive a transfer of up to one percent of any HHS account, without any limitation on the total, for use in emergency preparedness and response.
The Food and Drug Administration would see a cut in federal funding from $2.74 billion to $1.89 billion. To offset the reduction, user fees paid by manufacturers of drugs, devices and other medical products, which now total $1.2 billion and cover nearly half the cost of all medical-product activities, would be increased by more than $1.1 billion. As a result, the agency's overall funding would increase by more $400 million.
But hiking industry fees is n't likely to go anywhere on Capitol Hill. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman CENSOREDfrfrfr want to reopen negotiations with the industry over fees that it pays to support FDA activities. His committee recently approved legislation that ignores the administration request for higher user fees.
The budget retains the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which had been threatened with virtual extinction, with a $368.5 million budget, a small decrease from its 2017 funding. In an email sent to full-time employee earlier this month, Richard Baum, the acting director of the office, said the administration's proposal for the fiscal year that begins in October would reflect """" a nearly 95 percent """" cut in the agency's budget. That appears to have been largely reversed.
White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called the administration's budget proposal a """" Taxpayer First Budget, """" on May 23, and defended its cuts to federal anti-poverty programs. ( Reuters )

18611429,799,17-05-24,US,PGH City Paper,http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pittsburgh-nonprofits-working-to-reduce-transmission-of-hiv/Content?oid=2946300,Pittsburgh nonprofits working to reduce transmission of HIV,"According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health's most recent data, 2,830 people in Allegheny County were living with HIV/AIDS in 2015. That year, the county saw 145 new HIV diagnoses and 57 new AIDS cases.
But the fight to end the epidemic is getting a hand from AIDS Free Pittsburgh, a local nonprofit managed by the Jewish Healthcare Foundation that seeks to reduce transmissions of HIV.
"""" AIDS Free Pittsburgh has a jurisdictional effort and a public-health commitment to end AIDS as an epidemic in Allegheny County by 2020, """" says project manager Julia Och. """" Our two specific goals are to reduce the rate of new HIV infections by 75 percent and to eliminate new AIDS diagnoses in the county. """"
Initiatives like this are n't unique to Pittsburgh. Organizations like Getting to Zero San Francisco strive for the same goals by starting treatment for HIV-positive patients CENSOREDfrfrfr with campaigns on public transportation and at LGBT-friendly spaces. Getting patients on antiretroviral drugs as soon as possible ( now often within 48 hours ) after an HIV diagnosis, instead of waiting for T-cell counts to drop as patients become sicker, has also been tremendously effective.
"""" We've found that people actually do better when people start treatment right away. Not only do they have better quality of life, but if they are virally suppressed, it's virtually impossible to spread to someone else, """" says Och.
While these interventions have suppressed transmission and bettered quality of life for those diagnosed with HIV, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Now in its second year, AIDS Free Pittsburgh is focusing on preventing initial transmission of the virus with a grant that will help pay for labs, doctor's appointments and other gap services for people who could benefit from the use of PrEP.
PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, is an anti-HIV medication that comes in the CENSOREDfrfrfr helps prevent those who are HIV-negative from contracting the virus.
The manufacturer, the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, offers a payment-assistance program to eligible HIV-negative adults to help pay for the medication for about three months. But this assistance does n't cover the appointments, testing and tri-monthly lab work required to take Truvada.
That's where AIDS Free Pittsburgh is stepping in. In hopes of increasing access to the treatment for those who are uninsured, the organization will fund gap care for patients while they search for a long-term solution to payment issues, such as affordable health insurance or Medicaid.
"""" We're very uniquely funded by the two major health-care systems Highmark and UPMC. They came together and they said,' Hey, we commit to 1.5 million dollars over five years,' """" says Och, explaining that often initiatives like this in other cities are funded by public health departments. AFP is also currently exploring the possibility of extending services to underinsured people.
But money is n't the only CENSOREDfrfrfr it comes to PrEP. Representatives from organizations around the city like Planned Parenthood, Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force and Project Silk say that there has been a lot of stigma associated with PrEP and that they are working to fight it.
"""" When it first came out, it was targeted toward the highest-risk individuals -- gay men, """" says Jason Herring, community-health director of PATF. """" Health agencies were terrified people would see it as free license to have all the sex they wanted. There is a large system of fear and shame built around sex. Stigma was instantly injected into it.
"""" We had a hard time in the beginning. I would have to call people's primary-care physicians and say,' You have a patient that needs this and I will teach you how to do it.' """"
The stigma that Truvada is only for gay men still prevails. While it's true that the two groups at the highest risk for HIV infection are men who sleep with men, CENSOREDfrfrfr sure to tell the public that PrEP is for everyone.
"""" PrEP is for women, men, people of all genders and trans folks. We want to create broader acceptance, """" says Katie Horowitz, vice president of education for Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania. """" We're getting together, getting to know each other and opening the lines of communication. """"

18626450,789,17-05-24,US,TribTalk,https://www.tribtalk.org/2017/05/25/senate-faces-daunting-task-of-improving-gops-obamacare-replacement/,Senate faces daunting task of improving GOP's Obamacare ...,"U.S. House Republicans betrayed their constituents when they voted to pass the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ), which threatens millions of Americans' health coverage. While Obamacare was widely criticized for failing to control costs, most Americans valued its guaranteed coverage. Health care is n't just a privilege like buying a new car ; rather, it's a right, on similar footing with life, liberty, privacy and freedom of speech.
The AHCA cut everything that was good about Obamacare:
Coverage of pre-existing conditions
Medicaid expansion to anyone within 138 percent of the federal poverty line
Economic subsidies for people who must buy health insurance on the private market
Availability of mental health and drug addiction services
Coverage of most prescription medications
The elimination of lifetime caps on health care services, which are devastating for the sickest Americans
The rollback of Medicaid expansion is especially concerning because the House Republicans cut over $800 billion of health coverage from our most vulnerable, poorest, and sickest in order to CENSOREDfrfrfr.
Now, the setting moves to the U.S. Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell faces the unenviable task of amending the bill so that it's politically palatable enough to keep at least 50 of the 52 Senate Republicans on board. It's going to be a tough sell for several Republican senators, including Utah's Mike Lee and Arizona's Jeff Flake, both of whom are up for re-election. And considering that Pennsylvania and Ohio are heavily dependent on federal Medicaid dollars, can Pat Toomey and Rob Portman afford to strip health care from a large number of their constituents?
McConnell may already have made a mistake by appointing a working group of 13 men -- and no women -- which could be offensive to Susan Collins ( Maine ) and Lisa Murkowski ( Alaska ). This is especially true given the current crisis of women's health in this country, as we're the one of the only developed countries where the maternal death rate rose from 2000-2014, including doubling in Texas over that time CENSOREDfrfrfr Gov. Greg Abbott refused federally funded Medicaid expansion.
Given that the current version of the AHCA cuts federal funding for Planned Parenthood in the first year and prohibits the use of federal tax credits to buy insurance that includes abortion coverage, along with allowing states to waive an Obamacare provision that required insurers to cover maternity care, revising the bill to adequately address women's health and reproductive care is critical to its viability. McConnell would be wise to solicit input from Collins and Murkowski if he wants to keep their votes.
McConnell certainly is walking a tightrope here because the House must still approve the amended version, and if the Freedom Caucus concludes that it provides too many entitlements, they likely wo n't accept it. Given this possibility, it's doubtful that McConnell even wants to try to work with Senate Democrats, who wo n't approve the bill unless it's completely overhauled in a manner that makes it unacceptable to House Republicans.
The saddest aspect of the AHCA debacle is that we've CENSOREDfrfrfr in a health care system that operates via a private, for-profit health insurance mechanism, there are only two options: guaranteed coverage with high costs or insufficient coverage with lower costs. Americans have finally accepted that our society is better off with guaranteed, universal coverage, so the logical next step for Congress should have been to devise a mechanism to lower costs, either through a single-payer Medicare-for-all system or reorganizing private insurance companies as nonprofits.
Congress should also be considering a unified health system, whereby the federal government oversees the administration of health care under one set of rules ( instead of leaving oversight to the individual states ). A unified system can enforce quality and cost-saving measures, such as compatible electronic medical records that reduce medical errors and costly duplication of tests and services. Regardless of how much the Senate manages to water down the worst aspects of the AHCA, we wo n't be getting anywhere close to the progress we deserve in our health care system anytime soon.
The for-profit health insurance industry CENSOREDfrfrfr of GDP on health care than any other developed country in the world, yet we're ranked near the bottom on nearly every measure of quality of care, including life expectancy. And Republicans in Congress appear to prefer to line the pockets of their rich donors rather than work towards a health care solution that upends this corrupt system in order to finally deliver Americans universal, affordable coverage.

( Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press )
I was surprised, then, when the next thing she said was that abortion increases a woman's risk of breast cancer. The National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have rejected that claim, citing, among other research, a 2004 analysis of 53 studies involving 83,000 women that found no link between abortion and a higher rate of cancer. Yet Yoest was insistent. """" As a breast cancer survivor, the spin on abortion and breast cancer really troubles me, """" she said. """" Why ca n't you report what the research actually shows? """" When I said the studies I'd read showed no abortion-breast cancer link, she shook her head calmly and said, """" If you could spend time with the amazing people in AAPLOG """" -- the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists -- """" they could walk you through CENSOREDfrfrfr article, """" Charmaine Yoest's Cheerful War on Abortion, """" Nov. 2, 2012
After President Trump tapped Charmaine Yoest as assistant secretary of health and human services, critics resurfaced this 2012 New York Times feature story. The Times article described Yoest's position supporting the discredited theory that abortion increases a woman's risk for breast cancer.
Yoest is a breast cancer survivor and a prominent national activist who opposes abortion rights. Until her new appointment, which did not require Senate confirmation, Yoest was the president and chief executive of Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights.
Since Yoest now holds one of the top posts at Health and Human Services, readers asked us to find out: Does Yoest still hold this position? We could n't readily find instances after 2012 where Yoest publicly repeated this claim. We reached out to her, but she would not answer whether she still believes in this alleged link. Instead, she offered this written explanation:
"""" As far CENSOREDfrfrfr will note that the wild accusations that I have said' abortion *causes* breast cancer' are false. I have not said that and would not say that. """"
We've dug into this issue before. We took another look at the research, given that the issue is back in the national dialogue. <h> The Facts
The theory that abortion is associated with a greater risk of breast cancer dates to the 1950s, and was widely promoted in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. In the 1990s, a series of studies were published in support of this link.
In 2003, the National Cancer Institute held a workshop of more than 100 experts from around the world to study whether abortion and miscarriage are linked to breast cancer. They reviewed existing research, identified gaps in research and recommended areas of future research.
Experts found that the studies published in the 1990s supporting this link were poorly designed. Subsequent, methodologically sound studies consistently showed no association between induced abortion ( CENSOREDfrfrfr risk, according to the report from the 2003 workshop. One researcher submitted a minority dissent report claiming partial disagreement with this conclusion.
The report concluded that neither induced abortions nor miscarriages ( also called """" spontaneous abortions """" ) are associated with breast cancer risk. Subsequent reviews by the American Congress of Gynecologists and Obstetricians, American Cancer Society and other medical organizations affirmed this conclusion.
There are many known risk factors for breast cancer, including: family history, the woman's age ( the risk of breast cancer increases as a woman gets older ), how old she was at her first menstrual period ( people who get their first periods later face a higher risk ), how old she was when she delivered her first full-term pregnancy ( women who have children later or who never have children face a higher risk ), certain breast conditions, certain oral contraceptives, excessive alcohol consumption and obesity after menopause.
A woman's risk is doubled if one first-degree relative has breast cancer. Her risk CENSOREDfrfrfr diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.
There also are known factors that decrease the risk, including breast-feeding and regular exercise. Having a full-term pregnancy before the age of 20 is the best lifetime decrease in breast cancer risk for women -- even if she has an abortion later in life. Women who deliver a baby before 20 face a 50 percent decreased risk of breast cancer than women who do n't give birth or give birth after 35 years old, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Still, some studies -- including some using the disputed method -- argue there is an association, and some opponents of abortion rights continue to research this alleged link. In her Times interview, Yoest pointed to data and research by the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We contacted the group, which provided us studies on the development of breast tissue in various stages of a woman's pregnancy. We uploaded the studies here.
According to the group and research from the CENSOREDfrfrfr cancer link theory, hormones produced at certain stages of the pregnancy can affect cancer susceptibility of breast tissues. The further along a woman is in her pregnancy -- specifically, after 32 weeks -- her body produces breast tissues that decrease cancer susceptibility, the groups claim.
These groups say that based on the hormone production and breast tissue development, pregnancies that end between 20 to 32 weeks double your risk of breast cancer. Whether you have an abortion, a premature delivery or a miscarriage, you become vulnerable to breast cancer if it happens between 20 to 32 weeks, according to the study by the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute.
In other words, it's that specific period in the pregnancy -- around the second trimester -- that is the problem, not the method ( premature delivery, abortion or miscarriage ).
Despite these claims of increased risk, this research does not find support in the scientific academy.
"""" There are a variety of competing hypotheses from various laboratory scientists. The best CENSOREDfrfrfr studies, """" said Robert Hoover, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.
Regarding the study from the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, Hoover said: """" As noted in the review, there is conflicting evidence in the literature about the risk of breast cancer associated with induced abortion. To date, the high-quality studies ( large prospective cohorts ) find no excess risk. This is the basis for our current assessment as stated on the Cancer.gov web site. I see nothing in this recent material that would alter this. """" <h> The Bottom Line
We provided Yoest the opportunity to set the record straight and clarify her stance on this matter. She told us she does not believe abortion causes breast cancer, but she did not answer our follow-up questions for her stance on whether abortion increases a woman's risk of breast cancer.
Research provided from the group that she pointed to in her 2012 New York Times article theorizes about the relationship between breast CENSOREDfrfrfr a woman's risk for breast cancer when the pregnancy ends before it reaches full-term -- through induced abortion, a miscarriage or premature delivery. But it is inconsistent with extensive review and medical research by experts convened by the National Cancer Institute in 2003, or the subsequent conclusions by other cancer research organizations since then.
If Yoest repeated this claim now, it certainly would be Pinocchio-worthy. But it's an old quote, and as far as we can tell, she has n't repeated it since. So we will not rate this claim. We urge readers to be skeptical of claims of an alleged association between abortion and breast cancer. <h> Voting is closed on this poll

Women in the Quad-Cities find themselves with significantly fewer options for health care, as Iowa's GOP-run Legislature achieved its ultimate goal by shuttering the region's Planned Parenthood clinic. And Iowa did n't even try to fake it by rolling out some half-baked list of alleged alternatives.
The Bettendorf clinic was among four that will close in Iowa after the state banned spending Medicaid for any procedure there, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland announced late last week. The organization and its supporters were aghast. The pro-life movement rejoiced.
And, per usual, it is impoverished women who will pay more than their share of the bill.
Medicaid, mind you, provides health care for the poorest Iowans. It's already foundering in Iowa since last year's privatization. President Donald Trump has targeted Medicaid for deep cuts in his draft budget. Hospitals and physicians typically admit CENSOREDfrfrfr There's little or no money to be made in serving Medicaid patients. In fact, patients with insurance often end up making up the difference, multiple studies have concluded.
Women across the socio-economic strata relied on Planned Parenthood. But, suddenly, those in the lower tiers are destined to have fewer options.
To these women, Iowa just said, """" Tough. """"
Medicaid -- in Iowa or anywhere else -- does n't pay for a single abortion, under federal law. No, the Legislature's play here was to structurally hamstring Planned Parenthood while maintaining legal deniability in a constitutional challenge. And, of course, lawmakers hoped to score political points. They refused to back down no matter how many warnings they heard from physicians and social workers ; partisan dogma superseded reason or constitutional right. <h> Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox

It's that yet-to-be drafted list that's at the heart of the matter. Four clinics across the state are closing. Many states that have tried similar attacks on a woman's access to health care at least attempted to compile other options. Not in Iowa. Lawmakers just did it blind and directed the state Health Department to force reality into their partisan narrative somewhere down the line.
About 4,000 women have received treatment at Planned Parenthood in Bettendorf over the past three years, the organization's officials say.

18654852,739,17-05-26,US,National Review,http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/448030/center-medical-progress-undercover-video-planned-parenthood-removed-youtube-judge,Undercover Planned Parenthood Video Removed from YouTube at ...,"Editor's Note: This post has been updated since its initial publication.
Yesterday evening, the Center for Medical Progress undercover footage -- recorded at the 2014 and 2015 National Abortion Federation conventions -- was removed from YouTube, supposedly for a violation of the site's Terms of Service agreement. ( A copy of the video can be found here. More detailed footage giving context for some of the clips is available here and here. )
A few hours later, news emerged that Judge William Orrick -- the California district judge who granted NAF and Planned Parenthood's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the release of this video footage -- had ordered the CMP's lead investigator David Daleiden and his attorneys to appear at a June 14 hearing to consider holding them in contempt for releasing the footage yesterday morning.
According to the attorneys defending CMP -- Steve Cooley and Brentford Ferreira -- they had the ability to release the footage in conjunction with California's prosecution of Daleiden and his colleague Sandra Merritt, CENSOREDfrfrfr state for recording """" confidential communications. """" More clarification from the attorneys' PR representative to National Review yesterday:
Calif. Attorney General Xavier Becerra has entered this footage into the public record by filing a public criminal proceeding based on it. The preliminary injunction obtained by NAF in a federal civil suit can not bind this State criminal proceeding. ( In fact, the SF Superior Court is now releasing certified copies of the court filings to the public with the links to the videos. )
It remains unclear, then, how Orrick had the authority yesterday evening to order Cooley and Ferreira to take down the footage and threaten them with contempt charges. National Review is awaiting further clarification from the CMP's lawyers, and more information is expected later today.
Some mainstream media outlets that did not report on the new CMP footage yesterday have posted the AP wire report regarding the possible contempt charges. Other outlets, including the New York Times, NBC, and CNN have yet to report on the CENSOREDfrfrfr undercover video and the related felony charges against Daleiden and Merritt are available here.
Update May 26, 4:15 p.m.: One of the defense attorneys for David Daleiden and his colleague Sandra Merritt tells National Review that he removed the latest undercover CMP footage from his website around 8 p.m. EST yesterday evening, after he received word that Orrick had determined the release of the footage to be in violation of the preliminary injunction he had issued in the civil case against Daleiden.
Orrick's gag order arose during the case brought against Daleiden by the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood, both of which wanted the court to prevent the release of the undercover footage from the 2014 and 2015 NAF conventions. That case is currently on appeal.
Meanwhile, Steve Cooley is one of two attorneys representing Daleiden and Merritt in their criminal case, which began in late March when Calif. attorney general Xavier Becerra charged the two undercover investigators with 14 felony counts of recording """" confidential communications. """"
According to Cooley, CENSOREDfrfrfr footage publicly available when the videos were filed as part of the proceedings in that criminal case. Cooley's decision to make that footage available on his own site was primarily an effort to make public what is already technically part of public records, in order to give the media and the public better access to information as the case unfolds.
Cooley referred to the issue as a """" conflict of laws, """" pitting a district judge's injunction against the Superior Court's decision to file the videos as part of public records. """" The blog was nothing more than a memorialization of public filings in the history of the case, """" Cooley says of the webpage where he posted the videos yesterday morning. He called California's criminal case a """" selective, ill-motivated, and ill-founded prosecution. """"
Daleiden, Cooley, and defense attorney Brentford Ferreira will appear before the San Francisco Superior Court on June 8 to receive the court's ruling on the demurrer filed in response to Calif.' s felony charges. CENSOREDfrfrfr court as part of the ongoing civil case, to consider contempt sanctions related to the release of the video footage that was subject to the injunction. """

It may not be possible to imagine a more terrible crime.
Courtney Pieters, a 3-year-old girl from a suburb of Cape Town, went missing on May 4. Her body was found nine days later, buried in a shallow grave about two-thirds of a mile from her home. She had been raped twice.
"""" This is one of the saddest incidents I've come across, """" South African President Jacob Zuma said May 18.
Her fate was not as unusual as you would wish it to be. Last year CENSOREDfrfrfr 10 most violent nations. According to police figures, each year 800 to 900 children are murdered in South Africa, a nation of 54 million people.
"""" In terms of child murders, we see in a year what the United Kingdom sees in 10 years, """" says Shanaaz Mathews, who directs the Children's Institute at the University of Cape Town ( UCT ). In England and Wales, with a combined population of about 58 million, there are roughly 135 child murders a year, according to the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics.
In South Africa, some women hide their pregnancies and dump their babies soon after birth. """" If you conceal the birth well enough, they'll never be found, """" says Lorna Martin, a forensic pathologist who has performed thousands of autopsies in Cape Town, """" so we do n't know how many babies are being murdered. """" Still, municipal workers sometimes find corpses of children discarded by the side of the road, or along riverways CENSOREDfrfrfr are leading a pilot project that examines the cases of all the dead children in the busy mortuaries outside of Cape Town and Durban, respectively the nation's second and third largest cities. Their pilot study of cases in 2014 found that the rate of child homicide is substantially higher than what has been reported in police statistics.
"""" Every three or four months, there's a story in the newspaper that they found a fetus or a baby abandoned in a dustbin somewhere, and the child died, """" says Dr. Chris Scott, a Cape Town pediatrician who participates in the death review process. """" We are seeing several of those a month in our study. It's a complete epidemic that no one's speaking about. """"
Perhaps that will start to change with the attention being paid to the Pieters case. The Children's Institute, UNICEF and the national Department of Social Development, along with other groups, sponsored a two-day conference this week to find ways to reduce violence against children. CENSOREDfrfrfr time shocked the conscience of the nation, sometimes leading to protests. Yet after the initial shock from those individual incidents wears off, the problem has largely been shunted aside.
Responsibility for the prevention of child homicides is split between different agencies, meaning no single entity has embraced it as a priority or mission.
The pilot child death review panels being sponsored by UCT are specifically designed to promote cooperation among the various players. Pathologists and other doctors are brought together with prosecutors, police and social workers. They determine whether a child's death was likely accidental or homicide. If it looks like murder, a prosecutor might instruct the police then and there to pick up the file and start investigating.
The panels are not just looking for murder. Many other causes of death involving young children should be preventable. By closely studying each case, the assembled experts can look for patterns and figure out how to keep more children from dying.
For example, after the panel in Durban found CENSOREDfrfrfr put pressure on local authorities to address the problem of illegally-connected electric lines and to offer safety tips to parents.
In some cases where children died because of severe negligence, their siblings have been taken from the home. """" They were removed because it was deemed to be too unsafe for them to stay where they were, """" Martin says. """" That would never have happened if it had not been for this child death review process. """"
Child death review panels first sprang up in the U.S. about 20 years ago in Missouri, driven by similar concerns about child abuse that resulted in homicide. There are now review panels in place in every state, which may be run locally but are generally overseen by state public health departments.
Their portfolio has expanded well beyond abuse cases, leading to improved policies and practices that have shrunk the number of deaths from suffocation and sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ). """" We just understand the deaths better because we investigate them better, """" says CENSOREDfrfrfr Review and Prevention. """" We have a pretty robust review program in the U.S., even though there are no dedicated federal dollars to do this. """"
Child death reviews are now standard in rich nations but are still highly unusual in the developing world. """" What they're doing in South Africa is one of the first times this has happened, especially doing it in such a systematic way, """" Covington says.
What the South African researchers have found is that most of the murders of children happen in two phases of life: newborns up to children under 5, who are usually killed by adults, and pre-teens and teenagers, who are primarily killed by their peers.
Despite the nation's liberal abortion and contraceptive laws, a study from UCT and the South African Medical Research Council last year noted that """" there are numerous barriers that women encounter when seeking a legal abortion in the public sector, """" ranging from religious objections by health care workers to lack of trained staff to perform CENSOREDfrfrfr to dump them or otherwise kill them after birth. """" There are so many mothers who obviously feel they ca n't get a termination and instead would conceal their pregnancy and conceal their baby and then murder the child, """" says Lorna Martin, who heads the division of forensic medicine at UCT. Such deaths are called """" concealment of birth """" by the South African police, not murder, which explains why police figures are lower than the murder rate found by the death review teams.
Neonaticide, or murder of newborns less than a month old, is mostly committed by the mother, according to the UCT/Medical Research Council study. Among slightly older children, the killer may be the boyfriend of the mother or may be the father himself, says Albert Fritz, minister of social development for the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town. """" It's just impossible to believe that one human being, in many cases the biological father of the child, can do this to a child, """" CENSOREDfrfrfr child murder plaguing South Africa. As young as 9 or 10, boys are killing other boys, junior gangsters sent to kill off members of other gangs, either as part of turf battles or in an effort to kill off rivals' younger recruits.
"""" After they move up in the ranks, then they must start to kill, """" says a homicide detective in Cape Town, who can not be identified by name because of his position. """" Currently, I've got four active cases where kids were murdered. """" In one of the cases, he said, the suspects were 18, 14, and 13.
Getting convictions, or even testimony from witnesses, is difficult, the detective says. If the shooter is under 15, it's practically impossible to prosecute him anyway, because children under 14 are considered incapable of criminal responsibility under South African law.
The horror of Courtney Pieters' death has made the murder of children a subject of discussion and media coverage, CENSOREDfrfrfr, Zuma called the killing of women and children a """" crisis """" in the country.
Within the medical community, at least, the child death review panels has made professionals much more aware of the scope of the issues involved. There's hope of expanding such work throughout the country.
"""" It's a situation born out of poverty and desperation, """" says Scott, the Cape Town pediatrician. """" It's a situation born out of poverty and desperation. """"

"""" We've looked at what might make members of Congress, particularly Republicans, break with Trump. They are the ultimate deciders of how much of his agenda is passed, and even of his fate in any kind of process to push him out of office. We've also looked at how voters, particularly Republicans, view the president and whether they are likely to stick by him.
But it's kind of obvious to say that Trump's standing depends on how Republican voters and GOP members of Congress feel about him. The more complicated question may be: How do those two groups make up their minds about the president? What Trump does, first and foremost, but their decision-making is also likely to be influenced by how other major groups in the Republican Party treat Trump.
What are the major blocs of the GOP, outside of elected officials and voters CENSOREDfrfrfr science splits parties into three main wings: the party-in-the-electorate ( voters ), the party-in-the-government ( elected officials and appointees ) and the party-as-organization. The """" organization, """" in turn, """" is comprised of many groups. Think of Fox News, which conservatives and Republicans watch much, much more than other national news channels. Or activists' groups such as Heritage Action, which tries to push the GOP away from social welfare spending ( Medicaid, Obamacare, etc. ) and keeps a scorecard of the votes of members of Congress. The Koch brothers run a network of conservative groups, both nationally and in states, so vast that Politico referred to it as a """" privatized political party. """"
You can describe the party-as-organization wing in a lot of different ways, and Trump's success in 2016, particularly in the GOP primary, suggested that journalists, political scientists and even GOP officials themselves may have had an incomplete understanding of how today's Republican Party works. In 2016, there was perhaps an CENSOREDfrfrfr Trump from winning the nomination, if it chose to do so.
That said, since Trump was sworn in, the party-as-organization appears to be strong. The president has largely not delivered ( or really even tried to deliver ) on his promises to provide """" insurance for everybody """" in his replacement for Obamacare or to or bring back factory jobs -- goals that linked Trump and some of his voters but did n't appeal to key constituency groups in the GOP organization. Instead, Trump signed on to both a health care bill and a budget that would reduce federal spending on Medicaid, as his party's fiscal hawk wing wants, as well as a number of provisions to limit abortions, a passionate cause of religious conservatives.
So, after speaking with some political scientists and Republican operatives, examining the groups that spent the most money electing Trump and Republicans in Congress and looking at the president's moves in his first few months in office, I came up with an informal list of six blocs CENSOREDfrfrfr wing. ( Along with listing and describing each bloc, I included a current Republican politician whose ideology resembles that bloc, just to help clarify the distinctions. )
So if you're looking for defections from Trump, watch these blocs. Here they are, ordered from most to least likely to break away from the president:
Many conservative intellectuals were in the Never Trump movement from the start. For Trump, these defections, if they happen, will not be surprising and perhaps are not all that meaningful either: He won the GOP nomination and the presidency while shunning the party's wonks.
Why should the president care about these people at all? House Speaker Paul Ryan, who controls the fate of Trump's agenda, is close to this wing of the party. Some of his closest allies work at Washington think tanks.
This bloc, and all the others below, have said very few negative things about Trump. There is a big gap between the party's think-tank CENSOREDfrfrfr every other bloc.
But why might small-government conservatives be less than completely loyal to Trump? Well, Trump is not truly a small-government figure. He has not proposed overhauling Medicare or Social Security's retirement program, as these conservatives want.
Who is more likely to share their views? Mike Pence. The vice-president was the leader of the Republican Study Committee in the House, which was the most rightward part of the House GOP until the Freedom Caucus came along. Small-government conservatives might get more of their agenda enacted if Pence were in the Oval Office. <h> 4. Conservative business groups/Wall Street
Business conservatives almost always get their way in Republican administrations. Trump, like George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, is pushing an agenda of tax cuts and eliminating regulations. So this wing of the party is fine with Trump so far.
On the other hand, Pence would almost certainly sign these same bills just as happily. If Trump is becoming an impediment to their agenda, key party CENSOREDfrfrfr Trump so forcefully. <h> 3. Religious conservatives
You might think that this group would be very pro-Pence and anti-Trump, since the vice-president is a devout Christian and the president is not. But white conservative evangelical activists really like Trump. He is enacting limits on abortion rights and Planned Parenthood, some of their core goals, although Pence would likely do the same.
But there's one other reason why conservative evangelical groups might prefer Trump to Pence. Think about it this way: Would Black Lives Matter activists have more leverage in a Hillary Clinton administration compared to Barack Obama's? Probably. Pence's conservative Christian bonafides, like Obama's with African-Americans, ca n't really be questioned. Therefore, religious conservatives are in a place to make demands of Trump, noting that his intense support from white evangelical Christians is one of the main reasons that the president was elected. <h> 2. Cultural identity conservatives
The anti-immigration, antiglobalization wing of the GOP needs Trump to remain office, because it CENSOREDfrfrfr. It is hard to imagine another Republican president, even Pence, employing Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller as top policy advisers, proposing a travel ban from majority Muslim-country countries or even considering a withdrawal from NAFTA.
Why might they turn on him? In some ways, this bloc's agenda is tension with all of the groups listed above, except for Christian conservatives. The party intellectuals strongly supported Trump's decision for a military strike in Syria, but this group was more skeptical. Business conservatives do n't want the U.S. to leave NAFTA and favor more trade agreements. This group is more anti-free trade. Cultural identity conservatives may have nowhere else to turn from Trump, but their strong support for the president is not guaranteed if he starts governing more like a traditional, big-business Republican.
The simplest way to illustrate this: What would Trump have to do for Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity to start criticizing him regularly?
Actually, we do n't have to guess. As Matt Grossman and CENSOREDfrfrfr """" Hannity and other conservatives on TV and talk radio started sharply criticizing George W. Bush near the end of his second term. Bush's approval ratings were fading among conservatives, amid the struggling Iraq War and his bungled handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. And Hannity and other radio and television hosts were blasting Bush's advocacy of a bill that would grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants.
In other words, Bush was already unpopular, and he was proposing an idea -- citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- that was more popular on the left than the right. Trump may want to consider this example before he starts touting, say, his daughter's proposal to allow new parents six weeks of paid leave. Trump's numbers are already declining, even among Republicans, and paid leave is an idea that liberals love and conservative activists really do n't.
Earlier this year, my colleague Nate Silver listed 14 possible scenarios for Trump's presidency and suggested one possibility was for the president to shift left CENSOREDfrfrfr of another **38;839;TOOLONG, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made the pivot after initially struggling in California.
Why could n't Trump do that? Well, the various scandals around Russia have left the president desperately needing support from his own party. That support likely comes with strings attached: Trump needs to implement the policy goals of the party's key blocs -- or they might turn on him, and he does n't have strong public support to fall back on.

Before we get into the debate here over whether it's appropriate for graduating college students to protest their commencement speakers, I want to share my own observation about a growing trend in parental manners at these events.
In recent years, I've delivered a dozen or so commencement addresses and attended at least a dozen more for family and friends. With one exception, because of a scheduling snafu, I've sat through the entire ceremony. Increasingly, I have to remind myself to keep my jaw closed as I sit there onstage and watch one family after another bail as soon as their graduate walks across the stage.
Entire families just stand CENSOREDfrfrfr as a dozen people at once. Parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, siblings and in-laws of every stripe -- standing up in unison and jabbering away as they collect purses, flowers, jackets and babies and traipse right out of there. In the past couple of years, I've seen many of their graduates decide to join them, standing up on the floor and pointing at the exit where they'll meet them.
So, if we're going to talk about commencement etiquette, let's start there, shall we? Your graduate may be the center of your universe, but let's do try to remember there are a lot of other shooting stars in their orbit. Sit back and enjoy the constellation.
Now then, about Notre Dame.
Vice President Mike Pence was invited to deliver the commencement address at the Indiana university.
He came with some baggage.
Before Pence became Donald Trump's chief enabler, he was governor of the state of Indiana.
CENSOREDfrfrfr Pence signed the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This law allowed business owners who do n't like same-sex couples -- that includes Pence, who said same-sex marriage could cause """" societal collapse """" -- to legally deny them services. The backlash was so fierce -- and potentially damaging to Indiana's economy -- that Pence signed a revised version of the law.
However, Americans who oppose this bigotry -- hellooooo, millennials -- are n't willing to let him off the hook.
So, there's that.
There's also this: In 2016, Gov. Pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. As NPR reported last year, """" the law bans abortions due to fetal abnormalities and also requires aborted fetuses -- and those from miscarriage -- to be buried or cremated. """"
Because it was n't already hard enough to be a woman in Indiana trying to control her own body and the health of her family. She needed to be officially shamed, too.
CENSOREDfrfrfr attention to this current administration, you already know that. If you're not, let's acknowledge how lucky you are to live in a country that lets you be a citizen anyway.
At Notre Dame's commencement, 100 or so graduates walked out after Pence was introduced and started to speak. They exited silently and then locked arms and sang after they were outside.
What an interesting turn of events at Notre Dame.
Except that it's not. Hundreds of anti-abortion activists protested Notre Dame's 2009 commencement speaker, President Barack Obama. Vice President Joe Biden had his share of protesters, too, when he delivered the commencement address last year.
I understand why some people in attendance wish the protests had n't happened. You want everything to be perfect for your graduate throughout the day -- or at least for as long as you plan to sit there ( ahem ). For many, that means a few hours without any reminder of the trouble we're in right now CENSOREDfrfrfr that, if everybody in America got that same respite from what Pence and this administration are trying to do to people.
As protester Bryan Ricketts told CNN, after explaining how Pence's homophobia has affected him as a gay man, many graduates at Notre Dame have been directly targeted by other policies -- for example, those students and their families who are undocumented and who risked deportation to celebrate this milestone in their lives.
This is why I love so many of these millennials. They have little patience with the notion that an invitation alone cloaks a speaker in respectability. They also know that the time to speak up, particularly for those who ca n't, is right now.
For many, this is bound to be uncomfortable.
Most growth spurts are.

Jim Bunning, a major league pitching star who took his aggressive, no-nonsense brand of competitiveness into the game of politics as a congressman and senator from Kentucky, has died at the age of 85.
A strong right-hander with more than 100 wins and a no-hitter in each of the two major leagues, Bunning enjoyed national fame as an athlete before capturing Kentucky's 4th congressional district in 1986.
The staunchly conservative Republican from Northern Kentucky's Campbell County easily won four successive two-year terms before giving up his House seat to run for the U.S. Senate in 1998. He served in the Senate from 1999 to 2010.
At 6 foot-3, Bunning was physically imposing, and on both the baseball diamond and Capitol Hill he was known for a toughness that could be intimidating.
"""" He was a hard man, but you'd want him on your side because you knew he would be ready to play and he would give you everything at his command CENSOREDfrfrfr wrote years ago.
He was referring to Jim Bunning the pitcher but he could just as well have been talking about the politician.
In his 15-year career in the big leagues, Bunning developed a reputation for throwing the ball close to batters, trying to back them off the plate. """" If he had to brush back his mother, I think he'd do it to win, """" former Detroit Tigers second baseman Frank Bolling said of his one-time teammate.
In his second career, instead of baseballs, Bunning went after opponents and issues with strong rhetoric and an intense certainty in the correctness of his own views.
That was especially true with abortion. A Roman Catholic with nine children, Bunning voted consistently to limit abortion as an option for women and had contempt for colleagues who softened their position on the highly emotional issue.
"""" My training, from the very first day that I was trained as a kid, was that anything like that was wrong, """" the Jesuit-schooled CENSOREDfrfrfr only legally wrong, but morally wrong. """"
Principled &amp;amp ; mdash ; that&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s how admirers described Bunning. To critics rigid was a more appropriate adjective. Unafraid of confrontation and unencumbered by an active sense of humor, Bunning could come across as pugnacious. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; &amp;amp ; ldquo ; He&amp;amp ; rs... as negative as any person I&amp;amp ; rsquo ; ve ever met in my life, &amp;amp ; rdquo ; state Sen.

When an interviewer once suggested his House votes were easy to predict, he replied, &amp;amp ; ldquo ; Thank you, I appreciate that. &amp;amp ; rdquo ; &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; While warm and fuzzy were definitely not his style, in private he could be personable and engaging. &amp;amp ; CENSOREDfrfrfr with a more cooperative person, &amp;amp ; rdquo ; former Rep. Andy Jacobs Jr. of Indiana, a fiscally conservative Democrat who cooperated with Bunning on Social Security legislation, once said. &amp;amp ; ldquo ; He&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s a peach. &amp;amp ; rdquo ; &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning had run-ins with Democrats more liberal &amp;amp ; mdash ; and more partisan &amp;amp ; mdash ; than Jacobs, but sometimes fellow Republicans also felt his sting. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In both the state Senate, where he served one term, and in the U.S. House, he criticized GOP leaders as too willing to embrace compromise, a commodity with which Bunning was never comfortable. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; &amp;amp ; ldquo ; There are a lot of compromises you can make in politics, but your principles are not one of them, &amp;amp ; rdquo ; he said in a 1997 remark aimed at the House leadership team headed by Speaker Newt Gingrich of CENSOREDfrfrfr But as former GOP House leader Bob Michel of Illinois once put it, a lawmaker&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s &amp;amp ; ldquo ; sharp edge tends to get rounded off&amp;amp ; rdquo ; the longer he or she serves, and even Bunning was not immune to that process. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; After he had been in Congress a few years, he voted for a Democratic deficit-reduction bill even though it included a child-care program that he considered excessive. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning &amp;amp ; mdash ; whom former Republican Rep. Fred Grandy of Iowa once called &amp;amp ; ldquo ; a fiscal Shiite&amp;amp ; rdquo ; &amp;amp ; mdash ; told a reporter after the vote, &amp;amp ; ldquo ; Now I would never have done that compromising six ( or ) eight years ago. I think that&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s some progress. I really do. I think I&amp;amp ; rsquo ; m seeing a bigger picture on a daily basis up here. &amp;amp ; rdquo ; &amp;lt ; CENSOREDfrfrfr race he made a noticeable effort to appear more moderate, talking about the need to clean up the environment and educate children, endeavors that he had not emphasized previously. In fact, in the House he voted to cut the Environmental Protection Agency budget and kill the U.S. Department of Education. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; The move from his Northern Kentucky base to the statewide stage also brought attention to his propensity for slinging rhetorical fastballs. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In early 1997, as he was gearing up his Senate candidacy, Bunning told a Cincinnati radio show that Louisville had been devastated by recent flooding because the city failed to put up its floodgates in time. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; The remark, an implicit criticism of Democratic Mayor Jerry Abramson, was totally in error &amp;amp ; mdash ; and an embarrassment for the would-be senator. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; But the lessons learned by Bunning and the changes in him were at the margins CENSOREDfrfrfr seemed a little less dogmatic. But Bunning ended his political career pretty much the way he started it. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; &amp;amp ; ldquo ; Sometimes when you believe very deeply in an issue, very deeply, people take that for being arrogant and aggressive, &amp;amp ; rdquo ; he once told a Courier-Journal reporter. &amp;amp ; ldquo ; I think it&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s being honest. &amp;amp ; rdquo ; &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; James Paul David Bunning was born Oct. 23, 1931 in a Covington hospital, the second of three sons. His father, Louis Bunning, worked four decades for a Northern Kentucky company that made ladders. His mother, Gladys Best Bunning, was from a Bracken County farm family that had moved to Newport. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; His parents were, their famous son later said, &amp;amp ; ldquo ; very ordinary, salt of the earth people&amp;amp ; rdquo ; who worked themselves out of tight finances CENSOREDfrfrfr &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; The Bunnings scraped together the money to send their middle child to Jesuit-run St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, where he was a standout in basketball, football and baseball. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; He went to Cincinnati&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s Xavier University on a basketball scholarship but continued playing other sports. After his freshman year, the Detroit Tigers signed him to a $150-a-month contract but with a clause allowing him to miss spring training until he finished college &amp;amp ; mdash ; which he did in three-and-a-half years. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Also while in college, he married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Catherine Theis. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning had to supplement his minor league salary with various jobs, but he made it big in 1957, his first full season with the Tigers. That year he won 20 games, pitched three perfect innings in the All-Star Game and was second in American League strikeouts. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt CENSOREDfrfrfr, but he won 19 in 1962 and, after being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1964, he reached 19 three years straight. His career total was 224 wins. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning was best known for pitching a no-hitter in each of the two leagues &amp;amp ; mdash ; for Detroit in 1958 against Boston in the American and for Philadelphia in 1964 against the New York Mets in the National. The latter was a perfect game. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning retired as a player in 1971 and managed minor-league teams for five years. In 1996, after just barely missing election in earlier years by the nation&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s sportwriters, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; &amp;amp ; ldquo ; It&amp;amp ; rs... been a long waiting process. Thank God it happened while I was still on my feet, &amp;amp ; rdquo ; he said on the House floor CENSOREDfrfrfr /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In his baseball years, Bunning was a stockbroker and player agent during the off-season. He was also a Republican, and credited the Jesuits with instilling in him a strong belief in the free-enterprise system. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In the 1968 presidential race he headed Athletes for Nixon. But it was not until he gave up managing and returned to Northern Kentucky as a full-time resident that he became heavily involved in politics. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In 1977, at the request of friends, he ran for and won a seat on the non-partisan Fort Thomas city council, and two years later he successfully challenged veteran state Sen. Donald Johnson, who had recently left the GOP and become a Democrat. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; In 1983, still a freshman, Bunning ousted state Sen. Eugene Stuart of Jefferson County for the post of Senate minority leader, and later that year he became his party&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s nominee CENSOREDfrfrfr governor. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Even with his star quality as an ex-athlete, Bunning was not expected to win, given the state&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s heavy Democratic registration and organization. But the campaign allowed him to work on his intense, stiff public style, and his 44 percent showing was respectable. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; So when veteran 4th-District Republican Rep. Gene Snyder decided not to run for re-election in 1986, Bunning was a natural GOP choice to replace him. In November he beat Democratic state Rep. Terry Mann by a comfortable margin, and once he had the seat, Bunning had no trouble keeping it. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; That was due in part to the large political contributions he got from business interests. He was also helped by his 1991 appointment to the House&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s influential Ways and Means Committee. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; He became ranking Republican on the panel&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s Social CENSOREDfrfrfr GOP&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s 1995 takeover of the House. Social Security issues, especially legislation to allow seniors to earn more without losing Social Security benefits, were a major focus of his House career. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; But clearly, Bunning was anxious for bigger things. He considered a second try for the governorship, but with Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford&amp;amp ; rsquo ; s long-anticipated retirement, Bunning set his sights on that open seat in the 1998 elections. While the heavy GOP favorite, he first had to defeat state Sen. Barry Metcalf of Richmond in the primary. &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; &amp;lt ; p&amp;gt ; Bunning lived in Southgate, the same community where he grew up. &amp;lt ; br/&amp;gt ; &amp;amp ; nbsp ; &amp;lt ; /p&amp;gt ; """

Jim Bunning, an imposing Hall of Fame pitcher and a cantankerous, resolutely conservative U.S. Senator from Kentucky, died Friday at age 85.
The New York Timesreports that he had a stroke last October. The AP confirmed the death with Bunning's former chief of staff, Jon Deuser.
Bunning served six terms in the House and two in the Senate. As a major league pitcher from 1955 to 1971, he played for the Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, CENSOREDfrfrfr only Hall of Fame baseball player to have served in Congress, according to the AP.
The six-foot-three ballplayer had a reputation as intimidating. As the Louisville Courier-Journalwrites:
"""" In his 15-year career in the big leagues, Bunning developed a reputation for throwing the ball close to batters, trying to back them off the plate.' If he had to brush back his mother, I think he'd do it to win,' former Detroit Tigers second baseman Frank Bolling said of his one-time teammate.
In his second career, instead of baseballs, Bunning went after opponents and issues with strong rhetoric and an intense certainty in the correctness of his own views.
That was especially true with abortion. A Roman Catholic with nine children, Bunning voted consistently to limit abortion as an option for women and had contempt for colleagues who softened their position on the highly emotional issue. """"
In 1964, Bunning pitched a perfect game, one of just 23 in the modern era. It was CENSOREDfrfrfr 1880. In addition to throwing no-hitters in both the American and National Leagues, he was also the second pitcher after Cy Young to win 100 games and pitch 1,000 strikeouts in both leagues, according to the Hall of Fame. Bunning was inducted into the Hall in Cooperstown, NY., in 1996.
On June 21, 1964, Bunning pitched a perfect game, the ninth in major league history.

18682921,2046,17-05-28,US,Mashable,http://mashable.com/2017/05/28/handmaids-tale-protests-costumes/,How 'The Handmaid's Tale' has become the meme of the resistance,"Earlier this week, 18 women dressed up in red cloaks and white bonnets, stood in pairs in the rotunda of the Texas state capitol, and began chanting, """" Shame! """" in unison. They did n't stop shouting for eight minutes.
They call themselves the Texas handmaids. You probably first saw them back in March, when images of their original protest in Austin went viral. That's when they sat silently in the Texas senate gallery, watching as lawmakers debated bills that would make it harder for women to get an abortion.
What you may not know is that their demonstrations, inspired by Margaret Atwood's classic dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale and Hulu's vivid TV adaptation, are slowly spreading across the country.
Women are holding sewing parties to turn yards of blood-red fabric into capes. They're swapping ideas on private Facebook pages about how to stage protests. They're CENSOREDfrfrfr show up at state capitols or in other public places in cities across the country.
If the visually striking meme takes off, it could become one of the most effective acts of protest from the resistance. The sight of even a dozen women wearing the handmaid costume, while staying silent and keeping their heads down, offers a stark contrast to a group of mostly white men deliberating over what happens to their bodies. The imagery is practically made for the digital era.
The point, activists say, is to send a powerful message: We're closer to a government that strips women of their bodily autonomy than you might think.
"""" The easiest way we try to explain it is that the handmaids represent a future where women are nothing more than their reproductive capacity, """" says Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. """" Unfortunately, with the laws that are being passed, that future is not so unrealistic and not so distant. """"
We're closer to a CENSOREDfrfrfr might think.
The idea to enlist Texas women as handmaids started with Busby a few months ago. She happened to see women dressed as the title character from The Handmaid's Tale at South by Southwest. That was a marketing stunt by Hulu, the streaming entertainment provider that brought Atwood's novel to the small screen.
But Busby then joked on Facebook about how someone should send the handmaids down to the capitol, where lawmakers had been busy introducing bills that would curtail abortion rights. Soon NARAL Pro-Choice Texas ordered white bonnets from Amazon Prime and a volunteer rented red capes. A small group of volunteers quickly drew up a plan. They liked the element of surprise in showing up at the capitol in costume -- and wanted to let legislators know that women were watching.
After that yielded local and national press coverage of the legislative agenda in Texas, activists around the country started reaching out to Busby for tips on how to start their own handmaids brigade.
You could argue that all CENSOREDfrfrfr nowhere close to becoming the Republic of Gilead, The Handmaid's Tale's totalitarian, theocratic state that freezes women's bank accounts, forbids them to work, sends them to re-education camps, and forces many of them to bear children for leaders and their wives.
TheNew York Times' conservative columnist Ross Douthat argued this week that liberals are seeing the wrong parallels. On the same day, Times op-ed contributor Mona Eltahawy wrote that the Republic of Gilead already exists in Saudi Arabia, where women ca n't drive and may be imprisoned for disobedience. For her part, Atwood has said that nothing in her novel has n't already happened before in history.
"""" I still have a credit card, I still have a nice car, but I can feel the future here. """"
For the volunteers who are deep into the work of creating and wearing the costumes in public, it's not about whether they still have credit cards or the right to get a job. What they see is CENSOREDfrfrfr conservative, even authoritarian, men who've vowed to defund Planned Parenthood and roll back reproductive health rights like abortion and access to affordable birth control. At the same time, those men plan to funnel money to abstinence-only education and vouchers for """" school choice, """" which includes religious schools.
The fact that they're led by Donald Trump terrifies these women.
"""" We have somebody in the White House who thinks it's OK to grab women and do whatever he wants, and I'm supposed to sit back and be cool with that? """" says Emily Morgan, executive director of Action Together New Hampshire, an activist group that emerged in the wake of Trump's election.
Earlier this month, Morgan contacted Busby for details on how to create handmaid costumes. But instead of bringing women into the New Hampshire legislative gallery during a debate or hearing, Morgan and her co-organizers asked them to appear at a press conference calling for the resignation of Rep. Robert Fisher, a Republican who The CENSOREDfrfrfr of Reddit's popular men's rights """" Red Pill """" forum. The message board bills itself as a """" discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men, """" and Fisher regularly questioned whether rape is real, according to TheDaily Beast. ( Fisher resigned later in the day following the press conference. )

"""" Fisher and the Red Pill embody exactly what TheHandmaid's Tale is a foreshadowing of or is a warning against, """" Morgan says. """" Saying that we're not there -- it's sort of degrading to what's actually happening to women. """"
In the days before the press conference, volunteers made six costumes, but some of the women bowed out after learning the media would be in attendance. Morgan says they feared in-person and online harassment. Nevertheless, she thinks more women will step CENSOREDfrfrfr in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire are sewing new cloaks so that activists in New England quickly have access to them for future protests.
The time-intensive, costly aspect of buying the bonnets and making the cloaks is one challenge to growing the handmaid ranks. There's also the danger that different groups will splinter in an effort to launch the first nationwide demonstration. Morgan is moderating a private Facebook page to coordinate a national action. A similar page started by one of the Texas handmaids has close to 300 members.
The handmaids' signature costumes are also a relatively obscure reference compared to pussyhats, the knit pink caps that have become a symbol of the resistance. But they're also memorable even if you do n't know the origin.
Ane Crabtree, the costume designer for the Hulu series, says the outfit's visual power is rooted in both the bright red color, which can signify blood, birth, and passion, and how the cloak conceals women who wear it. The CENSOREDfrfrfr how the body underneath the costume is oppressed.
"""" It's an easy form of expression to say that everything's been taken away and is being taken away, and it's a real thing, """" says Crabtree, who is encouraged and inspired by people making their own version of the costume.
Deborah Marsh, a 65-year-old retiree who is one of the Texas handmaids, says people who get the reference often approach her on the street or in the capitol's rotunda to thank her profusely for the act of defiance. Some, however, have seen the symbolism and do n't like it. Marsh says a few people on the street have had """" outbursts """" or called the women """" pathetic. """"
Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion rights nonprofit group Texas Alliance for Life, seemed to criticize the handmaids a few times, focusing on the fact that they've used smartphones while silently protesting in the gallery, a silly point that Marsh feels makes their case about men who CENSOREDfrfrfr Marsh did n't expect was how confident she would feel while wearing the costume. """" It's such a bold costume, it's making such a bold statement, """" she says. """" And my body is inside that costume, so why would n't I feel bold? Why would n't I feel empowered? """"
Among reproductive rights activists like Marsh, the Texas legislature is infamous for its anti-abortion legislation. In 2013, the state passed a law that effectively led to the closure of dozens of abortion clinics, which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional last year. The Republican-led legislature recently voted to ban the safest type of second-trimester abortion and require hospitals and abortion clinics to bury fetal remains, including those from miscarriages that happen at home. Texas has already moved to keep Planned Parenthood from state and federal funding.
In other words, as Texas limits access to both abortion and reproductive health care like birth control, it's easy to imagine a future in which women have little practical control over how CENSOREDfrfrfr be limited to Texas either ; other Republican-dominated states are pursuing a similar agenda with regard to limiting access to reproductive health care, as is the Trump administration.
"""" I still have a credit card, I still have a nice car, but I can feel the future here, """" Marsh says. """" If people are n't affected by it today, they are going to be affected by it in four yours. Texas is a little bit ahead of the game. """"
"""" Am I going to change someone's mind who is pro-life? I do n't expect that. I'm aiming higher. I want to change the culture. """"
Stephanie Martin, a mom from Round Rock, in central Texas, who recently dressed up as a handmaid for the first time, says she's realistic about who the message is going to reach.
"""" Am I going to change someone's mind who is pro-life? """" she asks. """" I do n't expect that. I'm CENSOREDfrfrfr """"
It's still early to gauge exactly how that culture will respond beyond the videos and photos that have gone viral. But the parallel between the male aggression and control that characterizes Gilead feels particularly fresh in a week where a Republican congressional candidate body slammed a reporter for asking a question he did n't like, and the president appeared to shove aside a European leader to get a better position in a photo-op.
Let's not forget the complicity of Ivanka Trump, who promotes herself as a champion of gender equality but says nothing critical about healthcare and budget proposals that are arguably hostile to women. Nor can we ignore the benign-looking malevolence of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who could n't come up with a single instance of discrimination at publicly funded schools that would give her pause when asked about it at a congressional hearing. In Gilead, after all, the women who are not outrightly oppressed get the privilege of wielding what small power they have against the vulnerable and marginalized.
Morgan admits CENSOREDfrfrfr happening today and Atwood's fiction. Yet she urges skeptics to focus less on a dramatic, sweeping end to women's rights. What's more important, at this point, is the underlying implication of attitudes and laws that see no harm in making it more difficult or even impossible for women to determine their own fate.
"""" These are steps on the same path, """" she says of the parallels between Gilead and Trump's America. """" You have to start somewhere. """"

They'll sit at a long table before someone unknown to most Americans but with singular power to influence whether Republicans can follow through on their seven-year quest to remake President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.
That person is Elizabeth MacDonough -- the Senate parliamentarian, who is charged with acting as Congress's version of a referee in the contentious health-care debate. MacDonough and her small staff will decide whether the Republican-crafted bill sent over from the House meets the requirements allowing it to be considered under special budget rules designed to protect it from Democratic defeat.
Before MacDonough, Democrats will argue that the GOP measure known as the American Health Care Act ( ACHA ) bleeds over the boundaries of what can be accomplished under budget rules known as """" reconciliation. """" Republicans will insist CENSOREDfrfrfr provisions that affect federal spending.
MacDonough will listen carefully to both sides. She'll ask questions. She wo n't appear to favor one side. And when she makes a decision, it will be based on her best understanding of Senate rules and precedent -- not on whether she approves or disapproves of the Affordable Care Act or the effort to repeal it, multiple friends and former co-workers say.
MacDonough's rulings on past ACA repeal efforts suggest that she may side with Republicans in some instances. But the new GOP bill is different in that it tackles ACA repeal and attempts to replace portions of it.
MacDonough """" is in my view completely unbiased and she cares about the institution and she follows the precedent that has been established, """" said David Schiappa, who for years worked closely with her as secretary for Senate Republicans.
Bill Dauster, a longtime counsel to Senate Democrats, said: """" I've always felt I could get a fair hearing. """"
MacDonough declined a CENSOREDfrfrfr people who talk much but affect little. MacDonough is the opposite -- she intentionally stays out of the spotlight, but wields enormous influence in proceedings on the Senate floor, where she, her deputy and several assistants continually advise senators on arcane procedure and a complex set of rules that few people really comprehend.
MacDonough, who attended a preparatory high school in Connecticut and holds degrees from George Washington University and Vermont Law School, worked her way up in the Senate, starting as an assistant parliamentarian in 1999 and serving for 13 years before the Senate approved her as parliamentarian in 2012 at the recommendation of then-Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D-Nev. ).
Observers say it is a stressful role, especially as the environment in Congress has grown more partisan and toxic. Although past Senate leaders have ousted parliamentarians for decisions they did n't like -- and the Senate majority leader has the ability to do the same to MacDonough -- the job is still widely considered nonpartisan. Part of being perceived as fair to CENSOREDfrfrfr herself.
"""" My experience with her is that she is fair, """" said Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ), who acts as the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, which has had extensive interaction with MacDonough and her team. """" She has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. """"
Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ), said the Senate is """" fortunate """" to have MacDonough's guidance.
"""" The parliamentarian is a brilliant lawyer, a thorough and fair referee, and a walking encyclopedia of Senate precedent and procedure, """" Stewart said.
But the health-care debate into which MacDonough is about to step could challenge even her reputation for fairness.
A budget reconciliation bill needs just a simple majority in the Senate to be approved -- not the 60 votes typically required to overcome a filibuster. That permits Republicans to pass their health-care legislation with just 50 of their 52 members, with tiebreaking help from Vice President Pence.
But CENSOREDfrfrfr can pull them. Each piece of such a bill must be directly related to federal spending, such as a tax or expenditure. Repealing certain parts of the ACA, such as its taxes, for example, fits easily under this standard. But other parts, such as rolling back the law's insurance regulations, do n't necessarily qualify.
MacDonough's primary task over the next few weeks will be to rule on whether the AHCA qualifies as a budget reconciliation bill. If she finds that individual parts of the bill would n't have a direct budgetary impact through a process known as a """" Byrd bath, """" those parts would be stripped out. That does n't mean, however, that the House would have to vote again on its measure -- just that lawmakers could consider only a pared-back version.
Most health-care experts think MacDonough will strip some parts of the House bill -- indeed, many House Republicans are holding their breath regarding some of the AHCA's riskier elements.
The parts most CENSOREDfrfrfr of protections for people with preexisting conditions, or its provision raising the ratio for how much insurers can charge older people relative to younger ones. Those elements are insurer regulations not directly related to federal spending, but some Republicans have argued an indirect link by noting that premiums would be affected and therefore the amount of subsidies the government must pay out.
Another questionable part of the House bill is its language banning federally subsidized insurance plans from covering abortions. Abortion opponents insisted that such a ban must be included, even though that, too, might raise MacDonough's eyebrows.
Republicans already have a sense of how MacDonough might rule. A year and a half ago, she and her deputies analyzed a measure aimed at repealing some of the ACA but not replacing it. Although Obama ultimately vetoed that bill, House and Senate Republicans passed it partly as a readiness exercise should they eventually win the White House.
Staffers writing that 2015 House measure did n't attempt to repeal large parts of the ACA CENSOREDfrfrfr from conservatives, the Senate added provisions to eliminate the insurance subsidies, Medicaid expansion and small- business tax credits. Notably, MacDonough went along with those changes.
Heartening conservatives, MacDonough ruled that a section in that measure banning Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements could remain. The measure said Medicaid money could n't go to certain abortion providers, without explicitly mentioning the group.
Under her guidance, the Senate was forced to tweak language repealing the individual and employer mandates, technically leaving the requirements in place but eliminating the penalties.
There are those preparing preemptive plans should MacDonough disappoint them.
A few of the more conservative senators -- including Ted Cruz ( Tex. ) -- have suggested that McConnell could replace MacDonough if she rules against them -- or at least allow the Senate president to overrule her.
But that lack of support is n't widespread. Those who know MacDonough say they're not surprised that she does n't give interviews or speak publicly because she takes her job as an unbiased adjudicator CENSOREDfrfrfr a more expansive interpretation of budget rules say they are not worried about MacDonough judging health care.
"""" I have complete confidence in her ability to interpret Senate rules, """" said Michael Cannon, a health-policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.
Cannon has argued extensively that virtually every part of the ACA is closely tied to government spending.
Cannon used to live in MacDonough's neighborhood, and he says they'd run into each other while walking their dogs. They also visited the same dentist -- once during an appointment, he saw her photo displayed on the office wall as a testament to great teeth.
"""" She's got such a great smile, the dentist put her picture up in his office, """" Cannon said.

Patrick has repeatedly threatened a special session over the bathroom bill and the property-tax reform bill as the regular session has drawn to a close, and his position was unchanged at the last gavel on Monday afternoon.
He told senators he would see them """" a little sooner """" than the next session, in 2019, and said in a statement, """" We will continue to celebrate these victories of conservative principles and governance and we will continue to fight the battles that remain -- particularly on property taxes and privacy, which remain' must-pass' legislation. """"
All signs point to a possible special session -- at the cost of $800,000 to taxpayers.
House Speaker Joe Straus announced Friday that the House would not compromise with the Senate any further on these two issues, prompting dueling news conferences between him and Patrick over the weekend in which CENSOREDfrfrfr ( worth noting is that both men are Republicans ).
Patrick had first threatened a special session last week, saying that if the House did not pass the bathroom bill or property-tax reform, he would hold hostage must-pass legislation called a """" sunset safety net """" bill. Every so often, lawmakers have to review various state agencies in order to keep them open. But if those reviews need to be postponed, legislation is required ; otherwise the agencies have to close. One of five state agencies facing possible closure is the Texas Medical Board, which licenses all doctors in Texas.
Good luck finding a doctor in Texas if there's no special session to pass the sunset bill, Patrick told reporters at a news conference Sunday. Even though the Senate had the opportunity to pass it, Patrick still blamed the House for the bill's failure -- and vice versa. Straus and House members simply viewed the Senate's failure to pass the sunset measure as Patrick's way to force a special session CENSOREDfrfrfr Abbott can call a special session and decide what bills will be considered during the session, and he told reporters after a news conference Monday morning that he will make that decision later this week.
The bathroom bill and property tax reforms notwithstanding, here's a look back at some of the most high-profile legislation that made it through the Legislature.
1. Governor Greg Abbott signed the controversial SB 4 privately. Taking the win in a tight race for most controversial bill of the year, SB 4 gives street cops the authority to ask anyone -- including children -- about his or her immigration status while detaining a person for any reason. It also subjects sheriffs or police chiefs to a criminal charge and removal from office if they do n't honor ICE requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants. Two lawsuits have already been filed against the state claiming that SB 4 will encourage racial profiling, and police leaders from the largest cities in Texas have already bashed the law and supported the litigation. Abbott, apparently CENSOREDfrfrfr, fearful citizens, decided to sign the bill on Facebook live on a Sunday night. He gave no advance notice.
2. The Legislature took strides to address the state's foster-care crisis. With an overburdened and underfunded Child Protective Services agency, and with some foster kids stuck sleeping in CPS offices awaiting placements because of a shortage of homes, Abbott made finding solutions an emergency item this session. What lawmakers came up with: expanding the system into a """" community-based care """" model, allowing the state to contract with nonprofit organizations willing to take over some of CPS's case management duties and undergo training for how to handle kids with behavioral health issues. Reports that came out last year showed CPS was failing to check on thousands of the state's most at-risk kids, and legislators expect these looming changes to alleviate some of the pressure on CPS caseworkers.
Children who are under conservatorship also are required to have medical exams within three days of any new placements. But Republican lawmakers managed to CENSOREDfrfrfr ultimately passed an amendment barring foster kids from receiving the shots during these required medical exams. The bill awaits Abbott's signature.
3. Abortion. Lots of restrictions on abortion. Get ready for another potential court battle. This year's abortion bill, Senate Bill 8, was primarily pitched as a bill to ban and criminalize """" partial-birth """" abortions on the state level -- something that is already illegal on the federal level. But it also bans the most common second-trimester abortion procedure, in which doctors remove fetal tissue from the womb using surgical instruments. Despite medical experts' testimony that it is the safest method for second-trimester abortions, conservatives call it """" dismemberment """" and say it is inhumane. Among other things likely to go to court is the provision to require hospitals and abortion clinics to find a way to bury or cremate all aborted fetuses, including fetal remains from miscarriages. Apparently Republican lawmakers did not get the memo that a federal judge has already blocked this practice when the Texas Health and CENSOREDfrfrfr ; that court case is pending. Senate Bill 8 also bans the donation of fetal remains, even for medical research. The bill is now on Abbott's desk.
4. The Sandra Bland Act passed -- but without addressing the problem with her arrest in the first place. Overall, the Sandra Bland Act is a good bill. It requires law enforcement to make a """" good faith effort """" to divert people charged with nonviolent misdemeanors to treatment facilities rather than jail if it looks as if the alleged offense is a result of the person's mental illness, intellectual disability or substance abuse problem. The law makes securing a personal bond easier for mentally ill or intellectually disabled defendants. And it requires independent law enforcement agencies to investigate jail deaths.
But for being a bill named after Sandra Bland, the legislation does nothing to address what led to Bland's being in jail in the first place: her violent arrest after she failed to use a turn signal. Bland was pulled out of CENSOREDfrfrfr put out her cigarette. The officer threatened to use a Taser on her as she questioned why he was grabbing and arresting her. Senator John Whitmire originally included a provision in the bill that would have banned arrests for non-jailable traffic offenses -- but he removed it at the urging of law enforcement groups. And even though authorities say Bland committed suicide in the Waller County Jail just a few days after her arrest, she did not have a history of mental illness, and so it is unclear if the bill's provisions would have even applied to her. """" What the bill does in its current state renders Sandy invisible, """" Sharon Cooper, Bland's older sister, told the Associated Press. """" It's frustrating and gut-wrenching. """" The bill awaits Abbott's signature.
5. Lawmakers voted to bring the state's voter ID law into compliance with a federal order. After federal courts found that Texas's restrictive 2011 voter ID bill had a disparate impact on minority voters -- and that Texas CENSOREDfrfrfr new voter ID law an emergency item. The bill mostly mirrors the federal order that fashioned new rules for the November 2016 general election, allowing people who did not possess a photo ID to still vote using other forms of identification, such as birth certificates, bank statements and utility bills. They could then cast ballots after explaining in an affidavit the """" reasonable impediment """" preventing them from having a photo ID. The final version of the bill, signed off on by both chambers over the weekend, makes lying on an affidavit a state jail felony. This compromise came after the House wanted to make it a misdemeanor and the Senate wanted to make it a third-degree felony. This bill also awaits Abbott's signature. """

Planned Parenthood recently released its 2015-2016 annual report. ( Kevin Hagen/Getty Images )
The May release of the 2015-16 report was a departure from the organization's typical December or January release.
According to the report, Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, performed 328,348 abortion procedures in 2015, an increase from the 323,999 abortions it performed in 2014.
While Planned Parenthood performed more abortions, it saw about 100,000 fewer patients. The organization's 2014-15 annual report states that they had 2.5 million patients in 2014, but the 2015-16 report states that Planned Parenthood saw 2.4 million patients in 2015.
The two annual reports also reflect a decrease in Planned Parenthood's """" cancer screening and prevention """" services, which include such things as pap tests CENSOREDfrfrfr 682,208 total cancer screening and prevention services, while in 2015 they reported 665,234 such services.
The reports also show a decrease in prenatal care at Planned Parenthood clinics. The organization reported 17,419 """" prenatal services """" in 2014, but that number plummeted to 9,419 in 2015.
2015 was a year marked by controversy for Planned Parenthood. In July of that year, the Center for Medical Progress, a pro-life organization, releaseda series of undercover videos alleging that Planned Parenthood was trafficking aborted fetal body parts. Profiting from the sale of human body parts -- including those of the unborn -- is illegal in the United States.
Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied illegal conduct and said they were merely reimbursed for donations to researchers.
The annual report also takes aim at the pro-life filmmakers, characterizing them as """" anti-abortion extremists """" and their videos as """" heavily edited. """" The report laments that """" attacks """" against Planned Parenthood """" have reached a fever pitch """" and that Planned Parenthood is at risk CENSOREDfrfrfr a law firm representing the Center for Medical Progress released a new video recorded by the pro-life group showing Planned Parenthood employees describing abortion procedures in gruesome terms.
A judge blocked the Center for Medical Progress from releasing undercover footage its filmmakers recorded of conversations that took place at the National Abortion Federation's 2014 and 2015 annual conferences. The pro-life group is currently appealing the injunction.
The video circulated by the law firm was described as a preview of the footage that is under injunction. Soon after the video was published, a judge said it violated the injunction and ordered it removed from YouTube. It is still available on Twitter:

According to The Huffington Post, """" The White House Office of Management and Budget posted on its website that it is reviewing an interim final rule that would allow religious employers to deny contraception coverage to their female employees. The details of the rule have not been announced, but Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president of the National Women's Law Center, said it is certain that' some women will lose birth control coverage.' """"
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi responded to the administration's """" sickening """" move, saying, """" The draft rule announced today attempts to tear away women's control over their own private health decisions and put that control in the hands of employers and politicians. """"
What's particularly troubling about Trump's move is that the Obama-era mandate it plans CENSOREDfrfrfr The Huffington Post notes that the benefit saved them $1.4 billion on contraceptive coverage the first year it took effect. The rule has also pushed the abortion rate in the United States to the lowest level since abortion became legal.
HuffPo notes that the Center for Reproductive Rights plans to challenge the expected move by the administration, with the group saying, """" Countless women will lose their basic right to prevent pregnancy and plan when they have children. """"
Trump is making a move that clearly panders to his base of voters, but it's a move that will hurt millions of women in America and make abortion more frequent -- two things people of both political parties should oppose. """

The meeting was led not by a representative of Planned Parenthood, but by Erika Christensen, 36, and her husband Garin Marschall, 39, self-identified """" amateur activists """" who are unrecognizable by name or face but whose story has been read by more than 2.4 million people.
Last year, when she was 31 weeks pregnant, Christensen learned that the baby boy inside her had stopped developing and would die nearly instantly upon birth, choking for air. Due to a previous brain injury, the force of a vaginal delivery could kill her, so doctors would have to perform a C-section if she brought the baby to term. The doctors recommended an abortion, CENSOREDfrfrfr doctors from terminating a pregnancy after 24 weeks -- except in instances where the mother's life is in immediate danger -- Christensen had to travel out-of-state for the procedure.
At eight months pregnant, a few days after Mother's Day 2016, Christensen and Marschall flew to Colorado. If TSA agents told her it was n't safe for her to fly, Christensen had been advised to tell them she was six months pregnant with twins. The couple borrowed money from family and spent $10,000 out-of-pocket for a procedure that can cost up to $25,000. Christensen shared her experience to Jezebel anonymously in a powerful interview with then-editor Jia Tolentino that attracted the attention of state legislators, activists, and women across the country who have shared the same burden.
In an op-ed recently published in Rewire, Christensen wrote, """" I lay on the table, looking up at the ceiling. My internal questions played like a tape over and over in my mind: Why am I here? Did New York expect me to carry CENSOREDfrfrfr and die? Since then, I've tried to answer that second question. The only answer I've come up with is: yes. """" Despite this, Christensen considers herself lucky -- at least she could afford to go through with the out-of-state procedure. Low-income women are forced to birth babies that will die immediately, or will fight to live every day of their short lives.

One year later, the couple has chosen to put themselvesat the forefront of the fight to reform the law that forced them to flee the state like criminals. """" I do n't think any of us are really thrilled to put ourselves out there like this, """" Christensen said to the dozen or so people in attendance. """" But we're now more angry than we are sad. """"
"""" Nobody knows about this, nobody cares about it, """" said Marschall, as he led the group through a PowerPoint presentation about New York's current abortion law. """" There's a big CENSOREDfrfrfr This is not on the radar, it's not on the map at all. """"
The New York state senate is scheduled to end its session on June 21. If it ends without passing a reform, another round of New York women will be forced to endure the traumas that Christensen did. """" Yes there are huge problems, yes Trump is literally driving the country over a cliff, """" Marschall said at the meeting, """" but this we can affect, and it could help people. And it could help people this year if it were able to pass. """" <h> New York's Abortion Law
There's a common misconception that New York, a bastion of progressive politics, is a safe haven for abortion rights. """" Many, many New Yorkers, legislators, and people on the street just assume New York state has good reproductive health laws because we're a progressive blue state, """" said New York State Sen. Liz Krueger in a phone interview with Jezebel days after the CENSOREDfrfrfr were the first in the country, the law we passed, by modern standards, was pretty lousy law. """"
Early-term abortions were legal under common law in America until the 1800s, when anti-abortion physicians sought to increase birth rates among white, Protestant women and to maintain their power in the medical establishment as it opened up to women. New York criminalized abortions in 1828, entering an """" abortional act """" into its penal code, alongside homicide and manslaughter.
Except in instances where it was deemed necessary to save the mother's life, abortion remained a punishable crime through the 1960s. But as public pressure from activists and feminists grew, in 1968 New York's Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller asked a commission to review the abortion ban. When a reform bill came to a vote in the General Assembly on April 9, 1970, New York's lawmakers were split on the issue.

Assemblyman George Michaels, a pro-choice Democrat who represented a rural, conservative county in the CENSOREDfrfrfr vote with his """" hands trembling, """" according to the New York Times. """" I realize, Mr. Speaker, that I am terminating my political career, but I can not in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that defeats this bill, """" said Michaels. """" I ask that my vote be changed from' no' to' yes.' """" Michaels's vote did indeed end his decade-long political career, but it paved the way for legal abortion access, turning New York into the first state to legally provide abortions to both out-of-state and in-state residents.
The New York state law that Michaels helped pass, which stands today, revised the penal code to create an exception for a """" justifiable abortion """" as one that a doctor provides within 24 weeks of a woman's pregnancy or in instances when the woman's life is at risk. For three years, New York was the nation's leader on abortion rights. Then, with the passage of Roe CENSOREDfrfrfr, rendering the state law moot -- or so it seemed.
Advertisement
The state law technically makes providing an abortion after 24 weeks a Class D felony, punishable by up to two to seven years in prison, and makes self-induced abortions a misdemeanor crime. By specifying """" duly licensed physicians, """" the law also deters certified midwives, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants from providing first-term abortions, even though they are qualified to do so and play a big part in increasing access to early care. """" There's a direct conflict between New York state law and constitutional law, """" said Katharine Bodde, policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. """" That means that women like Erika are being sent out of state if they can afford to go out of state, or are being forced to carry a doomed pregnancy to term, """" she said. """" Which is pretty cruel. """"
According to the Guttmacher Institute, only seven states -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine CENSOREDfrfrfr consistent with Roe v. Wade. New York is unique because, out of the four states that legalized abortion pre-Roe v. Wade, it's the only state that has n't revised the law.
The penal code also criminalizes self-induced abortions. """" Having a law that directly criminalizes self-induced abortion is extremely rare. Only seven states have such laws, """" said Farah Diaz-Tello, an attorney with the Self-Induced Abortion Legal Team. """" These are mostly hold-over laws from Roe. """" However, the state rarely prosecutes women for self-induced abortions because it's difficult to prove what ended a pregnancy ( the last arrest for self-induced abortion that Diaz-Tello recalls happened in 2011, but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the case over lack of evidence ). """" If Purvi Patel had been in New York, she also would have been criminally prosecuted, """" she said, referring to the Indiana woman who was convicted of feticide after self-inducing an abortion in 2013 ( though, Diaz-Tello notes, the degree of the crime would have been different CENSOREDfrfrfr York is """" long overdue in addressing, """" she said.

In theory, constitutional law supersedes New York state law, and in 2016, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declared that """" New York's criminal law can not penalize reproductive health decisions protected by the U.S. Constitution. """" However, even with Schneiderman's assurance, risk-averse hospitals adhere to state law and reserve the right to terminate hospital privileges or fire doctors doctors who violate it, said Dr. Stephen Chasen, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College and maternal fetal specialist who takes care of high-risk pregnancies like Christensen's. Chasen has been championing abortion rights in New York since he offered expert testimony challenging the partial birth abortion ban in New York in 2004. While a hospital might provide special, case-by-case approval to perform a late-term abortion, the process can be too lengthy when a woman's health is deteriorating. The gap between the state law and the federal law is """" a black line, it's CENSOREDfrfrfr About two-thirds of abortions take place in the first trimester of pregnancy, and nearly 99 percent happen before the 20th week. According to the the Guttmacher Institute, it's unclear how many of the 1.3 percent of abortions that happen after 20 weeks are due to health risks or fetal abnormalities that arise late in the pregnancy, but a majority of women receiving late-term abortions learn about their pregnancies late and face more hurdles in accessing abortion than women who receive them in the first trimester. Studies have found that 47 to 95 percent of women may chose to terminate their pregnancies after a major genetic of fetal anamoly is detected in the second trimester ( demographic differences between the populations studied likely account for the wide range ).
Advertisement
"""" If you're talking about an uncomplicated pregnancy, 24 weeks might be a reasonable place to draw the viability line and say that in general, a baby born alive after 24 weeks with aggressive neonatal care has a good chance of survival, """" said Chasen. """" But CENSOREDfrfrfr. """" Chasen adds, too, that a fetus can survive in utero with a lethal fetal abnormality -- like a fetus without a kidney or a heart -- but can not survive beyond the womb, or survive with a reasonable quality of life.
In some cases, delaying the removal of the fetus in a complicated pregnancy can also cause health problems for the mother. For example, if a woman breaks her water in the second trimester before there's amniotic water around the fetus, the fetal lungs will not develop. The woman might stay pregnant with a fetal heartbeat, but every day that a woman stays pregnant, she's at risk of getting a bacterial infection of the blood called sepsis, which increases the risk of her health, Chasen explains. But the state law prohibits Chasen from terminating the pregnancy until he determines that his patient is lying at death's doorstep, which is hard to predict. """" A woman can go from her health being at risk to her life being at CENSOREDfrfrfr to walking towards the edge of a cliff. """" You do n't know when you're over the cliff until you're over the cliff. """" Chasen says that New York's state law directly impedes his ability to provide urgent and critical care to his patients. """" It makes no sense. It goes against everything you think you are as a physician, """" he said.
Advertisement
There are no statistics on how many women require abortions due to complicated pregnancies in New York. But it's uncommon for Chasen to go more than a few months without seeing patients with severe fetal abnormalities like Christensen's. """" Being an abortion provider is not a separate thing from maternal fetal medicine specialist, """" he said. """" A general surgeon does n't have to lobby to be able to take out a gall bladder the way he or she thinks it's safest and when he or she thinks it's safest to do. """" <h> The Reproductive Health Act
The solution exists in The Reproductive Health CENSOREDfrfrfr up to date with Roe v. Wade. First, it would decriminalize abortion ( including self-induced abortion ) by moving it to New York's health code. It would also permit licensed abortion providers to terminate pregnancies after 24 weeks when deemed medically necessary. """" The Reproductive Health Act would help us act on behalf of the woman's health, """" Chasen said.
The bill traces its origins back to former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, and has since gone through multiple revisions that have stalled in the state legislature. The latest version of the RHA, cosponsored by Krueger and Democratic Conference Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, passed the Assembly in January. It now sits at the footsteps of the Republican-controlled senate. Krueger, who witnessed Republicans sweep the midterm election and ramp up their assault on reproductive rights in 2010, assembled the New York State Bi-Partisan Pro-Choice Legislative Caucus to educate lawmakers about abortion rights and choke support for anti-choice bills as they were drafted. """" I decided that in New York, we needed to play offense CENSOREDfrfrfr said. """" I'm proud to say that in a country where even blue stateshave been passing anti-choice bills over the last six years, none of those have made any traction or moved in the New York State legislature. """"

But with the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-majority Congress, there's a new sense of urgency to pass reform -- and more at stake if it fails. """" In the era of Trump, Roe v. Wade could be overturned, """" she said. What Krueger envisions as a likelier scenario, however, is that Republicans will """" go statehouse by statehouse """" and """" pass terrible bills that cut away at protections of Roe v. Wade """" -- even more aggressively than they've been doing since 2010. If those laws are challenged and win in the court, they will be the new precedent, she says, """" that technically supersede Roe v. Wade. """"
"""" At that time, after the first one hits and we lose, even saying Roe CENSOREDfrfrfr. And then all we'll be left with, in New York state, is this 1970 statute that in certain circumstances, your doctor is n't going to go to jail for performing abortions, """" she said. """" That's not a reproductive health law.

"""" I think it's really important for people to understand that we have a lot of smoke and mirrors instead of a solid statute, """" she continued. """" And you can go to red states statutes in the country and find far better laws on their books than you can in New York. """" <h> Effect On Women
Planned Parenthood, the National Institute for Reproductive Health, and the NYCLU are among several organizations that have been lobbying for the RHA for years, with little success. """" One of the things we kept hearing in the senate over and over again was,' Show me a woman who ca n't get an abortion in New York state,' """" said Bodde, adding that the response """" CENSOREDfrfrfr between what was happening on the ground and our policy makers. """"

The NYCLU has been gathering stories of women and girls affected by the law for years: In one tragic case, a 12-year-old girl was sexually assaulted. Her parents did not learn that she was pregnant until she was at 26 weeks -- past the state limit to receive an abortion, which makes no exceptions for rape or incest. """" She was a tiny girl with anemia, and she faced health risks if she were forced to carry her pregnancy to term and deliver vaginally, """" the report notes. """" But a C-section would also be a health risk. It would likely weaken her uterus and jeopardize her ability to have children later in life. Termination was the best course, but now it was n't available to her in New York. """"
Another woman discovered that the fetus had polycystic kidney disease at 20 weeks. Further testing was required, but then Hurricane Sandy struck and shut down the hospital. CENSOREDfrfrfr with life, it was too late for her to get an abortion in New York state. Unable to afford to travel and pay for the procedure, she was forced to deliver a still birth, further jeopardizing her health. During delivery, she suffered a hemorrhage that could have killed her. Thankfully, she survived.
"""" We collected these stories, and it's certainly really difficult -- there are so many reasons why a woman would n't want to have her story published, and we ran into that a lot, """" said Bodde. But then, through the Jezebel interview, Bodde found Christensen and Marschall. """" I can go into an office and I can talk until I'm blue in the face, but it changes it so much when a woman like Erika and her husband Garin walk into a room and share their story, """" she said. """" There have been several moments where legislators have actually gotten emotional because of Erika and Garin sharing their story. """"

CENSOREDfrfrfr June, with a focus on the budget for the first three months. This schedule gives activists just three months to aggressively lobby lawmakers and pressure them to bring the RHA to a vote. Christensen, Marshall, Bodde, and others are turning up the heat. The couple recently launched a social media campaign and website to raise awareness about the RHA. The NYCLU has circulated a petition.Christensen has rounded up stories from other women and presented them to senators.
In one such story, Moira*, 36, did not realize her pregnancy was at risk until an ultrasound revealed that her baby boy's brain had stopped growing and was filled with fluid at 26 weeks. """" I've always considered myself pro-choice, but to be honest, there was a part of me that, for all my adult life, thought that by the time you'd be at 26 weeks you'd know if something was wrong, """" she told Jezebel. """" I thought that a late-term abortion was for someone who has n't CENSOREDfrfrfr not true. """"

The prognosis was microcephaly and hydrocephalus -- traumatic brain injuries that, according to doctors, would leave her son with severe disabilities. Moira was told her baby would be """" lucky """" to live beyondfive years old. Doctors advised an abortion, but by law, Moira could n't receive one in New York. So at the 28th week of her pregnancy, Moira and her husband flew to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the procedure. """" It feels like a you're a criminal. Like you're doing something outside the law, """" she said. The flight, rental car, hotel stay, and procedure cost the couple about $12,000. None of it was covered by insurance.
"""" My moral compass says that that's not right and that I had to take this pain and sadness so that my son would n't have to live trapped in a broken body, """" Moira said. """" I challenge any of those people in Albany who are making this CENSOREDfrfrfr sat with my dead son and face that. """" <h> Lobbying Senators
Christensen and Marschall have visited Albany three times in the past several months and said that while some senators were moved by their stories, others were skeptical of the proposed reform. """" Might I recommend, for therapy, if something traumatic has happened to you, say it out loud to people 300 times. And then it actually starts to lose a lot of its power! """" Christensen joked.

She recalled that one Republican senator's aide told her, """"' We ca n't support this bill because they said podiatrists would be giving abortions.' This is what we're dealing with, """" she said. """" Literally, another one said to us: so she could just get an abortion for a headache at 30 weeks? """" She was told that including the provision for """" health of the woman """" is """" too broad. """" And last year, Republican Assemblyman Ron Castorina referred to abortion as """" CENSOREDfrfrfr have been working to educate senators, particularly Republicans, about the benefits of the bill. """" It's really important for people to understand lots and lots of folks -- including legislators -- have questions they do n't understand. And they're not sure who to go to to ask because they're the ones who are supposed to know, """" she said.
Through these off-the-record conservations, she believes that the bill has the support it needs to pass into law. """" I believe there are multiple Republicans who may not go on the bill as co-sponsors, but if it comes to a vote on the floor, will in fact vote for the bill. But we've get to get it to the floor, """" she said.

This point is crucial: the bill can not reach a vote if it's not brought to the floor. And that decision lies with the Health Committee, chaired by Republican State Sen. Kemp Hannon, or Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. CENSOREDfrfrfr not support the Reproductive Health Act, and though Kemp has not publicly commented on the bill, it's unlikely he would support it. ( Flanagan's office did not respond to Jezebel's requests for comment. )
When Christensen and Marschall met with Hannon in April, they described him as """" obstinate """" and """" not interested our story at all. """" He made it very clear that """" he would not support this bill, """" Christensen said.
So with time running out, what's the next move? """" To get a vote on the RHA this session would take the Governor using his skills and political muscle to pressure Sen. Flanagan to bring the bill to the floor, """" Krueger said via email. She's referencing Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has shown support for the bill. In January, Cuomo announced that his administration was proposing an amendment to New York's constitution that would expand abortion and contraception coverage, requiring health insurers to cover medically necessary abortions and """" codifying the CENSOREDfrfrfr state constitution. """" However, an amendment could take years longer to put in place than simply passing the RHA in the next month. <h> Turning to Activism
After Christensen terminated her pregnancy last year, she left her corporate job and the couple moved from Brooklyn to a smaller city in another state to focus on recovering. They found a fixer-upper and spent six months putting up drywall, sanding and painting walls, and rebuilding a staircase. Then, at the end of August, Christensen had what she thought was her third pregnancy, and second miscarriage, in two years.

She was shopping at Whole Foods when the blood came rushing, soaking her like she was in """" a total crime scene. """" Marschall left her in the bathroom and ran out to get her new clothes. Worried about her fertility, they made an appointment with a specialist. That's when they learned that Christensen was four months pregnant. The incident at Whole Foods, doctors said, was most likely CENSOREDfrfrfr found out that I was pregnant, we started to refer to the baby as Furiosa because she was so ferocious in there and we were cooking her pretty much entirely on rage and disappointment, """" Christensen said. """" Now she's just this loveable, adorable little baby. """"

"""" Every time we went to the doctor, we were terrified, """" she said. Doctors used the word """" perfect, """" Christensen could feel the baby kicking and moving, and all of the ultrasounds were normal. """" We'd feel momentarily relieved, and then the cycle would start again, where we'd feel okay for a few days, and then we'd see the next appointment coming, and then we'd get nervous again. """"
"""" We were braced the whole time, """" she said. """" I'm still in denial that we have a healthy baby. """"

Christensen was nine months pregnant when the NYCLU invited her and Marschall to lobby with them in Albany CENSOREDfrfrfr against a blizzard, they drove seven hours north to the statehouse to meet with lawmakers and activists and delivered their first public speech about the abortion in front of hundreds of people in near-freezing temperatures. They made the 14-hour round trip twice more in the months that followed -- once with their four-week-old infant in tow.
Through an online support group, Christensen continues to hear from women like Moira. """" Now I know that this is a thing, I feel that this happens on my watch, """" she said. Their suffering, along with the birth of her daughter, has helped her stay engaged with activism full-time. """" I think to us, working on this stuff is focusing on her. She's a girl. I do n't want my daughter to have to be schlepping to Albany, doing this work for us in 18 years. """" """
